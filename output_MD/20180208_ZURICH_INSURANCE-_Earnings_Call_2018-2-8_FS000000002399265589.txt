Before we start with the Q&A session, I will just hand over to Mario to make a few
introductory remarks to the results. Mario?

FINAL

Mario Greco

{BIO 1754408 <GO>}

Thank you, Richard. Good day to all of you ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for
joining us. Let me make a few remarks before George and I get to your questions. First of
all, I'm very, very pleased with our full year results. I'm pleased because it demonstrates
that we're making progress against the targets that we set in November 2016, and we're
getting traction in achieving these targets.
2017 has been a challenging year, so nothing has been really easy and which makes our
achievements even more relevant, especially given the weather events that we faced. The
expense plan is well on track as we wish it to be, $700 million of achieved savings at the
end of 2017. I think it is a good demonstration of the discipline that we have been
introducing, and we followed through the years. And it talks well about what we will
deliver over the next two years.

Bloomberg Transcript

The Property & Casualty business has clearly improved in the second half of the year. The
top line is not just stabilized, but it started growing again. The composition of the new
business through 2017 has been what we wanted to achieve, which also says that we have
reestablished clear communication of our strategy, of our appetite, of our underwriting
priorities with the markets and with the brokers.
The underwriting performance has also moved for better. The accident year loss ratio
shows a clear improvement and the same is for the other underwriting expense ratio. I'm
also pleased to see that our reinsurance program, which we changed a year ago, has
worked less and has protected eﬀectively the capital and the P&L of the company in such
a tough year. We are deﬁnitely focused on improving the underwriting performance.
In underwriting, we're pleased, but we know that the journey is a much longer one and
that we have to continue making improvements. But we're conﬁdent now that we know
what improvements are and that they can be achieved. Pricing is getting better. We do
see positive pricing movement, especially in North America. And we expect this to
continue during the year and to give us some good support.
Life had an extremely strong year. BOP is up 11%, even taking into consideration in that the
UK recent changes on taxes of unit-linked products. The product mix has improved and
this has sustained our margin growth in the year and the new business value increase.
The bank distribution, which has been a strength of Zurich, has continued to be very
successful. The South American business has further developed the Spanish business with
the banks, but then has also grown very nicely. And we added, at the end of the year, a
new business in Australia with ANZ Bank which we think will perform equally well starting
from this year.

FINAL

Farmers had a very tough year, especially for the natural catastrophes. But through this
year, they have improved combined ratio very eﬀectively and they ended up the year with
much better customer results, customer satisfaction and retention. And they reached the
highest historical peak of customer satisfaction at Farmers.
Premium growth has been very successful, and again, all these evidences support us in
being optimistic and conﬁdent on 2018 and following year. Capital has always been a
strength of Zurich and still at the end 2017, our capital position is very strong. Z-ECM is at
132% and, of course, we will continue managing our balance sheet in an active way, and
we will continue looking for ways to further improve our capital position.
Now, coming to capital into the decision we proposed yesterday to the board, the most
visible and relevant one is about the increase in the dividend. You all know that George
and I've been speaking about raising the dividend since November 2016. We knew that
this was in the plan. We're pleased to see that we can do this already this year. But we
knew that this was achievable for us anyway.

Bloomberg Transcript

The reasons that we gave to the board were the strong performance of 2017, but even
more the conﬁdence we have in further improving this performance in 2018 and in the
following years. The business is getting better. We're getting better traction on the
business and these are the two elements that convinced the board to approve the
proposal and bring it to the AGM.
We also proposed a change in the capital policy in order to avoid dilution to shareholders
from the past and for the future. And again, the board has supported that as a wise policy
for shareholders' rights. Just to sum it up, before I leave it to questions, we're pleased
with the results. We think that we are delivering on what we promised to you, and we have
conﬁdence that this will continue in 2018 and in 2019, and we will continue delivering on
the targets that we announced to you in November 2016.
I'd like to stop here. And George and I are happy to take all your questions.

We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our ﬁrst question comes from
Farooq Hanif from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Oh, hi there. Thank you very much. Given the statements that you've made about your
conﬁdence on the 95% to 96% combined ratio, where does that leave us in 2018? I mean
to ask in a clunky way, do we just assume that you're kind of halfway there? And to what
extent does the expense ratio play a part now in that?

Page 3 of 24

And then, very quickly on the Life business, it looks like if you add back the UK one-oﬀ
that you're getting to, sort of the $340 million to $350 million-ish run rate, obviously, we
have to take currency into account relative to the factors, but where would you say the run
rate is and the growth prospects for that? Thank you very much.

FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Hi, Farooq. It's George. So I'll take those. So starting with the combined ratio topic, just a
reminder for everyone that we're looking for a combined ratio of 95% to 96% by 2019
given the plans that we've got. I guess it might be a bit generous to say that we're halfway
there.
I think if you look at the results, I mean they're strong in almost every single corner, other
than this area around the P&C result where we're not quite yet where we want to be. And I
think if you look at it, I mean the biggest challenge within that is commercial. It's a topic
that we had already started to look at in depth as we put the plans together for 2018, so
this was back in September where we've all worked hard with Jim Shea on what changes
are required in the portfolio to really drive the improvement that we need to see. I mean
we can see a number of areas where we can make signiﬁcant changes. Those are steps
that we put in motion already. So I mean this is a year where we expect to see signiﬁcant
improvement.

Bloomberg Transcript

I'm going to avoid giving combined ratio guidance for 2018. I think it's important to focus
on where we're trying to get to overall. I mean if you look at the entire business, we've
obviously beneﬁted from a very strong performance around the retail/other side of things.
But commercial is the one standout area we've got more work to do.
Expenses will certainly help contribute. I mean we still have $800 million to go. You can
expect the bulk of that to fall into P&C, and as we talked about before, that's why there
are only a couple of points on the combined ratio. But overall, from a technical
performance perspective, we do still expect to see improvement from where we are now.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

So just – I'd just quickly follow up on that point. So you think the expense ratios have mix
eﬀects which make it look like it hasn't gone down even though it sort of has. But do you
think that will now start to show a lower ratio going forward?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So I think if you look at the ratio, I mean over the course of the year, you see a reduction
already. I mean, you look at the – I mean the diﬀerent components we got about a 1 point
reduction on expense, 1 point on the accident year loss ratio, and we're about 1 point up
on commissions and the mix change. We're slightly light overall on PYD compared to our
normal expectations. We're in the range, but slightly low in the range, and of course, you
all know why that is, that's because we resolved Ogden over the course of the year.
I mean having said all of that, I do expect to see the expense ratio improve. I mean there
will still be some mix movement, but we're also expecting to see a technical
Page 4 of 24

improvement, so loss ratio improvement, a continuation of what you've seen already on
the accident year loss ratio with a particular focus on commercial.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

On the Life BOP topic, so I mean you asked around the numbers, I think we would be
slightly more cautious on Life, so that means the guidance we're giving today is I think if
you look at the headline number, I don't back out the UK yet, start from the headline
number and anticipate something in the mid-single-digits for growth. That would be our
guidance for Life.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

The next question comes from Nadine van der Meulen from Morgan Stanley. Please go
ahead, madam.

Q - Nadine van der Meulen

{BIO 15200446 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Hello? Can you hear me?

A - Mario Greco

{BIO 1754408 <GO>}

Oh yes, Nadine.

Q - Nadine van der Meulen

{BIO 15200446 <GO>}

Sorry. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. I suppose ﬁrstly on Life, the
new business value, very strong. The margin was particularly up, 23.3%. Can you talk to us
about how sustainable you see that being?
Second question on excess capital, the 132% Z-ECM, Mario just mentioned you're looking
for ways to improve the capital position. I suppose it's not optimal, the 132%, because you
show on slide 37 the target of 100% to 120%, which I mean quickly translating that into
dollars, if you take the midpoint of that, you're talking about a $6 billion, $7 billion excess.
So perhaps, you can elaborate a little bit more on that, what your plans are there and over
what time period?
And then, lastly, on the U.S. commercial side, premiums in large commercial were down.
What should we expect in terms of volume growth going forward? And we've seen rate
increases, competitors have shown similar indications. So what is the outlook in terms of
claims inﬂation there relative to these rate increases? Thank you very much.

FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So I'll start with the new business value. I think if you look at the detailed picture on new
business value, I mean there are one or two items that we would see more one-oﬀ in
nature. So we have a restructure of a large corporate contract in the U.S. But I mean by
and large, I mean the biggest driver of what we see is combination of economic variance.
So the interest rate environment certainly helped us last year. And then, mix, so I mean,
we have an improved mix, particularly in Europe. And that's a combination of I mean
actively selling some of the higher-margin products and in absence of some of the lower
margin, higher volume stuﬀ that we did in 2016 and we talked about it before. So I think
with one exception, I mean most of it is something we would anticipate selling in the
current environment. We can continue to drive.
On the capital topic, so you've seen today that we've announced 132% including the
impacts of the share repurchase for the anti-dilution program. And as you pointed out,
that's still well ahead of our target capital level. I mean, our capital management policy is
completely unchanged. So I mean we'll continue to do the same things you've seen us do
before. Our priority would be growth, and if the growth exists, then that growth can be
either organic or inorganic. And absent that, if we really can't ﬁnd ways to deploy the
capital in the interest of shareholders, we will look to return it. But obviously, we prefer to
ﬁnd the growth if we can.
Mario?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mario Greco

{BIO 1754408 <GO>}

Yeah. On the business, the premiums and the claims, Nadine, so ﬁrst of all, we don't see
much evidence yet of any inﬂation creeping up or developing itself. Claims numbers are
quite stable and frequencies falling down and the cost of the claims is barely positive. So
it's all very quiet from what we've seen so far.
On the premiums side, I mean we see movements in North American property rates
deﬁnitely. The market has alerted all of you on that and we just see that ourselves. We
don't know for how long this will continue, but that deﬁnitely will be through this year.
The growth that we see coming is it comes from two diﬀerent sources. First of all, we are
gaining back in the retention rates. So we're doing much better than in the past years in
renewing with the customers. And the other thing which we've been quite successful
through 2017 that we planned to continue is developing the lines that we're pursuing. So
we have been growing on specialties quite successfully, where we've been growing on
credit lines. So short-tail business has been successfully targeted by us during 2017, and
we will continue growing on these businesses through 2018.
But the message that underwriters have is to grow the proﬁtability, so to go for bottom
line not to go for top line. And we're happy to get to top line moving positively, but the
targets, the priority that the underwriters have is that on the bottom line results of their
lines of businesses.

Q - Nadine van der Meulen

{BIO 15200446 <GO>}

FINAL

Thank you very much. Just a quick follow-up on the growth, as George mentioned, the
growth organic or inorganic, and Mario as you said, you've targeted short-tail lines, is that
sort of the P&C short-tail lines that I should be thinking about when you're talking about
that growth organic or inorganic?

A - Mario Greco

{BIO 1754408 <GO>}

Yeah. I'm really meaning organic growth.

Q - Nadine van der Meulen

{BIO 15200446 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Mario Greco

{BIO 1754408 <GO>}

So what we have been doing since 2016 is to be very clear internally, with our
underwriters, and externally, with the brokers, with the distributors on which portfolios we
would like to go for and also which if any portfolios, we will not like to underwrite.
Consequently, we saw the new businesses started shifting, and we're quite happy with the
composition of new business that we saw coming in through 2017.

Bloomberg Transcript

And by having had already meetings with all the main brokers through January, I can say
that they well understand what we want. They well appreciate what we're after for in 2018.
And I think they would support us in growing in the lines of businesses that we're
targeting.

Q - Nadine van der Meulen

The next question comes from Peter Eliot from Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you very much. The ﬁrst one was just on the sort of the group underlying. I mean
you've given us the underlying BOP. I'm wondering if you could also just share your view
on the underlying net income for 2017 just for us to gauge how the dividend – how the
payout ratio compare to the sort of 75%?
And secondly, on the Life, I take your comments earlier. Just looking at Life Asia Paciﬁc in
particular, BOP was about – was nearly $100 million in H2, a lot stronger than it has been

Page 7 of 24



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG
Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2018-02-08

before. I'm just wondering if you can comment on that speciﬁcally. Were there any oneoﬀs in there, what we should expect there going forward? Thank you.

FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Peter, thank you. So we've worked on quite a few underlying and adjusted numbers, but I
haven't done one on the NIAS. I mean I think if you look at the numbers and you look at
history, I mean I think you can see that, I mean, the realized gain component can be plus
or minus quite a lot depending on what's happening on the asset allocation.
I mean probably the thing that would stand out has been an obvious one-oﬀ and the
results from a NIAS perspective is not involved is the impact of tax reform and the DTA
position that we have. So you maybe got about $219 million. I think trying to normalize
NIAS is really quite diﬃcult given the nature of the thing that drive NIAS. I think we're
trying to take a longer term view. We expect BOP and NIAS to be in line, and typically
NIAS will be slightly higher because of course, there, we pick up I mean the spread
beyond the – or the return beyond the coupon that we achieved within BOP.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the second question on new business value, I mean generally, been a very strong year
for new business value in Asia. We've seen both Japan and Australia perform strongly, I
mean diﬀerent drivers in the two diﬀerent markets. I mean for Australia, it's really growth
of the overall portfolio. That's mainly driven, of course, by the fact that we'd be bringing
on the Macquarie transaction after that acquisition a bit more than a year ago.
On Japan, it's diﬀerent. I mean we went back in the early part of the year to look at, I
mean, how we assess the proﬁtability of some of the products and they rate us and based
on the experience that we've seen, we formed a more positive view. So we've lifted the
view of proﬁtability. I'm not aware of substantial one-oﬀs in Asia Paciﬁc.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Yeah. Just to clarify, it's actually – it was BOP for all the new businesses that I was asking
about there.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So from a BOP perspective, I mean so, for example, on the new business value topic
around Japan, I mean that will have had some small positive impact from BOP that is
more one-oﬀ in nature. I mean that's not a substantial number than the overall Life
performance.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you. And just quickly back perhaps on the ﬁrst point, I mean, I guess I'd sort of
understood that the dividend policy was really driven by your view of underlying net
income. I mean it sounds like this year, it's more a qualitative assessment rather than a
quantitative one on a sort of speciﬁc payout ratio and that the payout ratio will apply more
going forward. Would that be fair?

FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Not quite. I mean so what we did in the conversation we had with the board actually only
yesterday, I mean we built up a model of – I mean it starts from the operating proﬁt and
then runs through to what we think the equivalent NIAS number would be. And we take, I
think, the obvious things that we expect to see in there, so things like impact of
restructuring, the things that we've talked about already and the operating proﬁt, and we
looked at the totality of all of the other movements to try and form a conclusion as to
whether we think there's another item we should exclude or not. And the only signiﬁcant
adjustment that I made to this model NIAS number for the board was to not realize gains
there into a number that's probably more consistent with a longer term expectation than
the ﬁgure that you see in the results today.
So I mean this was not qualitative position. This was a hard decision based on a
combination of what we think we achieved last year, and actually, more importantly, what
we think we're capable of achieving this year.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

The next question comes from James Shuck from Citi. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Thank you. Good afternoon, everybody. I had a few questions please. Firstly, I just wanted
to come back to the loss ratio improvement. So George, you illustrated BOPAT ROE walk,
the famous one, which you update now for 2017 through to 2019. If I compare that what
was given at the time of the Investor Day, there was 0.5 to 1 points of loss ratio
improvement coming through plan by 2019 from the Investor Day, that's now at 50 basis
points from 2017 to 2019. So it's come down a little bit.
I guess when I look at the accident year loss ratio improvement, that actually improved by
1 point over that same timeframe, which is roughly what I would have expected over the
whole planning period. So my question on the loss ratio is, are you running ahead of what
you were planning there? Are there Life losses distorting that number still in any
meaningful way?
Then, secondly, on the ROE target itself, you're kind of gapping away from this 12% BOP
ROE number target, which actually hasn't been changed even though we've had the U.S.
tax reform, and also, you've been deploying capital via acquisitions. You've got 14% target
by 2019, but that increased drag from buildup of equity in particular, which presumably
you'll do something about. So my question really is, is that appropriate target level? I
mean your 14% should presumably be rising as you deploy surplus capital. Is this a
number that's going to come down over time or is it kind of a slow level? How should we
think about the volatility on that going forward?

FINAL

And then, ﬁnally, just a quick one on the eﬃciency side of things. So you're halfway – more
than halfway ahead of the plan by 2019. Anyone can hit an expense ratio target if they put
back on certain discretionary spend. You haven't shed any insights into what your
discretionary spend on digital and data or other initiatives has been, and whether you've
actually been curtailing that in any way, please? Thank you very much.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thank you. Well, I'll try and keep the answer as short as possible. So on the loss ratio
improvement, I think you're great...

A - Mario Greco

{BIO 1754408 <GO>}

Don't be short on the capital targets.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

The ROE target.

A - Mario Greco

{BIO 1754408 <GO>}

Yes.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Okay.

A - Mario Greco

{BIO 1754408 <GO>}

Don't be short on that, please.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

On the loss ratio improvement, I mean I think you're right on the analysis of the
comparison of where we are to what we had put up on the slide back at the end of 2016.
But I mean I think everyone can see from – I mean what I've told you to expect, and then,
what we've actually delivered, we're short against the expectations on the P&C
performance. And we still have work to do there.
So I think the – we're still targeting to get it to 95%, 96%. Expenses are still the biggest
part of that. I mean we have made a lot of improvement. I think maybe more than the
98.2% would necessarily suggest today, but I mean we look at the commercial
performance, I mean we appreciate it's a diﬃcult market. But we want more – we want a
greater return of the capital invested in that business. And Jim Shea and the team are well
aware of that and they're working on it.
On the ROE topic, so I think maybe important point to make is that when we did the –
again, we did the investor presentation back in November of 2016, we said more than
12%, so maybe that's a bit cute but I think we had – we certainly had a 13% written on the

Page 10 of 24

FINAL

slide somewhere. So I think the expectation was that we start slightly over 12% and we
drive it higher over the periods.
We're resisting the temptation simply to revise that target. So I think it's important that we
try and, I mean, maintain the integrity of what we said at the beginning. But I think we can
all see that from a combination of – I mean, with the progress we've made so far, what
we're going to do around the Australian acquisition and, most recently, the impact of U.S.
tax reform that, I mean, simply mathematically that won't make our performance better
than the one that we had planned for.
On the equity drag side of things, so I mean we've left that in the chart. I mean we're
handing back in the form of the dividend and the anti-dilution share repurchase we've a
pretty chunky piece of capital. Last year, we also invested quite a bit, it's important to
remember, by almost $3 billion. I mean let's see what happens there. I mean we want to
use the capital wisely. We don't intend to do anything that is not in the interest of
shareholders. We're under, I mean, no pressure from a performance perspective to do
something at speed. We either ﬁnd a way to use it or we look at returning it. I mean it's
the same policy as before.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the eﬃciency thing, so maybe I take issue that anyone can have an expense target, I
think very few people can have expense target. I mean again, I think if I run you a bit
through the history of what we've done here, I mean we started with the easiest stuﬀ. I
mean discretionary was the ﬁrst thing that Mario asked us to tackle when he arrived back
in February of 2016, just to get a bit of discipline into the organization, a really long path,
(29:21) discretionary.
And in fact, on the technology side of things, I mean a large part of what you see by way
of restructuring last year and you see this unusual thing where we got part of the
restructuring charge is in NIAS, part of it's in BOP and the reason for that is that some of
this is us investing in technology to reduce expenses in 2018 and 2019. So I don't think
we've done anything that is not sustainable around the expense base. In fact, as I look
around the organization, I think we actually operate far more eﬀectively for being lighter
and I think we can take that a bit further still, as we achieve the remainder of the goal. It's
not driven by a starving investment in the digital side, quite the opposite.

deteriorated by nearly 2 points. Could you just clarify where exactly are the problem
books? Is it U.S.? It looks to be partly kind of Europe I think. Is it – a lot of it auto liability,
ﬁnancial lines, D&O, are we talking about a couple of lines of disproportionately high
combined ratios? I appreciate you're still trying to improve it, but I think the degree of
improvement was disappointing in 2017.
Second question, tax, what were the negatives from U.S. tax reform? Are you going to
have to keep more P&C business onshore U.S. and will that aﬀect fungibility, ability to
upstream cash, et cetera? And related to tax, what's the kind of long-term tax rate of the
group going to be? I mean I think part of the reason the group tax rate is still high is
because of weak P&C proﬁtability in Europe. I imagine that was the normalized
underlying for U.S. tax rate, what will the kind of ideal 2019 and onwards tax rate kind of
be for the group?
And the ﬁnal question just a clariﬁcation thing, on the anti-dilution, is that now an ongoing
– I appreciate you're doing some historic catch-up and the next couple of years of options.
But is that now an ongoing commitment as far as employees share options are
concerned?

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you, Andrew. So yeah, I mean we're in charge of it, but I share the
disappointment on the commercial side of it. I think if you look at what drives it, I don't
see that we have new issues. I think we have some of the same concerns that auto
continues to be a problem. I think if you look at it, I mean if you look at the rate entries, it
shows up as the most attractive line of business bar none from a rate perspective. But
unlike retail auto in the U.S., we don't see the change in claim trends that the retail side
has been experiencing. So the improvement there has been far slower than we had
anticipated, and we do intend to take action around how much capital we allocate to that
line of business to drive a more rapid improvement.
I mean besides that, I mean we had issues back in 2016 around ﬁnancial lines. There's still
some of those mainly in Europe in 2017. But I mean the issues overall are not diﬀerent.
We're trying to drive out the necessary return that we have here. So I mean we are
focused on it and do expect we'll improve it.
Mario?

{BIO 1754408 <GO>}

Yeah, can I jump in, because I hear you and I don't disagree on the results. However, I
think I always, always repeated that these are big books, and they don't change one year
from the other. The issue is the book composition. You move it year-after-year, which is
what we're doing, and the books are getting better, and the books are moving in the right
direction, but it takes years. I mean it wasn't as simplistic as there was one chunk which
was underperforming. If you run with a high-90% combined ratio, it is because of book
composition. I mean the Zurich underwriters are not more stupid than the underwriters,
and actually, I think they're skilled and prepared.

FINAL

In order to achieve better combined ratio, we have to compose the books in a diﬀerent
way, which is what we started in 2016, we progressed in 2017, now, we're going to have
the compounded eﬀect of two years, plus the new business of 2018 kicking in on the yearend results of 2018, and this will progress as towards the targets that we announced.
So I wouldn't be that negative although I understand and, of course, I agree on what you
say, but bear the perspective, please, that we are shifting the book composition towards
shorter tail lines, towards diﬀerent – and if you look at the new business development of
2017, that clearly shows it. And this will start producing gradually year-after-year the results
that we're looking for.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

On the tax, so negative from U.S. tax reform, so maybe again just for everyone's beneﬁt, I
mean we clearly have a change in the rates. We have an element of the structural change
which is penal for cross-border transactions. And of course, that's problematic from a
global insurance perspective, because we like to carry risks back to where we have most
of the capital which is back here at home.

Bloomberg Transcript

We took steps as of January 1 to change some of the internal structuring. That means that
we no longer have the same quota share in place from the U.S. or out of the U.S., but that
will slowly build premium volume in the U.S. over time. And of course, we have to carry
capital to support that premium volume.
Not everything is precisely clear at this stage. So with that caveat, I mean at this point, we
would anticipate that, by and large, any negative cash fungibility issues will be ﬁnanced
by the positive cash issues that this thing also generates. So over the next, say, two to
three years, one will ﬁnance the other. And then, once we fully ﬁnance the capability to
hold more of the risk locally, we'll get a pickup in the group's overall cash ﬂow. But in the
short term, one ﬁnances the other.
On the anti-dilution topic, it is our intention that this will be something that we will do
consistently in future.

beyond that.

Right. And the 29%, though, still factored in relatively low proﬁtability of P&C, didn't it?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So I mean you mentioned there's a mix issue in it, but we're seeing more of a contribution
come from, example, from Farmers disproportionately because of what happens
elsewhere, also from Latin America where the rate tends to be much higher. I mean there
will be a shift as we restore proﬁtability in some of the European markets, but the biggest
impact will come from the tax reform.

The next question comes from Thomas Seidl from Bernstein. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Thank you. Good afternoon. First question, back to ROE, slide 9. You show us the new
walk which is, as you say, it shows 1 percentage point higher than the previous one. And I
wonder with the LTIP targets being 9.75% to 14.25% and the cash targets $8.5 billion to $10
billion, is the management of Zurich conﬁdent enough to sign up to higher targets now,
because it strikes me that what you're planning for is exactly in line with the upper end of
the current LTIP targets? That's the ﬁrst question.
Second one, on Farmers, last year, double-digit loss in policies in force was more than
compensated with double-digit rate increases. What do you think is the outlook for
Farmers? Are price increases still setting oﬀ policy losses in 2018 and 2019 or is there a
risk that we see actually shrinking top line of Farmers once the price increases in U.S.
more to ﬂatten oﬀ?
The third one is maybe on Life. You show on slide 20 that, on an underlying basis, you
think that proﬁts are up 22% with investment margin up 16%. Some of your peers have
also reported very strong Life numbers and have said that this was mainly driven by
benign capital markets. So I wonder is $1.4 billion the new run rate of Zurich or would you
also say that there is a $100 million, $200 million from just very benign capital markets in
2017.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thanks, Thomas. So, on the LTIP topic, I mean the point to remember that – well, ﬁrst of all,
we don't set our own targets for LTIP. That's the decision that the board themselves make.
Page 14 of 24



FINAL

Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG
Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2018-02-08

We present the plans to the board and the board decides how they reward the
management. I mean I think we've made it clear already that, I mean, there are things that
as we come forward that we need to work into targets. For example, the acquisition of
ANZ Life business in Australia is something that we said we did, because that would
lessen the targets, but obviously, it doesn't have an immediate impact right now. But I
think, I mean, certainly, over time, given the outlook that we have, I think you would
expect that we would be challenged by the board in this topic, but we don't set those
targets, board does.
On the Farmers side of things, I mean actually, I mean the message we're trying to get
today is actually quite positive. I think if you look at the key metrics around the business,
both from a top line underwriting proﬁtability perspective, even if you look at some of the
leading indicators that the team used to judge, I mean what we could expect to see in the
future, I mean most of them point positively.
We have achieved or I mean the Exchanges here have achieved a very signiﬁcant
improvement in proﬁtability which, as you point out, is a rate-driven. I mean we look
around the market who we think is competing with Farmers in that particular customer
segment. And we think that entire segment of the market is going to continue to push for
further improvement.

Bloomberg Transcript

I mean if you look around selling more some of the mutuals, you will see very substantial
underwriting losses. So we expect next year to see growth in the Farmers business,
together with further improvement in the proﬁtability for the Exchange.
On the Life side of things, I mean I'm not sure I would say, I mean, much more than I said
to the earlier question. I mean where do we see, I mean, the BOP run rate. I would take
the headline number, I'd allow for something like a mid-single-digit growth rate. And
then, to the extent that I mean, if there's anything that was benign or favorable, I mean,
that's incorporated in that guidance.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Okay. Maybe a quick follow-on on Farmers. With the U.S. tax reform, to what extent do
you see Farmers or Farmers' management sets here a price competition as local peers
price in the lower tax rate?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So again, I think you've got – I mean the most important thing here is that we see diﬀerent
segments of the U.S. auto market and, in fact, already – I mean, there are, I mean, very
price competitive segment, price seekers that's how we describe them internally, that are
typically well-served by other providers in the market. So there already is price
competition. I mean this wouldn't really change things substantially.
You then got another segment which, I mean, we talked about and you heard already, I
think, from Jeﬀ, Mike and Roy back in the Investor Day in November what we see, I mean,
price is not unimportant. It's clearly still something that is an important decision driver. But
Page 15 of 24



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG

FINAL

I mean the extent to which service, meeting customer expectations, I mean providing with
all the service they anticipate, I mean that's another very important part of the decision
process.
I think the challenge overall, if you look at the U.S. market, particularly the companies that
serve this particular part of it, is that proﬁtability is still a bit challenged. So therefore, you
can give – you can put a tax kind of in place. But if you're not making enough proﬁt, it
doesn't really change the equation markedly. So I still expect, based on the conversations
I've had with the Farmers team, that we will see more rates to come in this business.

The next question comes from Michael Huttner, JPMorgan. Mr. Huttner, your line is open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Fantastic. Thank you very much. And I was – really well done. What you've done is really
good today. A few questions. So on the Farmers' growth, if I can put it another way, so the
surplus did not change in 2017, $5.5 billion. Given what you were kind of saying in terms
of Farmers' proﬁtability, what could we see there in terms of what is the normal run rate
given your expectations of proﬁtability now? Could the surplus increase by 5% or 10%? I
don't know. Just to get a feel for it. And the reason I asked for that is then we can put you
on the same multiples as (44:36), which would be very nice.
On the cash ﬂow, the $3.7 billion, can you say what the ﬁgure would be if I kind of
normalize for everything? And I've no idea what I should normalize, so I imagine, you've
got hurricanes, I imagine you've got U.S. tax, but these are my imaginations, I'm not 100%,
but the ﬁgure is so high and I expect it to be lower because of nat cat. I'm just wondering
do I add back anything and if I add back the $700 million, it's an amazing ﬁgure.
On the – and then, just really little details. In the one-oﬀs you adjusted for in your lovely
ﬁgures for BOP the $4.7 billion I think it is, what was the adjustment for wildﬁres? And can
you give a ﬁgure for that thing you mentioned a few times, that ﬁnancial reserving, which I
think was Spain, and I suspect it's the thing which drives Europe combined ratio higher. I
can't think of anything else.
That's it. Thank you so much.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thank you, Michael. So on Farmers, I mean, without giving you a precise number, it will
vary depending on the interest rate, I mean, typically, the Exchange is targeting I mean
high-90s combined. They believe that it's somewhere in that range allows them to carry
enough surplus to grow the types of target level that I mean we've seen if you focus on

Page 16 of 24

FINAL

the core operations of Farmers. So they're not looking for 90% combined, they're looking
for something in the 98%, 99% type target.
On the cash ﬂow side, look, so ﬁrst of all, on the cat, so the natural catastrophe, they
actually have quite a small impact on the current year. I mean, maybe, a couple of
hundred million dollars, I mean, really, I mean de minimis. We do have some one-oﬀ.
Quite the most obvious example would be the reinsurance transaction we did around
Sabadell back in the middle of the year that released maybe a couple of hundred million
dollars.
I mean there are a few other small things that are one-oﬀ in nature typically positive or
negative. I mean I think if you normalize that, it would be a bit lower than $3.7 billion, but
it would still be slightly above the run rate required to deliver more than $9.5 billion over
the planning period. But you certainly can't add back the $700 million to the $3.7 billion,
I'd love to do that, but you can't do that.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Just from the $3.7 billion, because you remember, you had this funny – I don't know if it's
funny, but this reallocation of restructuring cost, is the $3.7 billion net of that?

No. So, the...

Q - Michael Huttner

No.

...so restructuring isn't there. So remember when we set the – I won't ask you to remember
– but what I'm trying to say when we set the $9.5 billion target, if you think back, we had
delivered more than $9.5 billion over the prior three-year period. And it was a big
discussion about the quality of that $9.5 billion.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

And your last point is about one-oﬀs. So I mean the challenge here is we could probably
spend a couple of hours in this topic. I could probably have maybe 100 diﬀerent one-oﬀs
all going in diﬀerent directions.
On the cat side, we picked on the hurricanes, because I mean that's really the story where
you take that out and we're roughly where you expect us to be, give or take. And we
picked out the other two obvious things, one which I think people knew about it, one of
which we're announcing today, one being the restructuring and operating, and the other
being the U.K. topic. I mean, there are impacts from wildﬁres, but absent the hurricanes,
there was in expectations.
And there are impacts in the commercial around ﬁnancial lines in Europe. But I think that
topic – I mean only if we take out the good news, but at the end, try and make an
argument, we should take out the bad news. I mean I think the rest of it is awash and the
combined ratio in particular, the number that you've seen is a reasonable representation
of where we are. We need to work to improve it.

The next question comes from Johnny Vo, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

Q - Johnny Vo

{BIO 5509843 <GO>}

Yeah. Hi. Thank you for the questions. Just a quick question on investment income, can
you just comment on the trajectory of that investment income and where we are in terms
of bottoming of that particularly given the rate environment, the moving rate
environment?
And then, secondly, just on deployment of capital, obviously, your IFRS book has moved
up which gives you some ﬂexibility. Z-ECM looks very good and SST looks all good. So in
terms of areas of deployment for M&A, what areas would you look at and would you
necessarily use M&A to accelerate the shift in the P&C book that you're talking about?
Thanks.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks, Johnny. So on the trajectory, two comments for me here. So I mean we
think we're coming into what we expect to be the last year of investment income
compression. If we compare the book yields to the investment yield, we got that 20 basis
point to 30 basis point gap on the P&C book. We're guiding people to assume that we'll
be down beneath this year by about $50 million to $100 million.
On deployment of capital, I mean again, I think the standard disclaimer, ﬁrst of all, I mean
we have no need to do M&A to achieve the targets. And I think it's important to

emphasize that, I mean, all the things that we've talked about in terms of the outlook for
2018, with the exception of the Australian transaction which is now something we're
looking to complete, everything else is organic and everything that's in that walk in the
ROE is organic.
Now, having said that, I mean we clearly have the capability if there's something there that
makes sense. I mean we would like to move the balance of the book, not so easy to do it
given the pricing of some of the assets that you might look to acquire to do that. I think
other priorities would be things like bancassurance. I mean we think we have the core
competence there. We can do more of that. We would certainly deploy capital in support
of it. And then, generally, we've made the point that as we look to simplify the
organization and focus the organization in fewer markets where we have strength, I mean
if we have the ability to put capital behind management teams that are doing a good job
and a market where we can be more relevant, I mean that's obviously a topic that would
also be on the agenda for us.

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Hi, guys. Thanks very much. Three questions if I could. Just still trying to get my head
around the commercial deterioration ex-weather between 2017 and 2016, sorry. I think
you said you were on plan and this was kind of projected to go in the right direction. Is
the problem that you weren't aggressive enough in cutting some of these lines? And
maybe because you had an expense target as well as a loss ratio target, you basically are
now looking at it again and going to cut these lines more aggressively on commercial
auto or I mean is that what's going on here? And are we going to see kind of a reduction
in the top line signiﬁcantly for the commercial business this year?
And then, the second question is on the retail and other line. Could you give the kind of
2016 and 2017 numbers ex RCAS (52:28)? Because I know that on the slide you're saying
ex-catastrophes, and obviously, if RCAS (52:33) had particularly good weather experience
that – have you stripped that out from there or what would that look like excluding that?
And the ﬁnal question is on Farmers. I mean I still don't really get the message that the
forward-looking indicators for Farmers are positive, because the key for new business
looks like it's in – a number, it looks like it's sort of 17% lower than it was two years ago,
which kind of feed through. Are you seeing an increase in the net growth in the agent
count or am I missing something that is obvious in there that is positive? Thank you.

So on the ﬁrst point, if I have said in this call that I thought that commercial was on the
line, I apologize. The team are working hard to improve it, there's plenty more we still
have to do. I don't think it's because we've starved of an investment, or we're trying to
focus on the expense ratio. It's a tough market. There are ratios that aﬀect not only us, but
other members or other market participants. We're now on plan and we look to improve
further, and we expect to see that this year.
On retail/other ex-crop, I mean I have to be honest. It's not a key performance indicator
that we focus on. In fact, I mean when we give you ex-cat numbers, we tend to exclude excat even for crop or cat for crop. So I think if I was going to exclude retail – if I was going
to exclude crop from those out, maybe I'd exclude commercial auto at the same time,
because one is about as far as the other side of the outcome as the other one is the other
way.

Can I – sorry, can I make a clariﬁcation? We don't exclude cats. We only called for not
including in the normal deﬁnition of the run rate of the business the three events in North
America which are very extreme events. That's it. We include everything else. We take
every earthquake, every ﬂood, every storm, everything, whatever in the world.
We just say the three events in America for their brutality and for the fact that they came
all on top of the other in three weeks, they're quite special. And they should be
considered on the side. Everything else is included, will remain included and will always
be included.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

On Farmers, Andy, I think it's safe to say that it's going to take some time before you and I
will see Farmers at the same place. I mean Farmers, I mean I look at the improvements
that we've seen from a proﬁtability perspective. You see it clearly in the combined ratio. I
look at the impact from the top line, and you can choose either the core growth or the allin growth.
And on the indicators, I mean I appreciate that some of them are – maybe the best way to
assume, it's slightly less negative than they were before. But you look at the trends and, in
particular, you get customer satisfaction which we see is a really strong leading indicator
of where the business is headed.
As Mario mentioned in the introduction, I mean we have a very strong performance from
Farmers at the end of the year. So I mean we're happy with what they're doing. We're
happy that you can see evidence of the progress and we expect that to continue.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you. Just one question is that when we see rising interest
rates and, obviously, is there a temptation within the group that some of the portfolio
mixes should probably be diﬀerently done or because ultimately, when the Investor Day
plan was launched, rates were far lower and there's obviously a consideration that rates
would go far higher from here or there's hope there.
So I'm just curious how you look at this dynamic or how your teams look at this dynamic.
And just on the slide 18, again, sorry to ask, just a clariﬁcation. The EMEA movement, is
there some eﬀect of wage inﬂation or those kinds of things, because we have seen wage
inﬂation being a topic even in Europe, of course, becoming a topic? Just want to
understand your view there as well. Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So on the ﬁrst one, on rising interest rates, Vinit, so maybe I start (57:31) talk about stats on
asset risks. So maybe just being through the planning process this summer, I mean,
Urban, our CIO, is recommending no major change on our asset stance. I think, as you
guys know, we had a slightly reduced tax exposure about a year ago, and since then, I
mean we've been broadly consistent. And at this stage, I mean we're not anticipating a
further signiﬁcant shift.
I mean on the interest rate topic in general, I mean that's typically more of an issue that
feeds back into the pricing or the costing mechanisms that we use. So if we did see a
change in the risk-free interest rates, I mean that's something that would certainly update
our view of what the hurdle that had to be achieved would be, but not necessarily a
change in the portfolio mix. So SAA or strategic asset allocation for us anticipated to be
broadly stable.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So I think, so on that, again, I think we've made a strategic choice that we think we're too
overweight on the long tail side of things. I think the interest rate outlook is something
that has fed into that decision already. And the view that that creates around things like
inﬂation risk in the long-term, that's a topic you'll continue to see us where can we take
steps. And already this year, we talked about the fact that reinsurance could be a step in
the right direction here and we have put in place a reinsurance program to shift the mix of
the portfolio. But we also intend to work on the incoming side of the book to emphasize
more of the short-tail lines and trying to achieve a bit more balance and the portfolio
overall.
And then, your last question was about, I mean expense is a big driver of the picture that
you see on 2018 in particular, for example, in Europe and a short summary, unfortunately,
it's no, but mainly driven by loss ratio.

Right. And that's also motor, as you mentioned in the call already or something else?

So I mean, motor, it has to be a tough market pretty much everywhere. It certainly
contributes to, but I mean a larger contributor in 2017 will be ﬁnancial license, for
example.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

In EMEA, okay.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

You're right.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

All right. Thank you, George.

The next question comes from Dhruv Gahlaut, HSBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Dhruv Gahlaut

{BIO 16209870 <GO>}

Yeah. Hi. Good afternoon. Just two questions. One, could you update in terms of
reinsurance program if that's changed? And secondly, on the SST framework, you seem to
point out to the reserve risk change, which has led to the ratio coming down by about 10
points. Could you say a bit more in terms of where it's coming Life, non-Life, what has
changed here? Thanks.

FINAL

Yeah. Thanks, Dhruv. So on the reinsurance program, I think the only piece of substance
that we renew, on the cat side, is the global aggregate cat. I mean no major changes in
structure. Pricing is slightly up, as you would expect, I think given the market conditions.
On the comment on the SST slide, so that was really to reﬂect the process in contrary with
FINMA as they review proposed models and either approve or either ask for changes. I
mean we have one issue where they've indicated that they would still want to see change
before they'd be satisﬁed with it. That's reserve risk on the P&C book. I mean we've
estimated the impact that we anticipate from that. And as you can see, I mean overall, at
this stage, we still expect the SST ratio when we publish it in April, I mean to be above
200% and that's a very comfortable position for us to be in. But that comment really
reﬂects the ongoing conversation with FINMA and their expectations around how this
should be modeled.

Q - Dhruv Gahlaut

{BIO 16209870 <GO>}

Right. Perfect.

The last question for today comes from Ralph Hebgen, KBW. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Yes. Hi, guys. Ralph Hebgen from KBW. I just have one question which is left and that
relates to cash gain on slide 34. I just still like to get a better handle if possible on the
components of the cash which you show. So ﬁrst, George, you've mentioned a few oneoﬀs, but in particular, in Life, I mean Life is very strong with $1.1 billion shown here on slide.
And I remember that your sort of guidance was to expect about $500 million or so from
cash on an annual basis. So that is my ﬁrst comment on the cash.
And the second one is I pick up that you're saying that the nat cats, of the nat cats, there's
only about perhaps $200 million or so in this. So if it is the case, that only $200 million of
the claims which you've received are cash eﬀective this calendar year, is it therefore a fair
conclusion to say that $500 million of cash negative impact will come in to this calendar
year?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So it's very nearly on the second one. So the only thing I left out was (1:03:06) tax. So we
look at the post tax loss of maybe around $600 million, so maybe another $400 million of
impact from cat to come in the dividends that the businesses declare after the year end.
On the ﬁrst one, I mean, obviously, one of the things that has changed since the point at
which we gave the guidance around the $500 million – gave $500 million per annum, I
mean a large part of the Life business is European based. Solvency II just make a
diﬀerence to the expected cash ﬂow and so that certainly helps. And of course, the one-

oﬀ that I mentioned in response to Michael's question around Sabadell is also setting in
the Life number.

FINAL

Okay. That's cool. Thank you very much.

A - Richard Burden

{BIO 1809244 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much, everybody, for dialing in today. And we're aware that there
are a number of outstanding questions from the call and we will try and get back to
everybody. The IR team is available all afternoon for further questions. So thank you very
much and good-bye.
