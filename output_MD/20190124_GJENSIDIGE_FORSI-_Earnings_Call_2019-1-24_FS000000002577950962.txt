Good day and welcome to the Gjensidige Quarter Four 2018 Results Presentation. Today's
conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms.
Mitra Negård, Head of IR. Please go ahead, ma'am.

Mitra Hagen Negård
Thank you very much. Good morning and welcome to the fourth quarter and full-year
presentation of Gjensidige. My name is Mitra Negård, and I'm Head of Investor Relations.
As always, we will start with our CEO, Helge Leiro Baastad, who will go through the
highlights, followed by our CFO, Jostein Amdal, who will run through the numbers in
further detail. And we will have plenty of time for questions at the end. Helge, please.

Thank you, Mitra. Good morning and welcome, everyone. 2018 was indeed an
extraordinary year for Gjensidige with extreme weather impacts hitting our earnings for
the ﬁrst three quarters. The fourth quarter was a more normal quarter from a weather
perspective.
Starting with a few comments on our fourth quarter results on page 2. We generated a
proﬁt before tax of almost NOK 1.7 billion. The group's underwriting result for the quarter

amounted to NOK 1.9 billion corresponding to a combined ratio of 68.5%. We released
run-oﬀ gains of NOK 1.4 billion in the fourth quarter, signiﬁcantly more than we had
planned for earlier following an in-depth review of our claims reserves. Adjusted for this,
the combined ratio for the quarter was 91.3%, down from 95.7% year-over-year.
The improvement was a result of premium growth and a more favorable underlying
proﬁtability, particularly for motor in Norway, mainly as a consequence of more benign
weather conditions compared with the fourth quarter 2017. Our operation outside Norway
continued to show good progress and our strong cost discipline resulted in a decline in
the cost ratio. Market turmoil resulted in negative returns of NOK 231 million on our
investment portfolio. Jostein will work (00:02:37) with more detailed comments on the
results.
Turning to page 3 and looking at the year as a whole, we reported a pre-tax proﬁt of NOK
4.3 billion. We are not satisﬁed with the underlying results we have delivered in 2018,
even when adjusting for the extraordinary weather eﬀects last year hitting us with
somewhere between NOK 530 million and NOK 660 million through the ﬁrst nine
months. Hence, ﬁrst and foremost, our focus is on getting our Norwegian business back
on track. I will revert shortly to this.

But ﬁrst, let's look at our dividend proposal on the next page. Based on the full year
results, our board has proposed a dividend of NOK 3.55 billion corresponding to NOK
7.10 per share. This is in line with dividend payout last year despite lower proﬁts
conﬁrming our commitment of delivering high and stable nominal dividends to our
shareholders.
For our customers, this again bodes for distribution of a solid customer dividend from the
Gjensidige Foundation. The proposal corresponds to a payout ratio of 95.5% on the
group level. For Gjensidige Forsikring ASA, the proposal corresponds to a payout ratio of
117%. A proposal on ASA level above 100% requires approval from the Norwegian FSA.
Based on the strong capital position for both the group and the parent company, we
expect the application to be approved.
Then turning to page 5, I would like to elaborate on the operational status in a few key
areas. After several quarters of disciplined and focused eﬀorts, we are very pleased to see
that underlying proﬁtability for our motor product in Norway is on its way to reach a
turning point during the ﬁrst half this year as expected. We have put through signiﬁcant
price increases and adjusted terms reﬂecting the inﬂation which have so clearly been
impacted by the structural changes in the Norwegian vehicle ﬂeet. So far, we see very
limited change in churn levels in motor and most of the customers we lose are still the
least attractive ones, meaning overall portfolio quality is gradually improving.
Looking at our overall retention numbers for private and commercial, they have actually
strengthened during this quarter. By year-end, we had 90% retention in the private
segment and 92% in the commercial segment. We are continuing with signiﬁcant price
increases into 2019 and are prepared to see high churn going forward, and we can live
with that. However, we will monitor the development closely, aiming at striking the

Page 2 of 16

FINAL

optimal balance between proﬁtability and volume. Competition is still ﬁerce and our
pricing initiatives make new sales more challenging. However, we see signs that
competitors start following with price increases and we expect them to step this up during
the next quarters, reﬂecting the underlying claims inﬂation for motor in the Norwegian
market.
Our operational outside Norway continue to develop according to plan, and we are
conﬁdent in our ambition that these operations will contribute NOK 750 million ex run-oﬀ
to our underwriting result in 2022. Overall for the commercial lines, we are satisﬁed with
renewals so far across all segments. In order to remain competitive, we need to continue
lowering our cost structure and increase eﬃciency and utilization of best practice.
Automation of tariﬀs and the new core IT system are important catalysts for improved
eﬃciency and future proﬁtability. And we are moving forward with increasing digital
interaction with our customers. It is all about simpliﬁcation for the beneﬁt of our
customers and for ourselves.
We are in the ﬁnal phase of closing the sale of Gjensidige Bank to Nordea and expect to
complete the process during this quarter. We have spent the past months laying the
ground for a strong and eﬀective strategic partnership. We look very much forward to
embark on this journey together with Nordea.
And with that, l will leave the word to Jostein to present the Q4 results in more detail.

Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Thank you, Helge, and good morning, everybody. I will start on page 7. We delivered a
proﬁt before tax of NOK 1.7 billion in the fourth quarter. As a reminder, the bank's results
are recorded as discontinued operations and, hence, not included in this table. The
increase in proﬁts over Q4 last year was driven by the underwriting result rising to NOK 1.9
billion. This was, to a large extent, driven by NOK 1.4 billion in run-oﬀ gains.
Our updated reserve reviews revealed NOK 1.1 billion higher excess claims reserves than
previously anticipated. These excess reserves are related to personal injury in connection
with workers' compensation and motor TPL in Norway, and still applies mainly to the
vintages 2008 to 2014. This increase in excess reserves was now released in its entirety in
Q4.
The excess reserves of approximately NOK 4 billion (00:09:06) still remains and we stick
to plan to release these over the next four years, NOK 1 billion per year. The underwriting
result was also driven by somewhat lower large losses and improved underlying
proﬁtability for operations both in Norway and outside Norway.
Turning to page 8, earned premiums were up 1.9% and 2.2% adjusted for currency eﬀects.
We continued putting signiﬁcant price increases in Norway in particular for motor and
private property and larger accounts in the commercial sector. We see the result of this
with 5% premium growth for the private segment and almost 7% for the commercial
segment.

FINAL

Our operations outside Norway remain dedicated to improve the quality of our portfolios
for better risk selection and considerable pricing measures. This has a temporary negative
impact on the top line, but we are convinced that we need to establish healthy portfolios
in our operations outside Norway before shifting our focus to growth. Having said that, we
believe we are reaching that point in near future, especially for the Baltics.
Turning over to page 9, the loss ratio decreased by 21 percentage points to 53.8%.
Majority of this is related to a signiﬁcant increase in run-oﬀ gains recorded in the quarter.
However, it is also important to point out that underlying proﬁtability improved. The
weather conditions in Q4 2017 drove up losses for motor in Norway. And this year, with a
more benign Q4 weather-wise, we saw claims coming down. We've seen the positive
eﬀect of our pricing measures starting to come through. This in combination with other
measures such as increased retention levels make us conﬁdent that the underlying loss
ratio for private and motor in Norway will reach a turning point during the ﬁrst half of
2019.
We also recorded lower frequency claims in Denmark and the Baltics in Q4, proving
eﬀective pricing and pruning measures. And we will continue pursuing optimal risk
selection and pricing in order to further improve proﬁtability.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let's now turn to page 10. We recorded NOK 898 million operating expenses in the
quarter, corresponding to a cost ratio of 14.8% or 14.1% excluding the Baltics. Both are
down 1 percentage point from Q4 last year. The improvement is a result of continued cost
discipline across the whole group and our focus on simpliﬁcation of processes,
automation of internal operations, and further digitization.
A few comments on our pension and bank operations on slide 11. Our pension business
posted yet another quarter of good results with a proﬁt before tax of NOK 56 million and
15.8% return on equity for the year as a whole. The rise in proﬁt from last year was to a
large extent driven by strengthening of IBNR reserves in Q4 2017, but also strong
insurance risk results for fully paid policies due to the completion of the buildup of the
longevity reserves in the portfolio.
But the consistent high proﬁtability level in 2018 is mainly due to continued growth in our
customer base, strong operational performance, and high returns from property
investments. Assets under management decreased somewhat towards the end of the year
reﬂecting the market turmoil. By year-end last year, as much as 70% of the customers in
our pension business were general insurance customers as well. Looking at the other way,
around one-third of our SME non-life insurance customers, with a health and accident
coverage also have their pension arrangement with us. This proves both the beneﬁts of
cross-selling and the potential for more growth within pensions.
The bank reported a pre-tax proﬁt of NOK 15 million in the fourth quarter. The decline
compared with Q4 2017 was due to several nonrecurring items: higher operating
expenses following growth (00:12:51), lower lending margins and losses on ﬁnancial
instruments.

Moving on to investment portfolio on page 12, the investment portfolio of NOK 53 billion
yielded a negative return of 0.4% in the quarter, reﬂecting signiﬁcant market turmoil. The
match portfolio yielded a positive return of 0.1% on the portfolio of NOK 34.5 billion. A
large part of the match portfolio consists of bonds that amortize costs, which yield a return
of 1.0%. The running yield in this portfolio was 3.8% and at the end of the quarter – and
the average reinvestment rate for 2018 was close to 3.3%. Unrealized excess value
amounted to approximately NOK 0.8 billion. The relatively low yield in the match portfolio
in the quarter reﬂects the negative eﬀect of spread widening in the part of this portfolio
that's not booked at amortized costs.
The free portfolio, which amounts to NOK 18 billion, yielded a negative return of 1.5% in
the quarter. Credit spread widening and decline in value of equities contributed
negatively to the result, whereas properties, private equity and government bonds
contributed positively in the quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now looking at capital position on page 13. Our capital position is still strong. Our
approved internal model gives us Solvency margin of 169%, while our own partial internal
model gives us a Solvency margin of 190%. This is well within our target range. The
Solvency margin is somewhat lower than that we had at the end of Q3, reﬂecting several
factors. Q4 proﬁts made a positive contribution to own funds. However, this was oﬀset by
dividend adjustments to reﬂect the actual proposed dividend.
Own funds were negatively impacted by implementation of the new tax rules on deferred
tax related to the security provision. The Solvency capital requirement increased following
implementation of the remaining FSA requirements regarding the approved internal
model. All these factors came in in line with our earlier communication on what to be
expected at year-end. The Solvency capital requirement was further impacted by reduced
market risk in investment portfolio towards the end of the year, reﬂecting our lower
exposure towards equities and credit risk. The pro-forma Solvency margin given the sale
of Gjensidige Bank is calculated to 245% as of the year-end 2018.
I'll then hand the word back to Helge for some concluding remarks.

Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

To sum up on page 14, standing at the very beginning of 2019, I'm very optimistic about
Gjensidige's prospects. I'm conﬁdent of the signiﬁcant probability measures across the
whole operation of feeding through and I'm conﬁdent we will deliver on our ambitious
targets presented at our Capital Markets Day in November last year.
We expect our organic growth to be in line with nominal GDP growth over time.
Continued eﬀorts to maintain and further strengthen our unique position in the
Norwegian market is on top of our agenda. We will continue with signiﬁcant proﬁtability
measures in motor to counter the impact from the expected claims inﬂation.
Proﬁtability is still expected to reach a turning point during the ﬁrst half of 2019. In
general, our pricing is based on extensive analytical insight. And we are moving towards

tariﬀ automation for more dynamic risk pricing. This ﬁeld represent a game changer as for
our ability to react on market dynamics and improve proﬁtability.
Further, we will continue our eﬀorts to deliver the best digital customer experiences in the
Nordic and Baltic general insurance industry. We will continue to see proﬁtable growth
through a disciplined acquisition strategy, reaping the beneﬁts of economies of scale and
transferring the best practice across the group. We are ﬁrmly committed to deliver
attractive returns to our shareholders.
After closing the bank sale this quarter, we will give ourselves some time to explore
diﬀerent M&A opportunities in our marketplace. Hence, we do not plan for paying out any
special dividends during 2019. However, I can promise you, we will stay disciplined and
rational and return excess capital to our shareholders over time, if opportunities do not
(00:17:17) arise.
And with that, we will now open for the Q&A session. Thank you.

Thank you. We will take our ﬁrst question from Jonny Urwin of UBS. Please go ahead. Your
line is open.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Hi. Morning. Thanks. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two, please. So, ﬁrstly, the
underlying improvement in the loss ratio came through a bit sooner than expected which
is good to see. And I note in the presentation that you talk about weather being a partial
driver. I know it's always hard to isolate the weather impacts from the underlying
movements, but I'm just trying to get a sense for how much was true underlying and how
much was weather just given it's a bit sooner than expected?
And then on the reserve releases, isn't there a risk here that when we released the good
news from the strong underwriting years in 2008 to 2014, isn't that a bit risky given the
most recent underwriting years have been a bit weaker from a proﬁtability perspective?
And it's often a trend and actuaries always say this, but the good underwriting years tend
to get better from a reserving perspective and the bad underwriting years tend to get
worse. So any comments there would be great. Thank you.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

I can give you a comment on the ﬁrst question and Jostein are preparing the second one.
You're actually asking if you see a turning point of proﬁtability in fourth quarter, especially
for motor. Proﬁtability for motor Norway improved in fourth quarter 2018 compared to
2017 after several quarters of lower year-on-year proﬁtability as commented. And the
improvement is partly due to more favorable weather conditions in fourth quarter 2018.
And it's too early to conclude on an underlying improvement as there are always random
Page 6 of 16

variations in insurance from quarter-to-quarter. But what I can say, we are very
encouraged by the results and feel conﬁdent that we will see a turning point during the
ﬁrst half of 2019.

FINAL

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

On the reserves, I mean even though loss ratio very higher in the last – say from second
half of 2016 somewhat, loss ratios haven't been really high. And I feel very conﬁdent really
that we have suﬃcient reserves on these past vintages and don't see any special risk of
future negative run-oﬀs on these years.
Remember that the releases (00:20:31) from very long tail lines of business, workers'
comp and motor TPL. And it's not those lines of business that have been especially hit in
2017 and 2018. So I'm not too worried about that.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Fair enough. Great color. Thanks, guys. Thank you.

We will take our next question from Matti Ahokas of Danske Bank. Please go ahead. Your
line is open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. Two questions. It sounds like the weather in Q4 was a bit better than
kind of a normal Q4. Is it possible to quantify this? You obviously gave the negative
weather impact in the previous quarters. And then regarding the sale of the bank, how
will this impact the diversiﬁcation beneﬁts in your capital calculation? Thanks.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Hi. We don't have a speciﬁc number for how bad was Q4 2017. Q4 2018 is not far from
normal, maybe slightly benign but not – yeah, but not very. Q4 2017, we said, but without
quantifying that we were hit by winter eﬀects in Q4 2017, especially on the motor side. So
I'm sorry I can't give you any precise number. But if you kind of take away the run-oﬀs and
look at the remaining improvements, I would say that's partly due to more benign weather
than Q4 2017, partly due to a real underlying improvement in proﬁtability. Sorry for not
being more precise.
On the bank, there is no diversiﬁcation beneﬁt at all in the capital calculation from bank
and insurance.

Q - Matti Ahokas

comes from Blair Stewart of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

FINAL

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Hello. Good morning. I've got a couple of questions. Helge, when you talk about the
turnaround happening in the ﬁrst half of the year, how should we think about quantifying
that in terms of the impact on the combined ratio? If you can give us some color there.
Secondly, just with regards – just remind me on the calculation of the Solvency. Do you
accrue the dividend all the way through the year, or is that just the Q4 eﬀect? And on that
as well, what was the additional NOK 1 billion of excess reserves? Was that, in any way,
included in the Solvency position or has that provided a boost? Thank you.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Hi, Blair. By turning point, we mean an improvement in underlying proﬁtability year
on year. That's the turning point. It's important to also mention that motor is and will still
be an very important insurance plan for us. And as you know, we came from extreme
proﬁtable situation with years with very benign weather situation. And it has weakened
from the very strong proﬁtability levels we had over several years, which, as I said, was to
a large extent driven by the benign weather situation in our region.
We will continue with our pricing measures this year aiming for a gradual improvement
after this turning point. Whether we will ever reach historical peaks, it's diﬃcult to predict,
but we will certainly do our best to improve proﬁtability from that turning point. So, once
again, it's the underlying proﬁtability improvement year over year.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

For the Solvency calculation throughout the year, we assume a 70% dividend as a
percentage of IFRS proﬁt because that, until now, is the minimum average and will
increase to 80% going forward. So, not to speculate in what the actual dividend will be,
this is just a matter calculation.
And then when we come to the fourth quarter, we take the actual proposed dividend
then. And since payout ratios have been higher than 70% the last years, then there is a
drop in Solvency for that reason every fourth quarter. And that's something we're going to
try to be clear about in our communication throughout the year. So 70% of proﬁts after Q3
was less than the NOK 3.55 billion that we now propose or the board has proposed.
On the extra NOK 1 billion reserve releases, it's important to distinguish that by
recognizing that there is an extra NOK 1 billion of potential reserve releases that has a
positive eﬀect on the Solvency margin because we use best estimates for reserves in the
Solvency calculation. But taking it to the P&L has no special eﬀect on the Solvency margin.
That's indiﬀerent there. So, the NOK 1 billion wasn't in any way necessary to boost
Solvency margins to manage the dividends or anything. It has no relation to that.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

FINAL

Understood. That's very clear. Just to come back on the ﬁrst question, perhaps it might be
useful to have a view on to what extent price increases that you're managing to
implement are above the inﬂation level. That might be a good guide for us. So are the
price increases exceeding the claims inﬂation level in motor?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Yeah. Talking about – to start with our expectation for – just to give a comment on
expected claims inﬂation going forward ﬁrst. So, our expectation is unchanged and, if
anything, tilting a bit down to around 5% to 6%. And remember, however, that this reﬂects
our expected increase in risk premium, meaning a combination of frequency, repair costs,
and portfolio mix eﬀects. And we have talked about the latter several times regarding new
cars, EV and hybrids in Norway.
When it comes to price increases, fourth quarter and into 2019, we are signiﬁcant above
that level. And I commented churn, the retention is unchanged. We see gradually
somewhat more challenging new sales. That's natural. But, overall, we are very conﬁdent
into 2019.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

The price increases don't look signiﬁcantly above that level, Helge. They're between 5%
and 7%, so they're really above but not signiﬁcantly above, would that be fair?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Please also remember the earnings eﬀect of these price increases since 24 months. We're
talking about price increases that will hit new policies and that then takes time both for
the policies to renew and the earning into the accounts.

Many thanks. Just a point of administration. Could you let us know how quickly the FSA
are likely to approve the dividend payout? And secondly, on the dividend, given that

On the ﬁrst one, to be fair I don't really know how fast, but based on our previous
communication with FSA, we are very conﬁdent that we will get this approval, but how fast
this will actually happen, it's hard for us to be very concrete on that. Yeah, actually

On the second, our dividend policy remains is that we strive to keep a high and normal
and stable dividend and if we have growth in underlying proﬁts then dividends – or their
dividends should also grow. We do have a fairly solid Solvency margin both before and
after this dividend, partly also to meet volatile results and keep dividend at the same level
or increasing.
Looking forward, of course, we do have one-oﬀs (00:30:41) that we talked about in 2018.
We have weather eﬀects to the tune of NOK 500 million, NOK 600 million and we have
unusually negative investment return especially in the fourth quarter if you look at an
investment return for the (00:30:54) it's low. It's a little bit kind of normalized

Yeah. Good morning. It's Jan Erik from ABG. I have four questions. The ﬁrst one is about
price versus new wins in commercial. You have a quite steep growth in commercial
premiums, so how much is really price increases versus new business wins during the year
and how is the outlook for the 1st of January and onwards?
Secondly, you talk about not being afraid for churn. After looking into it, it might be that
you're also getting rid of your proﬁtable customers with your sort of heavy price increases.
What is your (00:32:05) or how would you deal with that going forward when you see the
proﬁtable customers also leaving you?
The third one is the negative frequency in commercial. Could you shed some light to that
because you talked about the positive frequency in private? And, ﬁnally, just very fast on
the bank, what kind of margin has been coming down and which product? Thank you.

It's large questions, all of them, Jan Erik, and I can start and Jostein, please ﬁll me out.
Regarding commercial, we have actually last, I would say, during 2015, 2016, and 2017 had
– remember, we have 80% is direct distribution. It's SMEs. It's large motor book also in the
commercial. And, of course, we have had a soft market for a period. Our volume in 2018
has been stable to positive. So the majority of what you can see here is price increases.
And you have also seen comments from other of our peers regarding the commercial. So
it's a diﬀerent type of market we're operating in now into 2019 compared to what we saw
one year ago.
When it's about churn, I read your paper last week and I wouldn't say that we are...

...afraid of that many thing. We are not that afraid of that many things. But of course, we
are conscious regarding churn for new sales. And of course, we are monitoring A, B, C
and D customers. And A and B customers, we want to keep the broad customers. But
what I said previously is that, looking forward if anything, regarding what we had deﬁned
as claims inﬂation which is a broad – it's several things. It's more increase in risk premium.
We – if anything, we see tilting a bit down. So we can act, I would say, smart and we can
act proactively to retain our broad proﬁtable customers.
What I said so far, we have more or less – we have had problems on the churn side for the
C and D customers slightly during fourth quarter. We haven't seen anything regarding our
present customers. But forward, of course, we have to monitor this closely and we have to
keep and try to retain our broad proﬁtable customers.
Commercial, the third, and the bank, maybe you could comment on the third and the
fourth questions.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Yes, Helge. On the negative frequency in the commercial sector, you see that we have a
small negative development in the underlying losses or underlying results in the
commercial (00:35:34) particular line of business that has been hit. But it's mostly related
to property and motor, but no speciﬁc ﬂavor I can give to that. It is part of just the ordinary
short-term volatility in that and that we are looking to mitigate through price and other
measures. Similar problems in the motor line as we have...

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Just a question. On the motor side, it's a little odd that if you have a sort of improved
weather situation on the private side in motor, while we have a negative observation on
that same kind of frequency on the commercial side.

FINAL

It is slightly diﬀerent that – in the pricing environment tends to be a bit diﬀerent and motor
in commercial also includes more heavy trucks, car ﬂeets, and so on which are diﬀerent
than the private. And on the property side, there's been several smaller losses that has
been kind of contributed to this negative frequency.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

The bank, which products have lower margins, what's really hitting the bank in the fourth
quarter has been a lot of one-oﬀs, but we also have some lower underlying margin in the
ordinary mortgage book. Funding costs have increased and we've delayed some of the
price increases out to the customers, but they have been put through now.
We were hit by, what I would say, a conservative approach to meeting the
recommendations that's now turning into requirements from the FSA in terms of how to
market consumer loans, which has meant that we had to use kind of more costly
marketing channels than we used to before because we haven't been that competitive
with the brokers, and also that we also had to keep a big lid on the interest rate of the
customers in the consumer loan sector. Yeah, I think that's the broad story.

Our next question comes from Paul Walsh of Field Gibson Media. Please go ahead.

Q - Paul Walsh

{BIO 3076077 <GO>}

Good morning. Just a couple of questions if you don't mind, please. I remember during
your Capital Markets Day in London at the back end of last year, you talked about a target
of increased claims reporting to be done digitally. Could just give me an update on that,
please, in terms of how many policies are being handled digitally? And also, if you could
possibly give me an update on IFRS 17 preparations, please.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

I'll start on the IFRS 17, while we're struggling to ﬁnd the ﬁgure on the digitalization here.
IFRS 17, we expected to start in or to be implemented by 1/1/2022. And we are well under
way to implement these new accounting regulations. It will have a fairly limited impact on
the non-life side since you can choose a simpliﬁed method because you have the 12month policies, whereas there will be a more heavy impact on our pension business and
the life insurance sector in total.

In terms of implementing costs, there is nothing like a Solvency II project or anything like
that. It's fairly limited implementation costs. Yeah, I think that's enough for now. It's a
project that (00:39:35) extremely concerned about the eﬀects of that project.

FINAL

On the updated numbers on the digitalization of claims handling, we are at 69.6% of
frequency claims in the private segment in Norway that's applied online as of Q4 2018.
And then I don't have a combined ﬁgure for the other geographies, but it's increasing.

Q - Paul Walsh

{BIO 3076077 <GO>}

Good. So, just to conﬁrm, it was 69.6% in the private segment.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Yeah, in Norway.

Our next question comes from Vinit Malhotra of Mediobanca. Please go ahead. Your line
is open.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you for letting me come back into this call. Sorry about the technical hassle.
Maybe a few follow-ups, please. Just on the Solvency and the reserving topic, please. If
you could clarify, so when the FSA had approved the excess reserves in Q3, is it a safe
assumption that this NOK 1 billion or NOK 1.4 billion depending – this amount was not
included in that Solvency or was it included? If you could just clarify because, from the
regulators' point of view, it might be a bit of surprise that they've just probably reviewed

Page 13 of 16

FINAL

your reserves and allowed you to add them in. And now, there is suddenly such a large
amount of new reserves coming in, so that is on the Solvency topic.
Then just on Denmark, it seems that the kind of re-underwriting is sort of stabilizing
because the – I mean, I'm reading a report that in the fourth quarter, there's just NOK 1
million lower local currency premiums. Is it reﬂecting that you're a bit more positive about
Denmark, particularly commercial, or is it just a coincidence that this quarter was sort of
ﬂattish? That's the second question, please.
And last question, just probably follow-up because I missed some of the things. In the
bank, is it just, again, maybe by chance that since the sale was announced, the proﬁt that
are being reported are quite lower? I mean, is there a chance that there could be some
conversation that, hey, what's happening here, is there something else – I mean, is there
any conversation with Nordea on the price or anything else that you think is worth
ﬂagging because it's quite noticeable that the bank used to be sort of always a very
strong proﬁt level and it's coming down a bit since the sale announcement? Thank you
very much.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Okay. On the ﬁrst one, the FSA – what the FSA are approved and/or said to us that was
when they identify a margin in the claims reserve that should be included in the Solvency
margin calculation. They didn't approve the numbers or anything like that as such. So, this
extra NOK 1 billion that you're talking about now is something that come through the
fourth quarter reserve release and not been part of any dialog with the FSA. But the size
of this claims – well, the margin in the claims reserves, we haven't been in any dialog with
the FSA about. It's just the principle of how you calculate the Solvency margin.
On the Danish business, it's true that we have going through a re-pricing exercise over –
say started in 2017 gradually means that we are getting closer to the proﬁtability level
where we are supposed to be. It's not quite there yet, but we're getting there gradually.
That helps in the competitive situation, but still we think we'll capture more of the growth
when we are at the right proﬁtability level and don't have the same need to go through
these pricing and pruning measures.
On the bank, various eﬀects I'd say that's contributed to the lower results in the fourth
quarter. There are costs related to the separation of the bank. It's not just costing to get
business. It's also costing to segregate them from the existing operations in terms of IT
and others that we need to do that weighed somewhat on the results.
And as we talked about in the previous question with ABG that there is also margin
pressure on some of the products. So it's a diﬀerent set of factors that contribute to the
lower results. There's no dialogue with Nordea regarding these results. They'll take over
from the formal closing some time during Q1. And beyond that, the proﬁt or lack of proﬁt
is our risk and not theirs.

FINAL

And sorry, if I can follow up please. I think Helge mentioned that claims inﬂation, the
expected levels were sort of unchanged, but still a bit better at 5% to 6% instead of 6%
before. Is that because of something in the market? Is it because of better behavior by
competitors? Is it just some trends you are observing? Could you just comment a bit
about why that 5% to 6% versus 6% before, please?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Yeah. As I said, it's – expectation is unchanged actually. But...

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Unchanged, okay.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

...if anything, it's tilting a bit down to around 5% to 6% and we communicated 6% during
the Capital Markets Day. And I also commented I think that's important to maybe repeat
that we are talking about increase in risk premium. And when the competitors and the
market talk about claims inﬂation, it means maybe diﬀerent thing.
When we talk about what 5% to 6%, that's increase in risk premium and that's a
combination of frequency. And frequency is slightly increasing due to the change in the
bonus system last years. But we are doing lots of measures to handle that. It's also repair
cost, average increase in the repair cost. And ﬁnally, it's a portfolio mix eﬀects. And of
course, when you have the proper and right tariﬀs, you are dealing with the new cars, of
course, going forward. But we see that combination of average increasing in claim repair
cost, frequency development and portfolio mix. That adds up to 5% to 6%. And I
commented also that other price increases has been in average above that last quarter
and into 2019. And that gives just opportunities going forward.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Vinit, I'm just getting back to your Denmark question. I think maybe to clarify one thing if I
understood you correctly that there was NOK 1 million lower premiums in local currency.
It's the decrease, which is NOK 1 million lower when measured in local currency. So, if you
have approximately NOK 30 million in Norwegian kroner, it will be NOK 29 million
measured in local currency.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Okay. Sorry. I misread it quickly. Thank you.
