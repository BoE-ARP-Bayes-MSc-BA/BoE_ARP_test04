{BIO 20060140 <GO>}

Yes. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Storebrand's third quarter 2016
conference call. My name is Kjetil Ramberg Krokje, and I'm Head of Investor Relations at
Storebrand. Together with me today, I have Group CEO, Odd Arild Grefstad; CFO, Lars
Loddesol; Finance Director, Sigbjorn Birkeland; and Head of Economic Capital, Trond
Finn Eriksen.
In the presentation today, Odd Arild will give an overall view of the development in Q3
2016, and Lars will give some more detail on some elements in the results and solvency.
The slides will be similar to the analyst presentation released this morning, and are
available on our web page. After the presentation, the operator will open up for
questions. To be able to ask questions, you will need to dial into the conference call.

Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Thank you, Kjetil. The Group result before amortization and write-downs was NOK690
million for the quarter. This is a very strong result, which is aﬀected by good ﬁnancial
results and reduced costs. Even though, we have set aside for ongoing restructuring in
the quarter.
The growth within savings and insurance continues, while the guaranteed products are in
run-oﬀ. This is illustrated by the premium growth of 18% year-to-date within unit linked
and a growth of 28% within retail loans. Insurance premiums grow 6% compared to third
quarter last year. The transformation of the business becomes clear when we see that the
guaranteed income is reduced by 6% at the same time.
Good results and strong buﬀer building has contributed to a 9% point growth in the
underlying solvency position to 131%. The solvency position including transitional rules is
reduced because we have taken a more conservative approach and reduced the value of
the transition with tax.

Bloomberg Transcript

If you move to slide number three, we see that the results of the third quarter reﬂects our
dual strategy, which really is the reason why Storebrand is an attractive investment.
Three elements, the value creation becomes -- comes through strong cost control, with a
nominal ﬂat costs from actually 2012 to 2018, as well as capital release from Oregon [ph]
feedback book. The capital requirement is leveling oﬀ and will be reduced going forward.
At the same time, we are growing savings and insurance based on a strong position
within occupational pensions and asset management. In combination, this makes
Storebrand well positioned to create shareholder value and release capital to
shareholders through dividends and share buybacks.
If you then move to slide number four, the growth in the unit linked reserves was 11%,
compared to the third quarter last year. Adjusted for the weakening of the Swedish kronor
against Norwegian kroner, the growth was 16%. The growth is driven by strong growth in
premiums and good returns. Growth in asset management is also aﬀected by the
substantial appreciation of the Norwegian kroner. Adjusted for the eﬀect against the
Swedish kronor, the growth was 5%.
Growth within insurance was 6%, this is lower than our long-term ambition of 10%, and is
caused by our shift from expensive external distribution to more cost eﬀective internal
distribution. This together with a transition of the new -- into the new disability pension
product in Norway means that we expect lower growth rate in 2016 and 2017, before we
revert to the double-digit growth rates. Last but not least, the growth within retail banking
is very good and the retail lending portfolio grew 28% from third quarter in 2015.

FINAL

Slide number ﬁve; let me go a bit further into our growth strategy. Storebrand's functional
organization reﬂects the customer value chain. All areas share a common goal of creating
great customer experiences. We use insight from the sales front, and customer service to
develop technological solutions, products and concepts that meet the customers'
demand.
On this slide, some selected initiatives that we have implemented in the third quarter is
showed. One example is the launch of our fossil free funds. We have observed that there
is a signiﬁcant and growing demand for near-index funds, with low carbon footprint. In
particular, public institutions in Scandinavia are adding carbon free to their mandates. We
have responded to this demand by launching three fossil free funds so far. And the sales
have been strong and asset in the management has so far grown to nearly NOK5 billion.

Moving to slide number six, I want to move a bit deeper into one of the examples from
the last slide. Visiting a Doctor's oﬃce is -- really ﬁts our schedule. The journey is time
consuming, and the waiting time is unpredictable. And often all you need is a simple
prescription. What is (inaudible) then to simply pick up your smartphone and visit the
doctor online. This is now possible, if you are an employer that have a health insurance
within Storebrand. Today, we launched medical video consultations in our health app Get
Well and consultations and prescriptions are available right at your ﬁngertips. It doesn't
get any easier than that.
Well, then let's move back to the business in slide number seven. As we already have
touched upon, we are in the middle of a transformation of the business. As illustrated on
the graph, on the right hand side, which shows the shift in fee and administration income
from guaranteed into savings. The stable operating result to the left illustrates that we are
able to substitute the declining income from guaranteed, by creating topline growth in
savings and insurance, as well as holding strict cost control.
And with that, I leave the word to Lars Loddesol.

Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Hello, as we explained in the last quarter we will from this quarter onwards focus on
operating result as the core earnings element that management and the company can
primarily inﬂuence.
As illustrated on page eight in the upper left-hand side with -- in red colors. So you see
that the underlying value creation per quarter here is a stable 450 million to 500 million.
In addition to that, this quarter we have a strong ﬁnancial result of 209 million, ﬁrst and
foremost, created by credit spread contraction in the quarter and which gives a good
result in the company portfolios.
In addition we have special items of minus 27 in the quarter, that's a combination of 62
million -- sorry, 61 million related to laying oﬀ of staﬀ and provisions for laying oﬀ staﬀ and
release of reserves related to disabilities of coverage for high-paid employees in
Storebrand, which we are no longer covered with that disability pension and we can
Page 3 of 14



Company Name: Storebrand ASA
Company Ticker: STB NO Equity
Date: 2016-10-26

release reserves related to that. So the combination of those two numbers 61 and 34 is a
net 27 million in negative one-oﬀ in the quarter.

FINAL

If you look at earnings per share at 1.23 in the quarter after tax, that's a satisfactory level
and the tax calculated for this quarter is normalized at 23%. Customer buﬀers and solidity
capital is maintained at a good level.
Then I would like to jump to page 10, before I go back to page nine afterwards. But if we
start with page 10, the ex transitionals Solvency II level coming into the third quarter was
at 122. Then we have made two major changes to model and assumptions. One is that we
have changed our interest rate modeling where the model -- where we model interest
rates development in the future to a larger extent mere the fact that interest rates can go
negative, that has a negative eﬀect in terms of model changes.

Bloomberg Transcript

And then we have -- the EIOPA has introduced a new volatility adjustment factor for
Norway, which increases the volatility adjustment from 16 basis points to 26 basis points,
that increases the solvency position. The two factors taken together gives a negative
contribution of minus 0.2 percentage point.
Then we've had very good asset returns, primarily driven by good real estate
development and credit spread contraction as I mentioned before, in addition to good
value creation in the group as such, that increases solvency by 3.5 percentage points.
Higher interest rates in Norway, 13 basis points on the 10-year swap rate in the quarter has
contributed positive to 2.4 percentage points in improved solvency. Interest rates in
Sweden have fallen in the same period. However, the asset liability match in Sweden is
very strong and the impact on solvency is limited.
Then we entered into a mass lapse reinsurance contract in the end of last quarter -- in the
end of the third quarter that contributes positive to 3.2 percentage points on the solvency.
Then that leads to a Q3 2016 solvency number of 131, without transitionals and then we
add on the transitional rules by 34 percentage points. And we have made a decision to
change the way we calculate transitional rules to account for tax in the calculation, which
decreases the value of the transitional rules by approximately 25%.
However, that means also that the amortization of transitionals from here on will be 25%
lower. So this is not -- we cast in stone [ph] from EIOPA how this is -- how tax is supposed
to be calculated as part of the transitional rules, but we have decided to make a
conservative estimate and take that out of the transitional rules. And then, we hope to get
the clariﬁcation on the calculations from EIOPA in due course.
If we move back to page nine, the solvency position of Storebrand Group, we see that the
same things I just talked about on the previous picture. But I would like to also mention
that the fact that we have introduced a model for interest rate movements in the future
that allows for negative interest rates, increases the sensitivity to interest rates from 9 to 15
percentage points on the sensitivity scale here. While at the same time, the sensitivity to
spreads decreases as a consequence of the higher volatility adjustment. So those are I
guess the most important takeaways from that.

And with those brief comments, I think we can go over to Q&A. Odd?

FINAL

Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Just before we open up for Q&A, let me just run it oﬀ on slide 20, that is an outlook slide
that we have put into the package. And just brief, third quarter report shows that
Storebrand continues to create capital-eﬃcient and proﬁtable growth, as well as
substantial cost reductions. This happens in parallel with the leveling oﬀ in gradual -- and
gradual reduction of the guaranteed portfolio. This gives a continuous shift in the balance
sheet and the result mix.
We also show that we create good result and increasing solvency capital, even in our
continued low interest rate environment. On the regulatory side, the government
proposes a ﬁnance tax in the national budget. The proposed tax is structured as a
combination of payroll tax and higher company tax. We believe it is updated to introduce
more taxation through our productive industry and particularly our payroll tax which
potentially will hurt jobs in Norway, not the Norwegian ﬁnancial sector.
In addition, we are also disappointed to see that there is a lack of new tax incentives for
private pension savings, but we are continuing our work towards the government to
ensure better solution also for Pillar 3 savings to come along.

Bloomberg Transcript

So with that, I think we'll just open up for Q&A.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We have a few people already in the queue, and the
ﬁrst one comes from Peter Eliot from Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead, your line is now
open.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you very much. The ﬁrst one was on the solvency ratio with transitionals. Could you
just clarify exactly what the change is in terms of the tax assumptions? And just -- just to
conﬁrm, if you had not made any changes, then the ratio would have been 190%, so 25
percentage points higher than you've shown the 165.
Secondly, on the solvency generation, I didn't -- as well [ph] I didn't quite catch all of the
breakdown that you mentioned there, but would you be able to conﬁrm what or how
much of that you would consider underlining -- ongoing that you could expect to get
every quarter and normal quarter stripping out ﬁnancial results or modeling changes or
anything else there?
And plus ﬁnally, just on that tax change that you mentioned, are you able to quantify
roughly the impact that you think that will have the proposed tax change? Thank you.

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Let's start with the ﬁrst one, solvency ratio with transitionals. It would have been 175,
if we didn't do the change. Lars was alluding to the eﬀective tax rate on the transitional
rule itself, that was 25%.
The second question was solvency capital generation and we've said that we will create 5
to 10 percentage points each year. And as you also know then that is also included
normalized risk premiums in the unwinding when we go one-year forward. So we don't
have a more speciﬁc guidance than that on this point in time.
And ﬁnally on the payroll tax, I guess we have said that with today's structure without us
doing any tranche changes, you could estimate that to be in the neighborhood of 50
million, 40 million, 50 million post tax.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks a lot.

Operator
The next question comes from Paul De'Ath from RBC. Please go ahead, your line is now
open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Paul De'Ath
Yeah. Hi, there. And I will also ask a question on solvency, please. And so ﬁrstly, how much
of an impact will the new sub-debt issue on the solvency ratio? And you mentioned on
slide nine. And secondly, and now you've done this tax change on the transitional rules,
does that make any change to your target solvency range and so, yeah, you've mentioned
the potential for buybacks. But I think from the Capital Markets Day, that was using the
solvency ratio including transitional rules over 180%. Is that threshold still a 180% and now
that you've made this change in the transitionals? Thanks.

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

If I just thought, sub-debt is around 3% point eﬀect that becomes into the accounts in the
fourth quarter. Then on dividends, I think most importantly is that we keep on creating
underlying solvency and doing that by 9 percent point this quarter is very satisfactory.
When it comes to the mix between dividends and share buybacks, of course, that is
something that we have to work with going forward. What we have said is that we are
working out, that we want to start paying dividends for 2016 and that you should expect
those to pay at last half a dividend. So it's more about the toolbox that we have in place
to, of course, work with both dividends and share buybacks to create the right capital
situation in the company.

Q - Paul De'Ath
Okay. So just to clarify, so when you talk about buybacks, that's more about the mix of -an ordinary capital return rather than any kind of excess capital return?

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah, we have -- we enter now into a situation where we start paying dividends again. We
have said that we will pay at last a half dividend the ﬁrst year. Going forward, we should
expect those of course to enter into our group dividend payment.
Then of course everything I've talked about with the back book really trailing oﬀ in
combination with the right capital, light growth in our front book. That creates of course
over time a very positive situation when it comes to capital. It might even call for a new
dividend policy. But I think we have to cross that bridge when we come there. Now the
focus is of course start paying dividends again.

Q - Paul De'Ath
Great. Thanks.

Next questions comes from Matti Ahokas from Danske Bank. Please go ahead, your line is
now open.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, good afternoon. Matti Ahokas here from Danske. Three quick questions. Firstly, just
conﬁrming that the solvency ratio will go up in the fourth quarter by 4 to 5 percentage
points because of the sub-debt issuance. Secondly, was one regarding the one-oﬀs that
Lars mentioned earlier on where, on which divisions or units was this booked in?
And then ﬁnally on the tax issue. So I guess we'll know a bit more in November about this
whole situation, but is this 40 million to 50 million increase per annum based on the
26.5% tax on the ﬁnancial industry or something else? Thanks.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Okay. Just to start up, as I just said, the sub-debt in itself will have an uplift on the
numbers we reported on 131 now with 3 percent points in the fourth quarter.

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Yeah, and on the cost side there was a one-oﬀ in the quarter and its dividends as follows,
savings, 12 million increased cost; insurance, 5 million increased cost; guaranteed
pension, 10 million increased cost; and we will also put out an excel spreadsheet on the
web page where we take it down to the sub-segment level.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

And when we talked about ﬁnance cost, the estimates now is that it will be spread
towards a 1.5% increase against the rest of the industry when it comes to the overall
company tax. And then a 5% on the payroll tax. So when we talk about the 40 to 50
million, that is the payroll tax eﬀect that will have direct eﬀect on us because the tax rate
Page 7 of 14



Company Name: Storebrand ASA
Company Ticker: STB NO Equity
Date: 2016-10-26

will be reduced for our other companies. So with the proposal that is in there now, this is
same tax rate actually that is already in our books. So it's only a fact to put it on the risk
[ph] based on payroll tax.

Q - Matti Ahokas

The next questions come from Ashik Musaddi from JP Morgan. Please go ahead, your line
is now open.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Hi. Good afternoon. I have like couple of questions, if you can help me. First of all, you
mentioned that you have now moved to negative interest rate calculation in your Solvency
II. What has triggered that? Is it based on your local regulator or is it based on what EIOPA
has said, or is it just your own prudence because I'm not sure if other companies have yet
adjusted for that. So just want to get a bit of sense on that what is triggering you to put
negative interest rates.

Bloomberg Transcript

Second thing is, in terms of volatility adjusted, you mentioned it has increased from 16
basis points to 24, 26 basis points. Again, what is this change and why only Norway has
experienced such a change because it looks like the volatility adjusted for continental or
Eurozone is like going down, so that would be the second one.
And third one would be, can you give us some clarity around UFR, what sort of UFR is in -is there in your underlying numbers, the 131% ratio and how is it changed? Thank you.

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Yeah, thank you. Let me start with the ﬁrst question on interest rate modeling. It's clear
that when, ﬁrst of all (inaudible) on economic capital calculations for the last 15, 16 years.
We have used up here plus model since 2007. A problem with that model that it don't
allow to negative interest rates, as the interest rates have become negative in Sweden and
interest rate volatility have increased, I think that the model have not been good enough.
So we have done a change to the model as such both to allow for negative interest rates,
but also to increase -- to increase for the volatility in the interest rates as such.
That both lead to of course a reduction in owned census [ph] or now discounting with
negative interest rates, and it also have increased the time (inaudible) options and
guarantees as the volatility of the options that have given the customers increase. So it's
driven by what we see from the model, but our old model has not been good enough for
the current interest rate environment and then we have to change.

Sorry just to, and say -- it's not that regulator has asked you be it EIOPA or be it the
Europe and your FSA has asked you, just like you are doing this change of your own.

FINAL

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

We are doing the change on our own because we are also using these same models to
zero the risk in the company. And we need to believe in our models and we do that and
there has not been any discussion with regulators whatsoever.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Yeah. And when it comes to the change in the volatility adjustment that is given by EIOPA.
They have changed their reference portfolio. Norway is increased from 16 basis points to
26 basis points, and I think it's two countries in Europe where it has increased, and it's
Norway and Poland. In Sweden, it decreased from 43 basis points as I referenced.
And ﬁnally on Ultimate Forward Rate, what we use is 4.22, that is given by EIOPA, we have
also given sensitivity to move to 3.7 as has been discussed by EIOPA and that is shown on
page nine as a reduction of 7 basis points on the underlying solvency and some of the
smaller reduction on the solvency including transitionals.

The next questions comes from Blair Stewart from Bank of America. Please go ahead, your
line is now open.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thank you. Good afternoon, gentlemen. A few questions. Firstly, the reinsurance
agreement that you have entered into, is there any material cost for that reinsurance
agreement on an ongoing basis? That's ﬁrst question.
Related to that, do you -- are you -- are there any other management actions that you're
considering that might help the solvency ratio, that will be good to know?
And ﬁnally, the -- it was very good to see the evolution of the required capital under the
Solvency II model. I noticed the paid up book is still growing. Is it possible to give us a
feeling for how the required capital is moving on a year-on-year basis? Thank you.

FINAL

I will answer the two ﬁrst questions. In terms of the reinsurance contract, it does have a
cost obviously, and we have not published or said what the cost is. But I can assure you,
it's competitive to other kinds of creating Solvency capital, for example, subordinated
loans, this is a more cost eﬀective way to create Solvency capital.
In terms of other management actions, we are constantly looking for things that in a costeﬃcient way can improve the Solvency. And you have -- think that are for free to some
extent like improving results and closing out longevity gaps and creating excess returns,
et cetera, that doesn't come at an explicit cost, and there are things that does have a cost
like subordinated loans and reinsurance.
So we will try to do a lot of things that can improve solvency, improve bettering our
operation, that doesn't come at an explicit IFRS results cost. And we will from time-to-time
do selective things in addition to that. Obviously, we don't or I can't, I will not announce
anything explicitly that we're working on now, but we're constantly looking for good ways
to improve -- improve the solvency at a competitive cost.

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Maybe touching on that, I will be more speciﬁc on SCR, but I think I would start to say that
we -- we still transfer from paid-up policies into -- from deﬁned beneﬁt into paid-up
policies. But we also, as we talked about in our Capital Markets Day, see that the new
paid-up policies typically have better buﬀer capital situation. They are fully reserved for
longevity and there is also lower in general interest rate guarantees in these paid-up
policies.
So there is more evening out of the total capital need in the portfolios even if there still is
some time to go with transitions from deﬁned beneﬁt to paid-up policies, but maybe from
10 [ph] points to (inaudible) on that.
When it comes doing the capital requirements, we are reporting that in NOK13 of
quarterly interim report, of course, on the top level, how many comes without the product
level, I can't conﬁrm that during Q3, the capital requirements for paid-up policies
standalone is somewhat decreased due to both the volatility adjustment that we have
talked about, but also because of increased interest rates, and that -- and ﬁnally due to
the fact that there has been a very good return in those portfolio that have allowed us to
be longevity reserves and also strengthen on the buﬀer capital.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you for the reference to the note. If I can have one follow-up please. Just on
capital generation, is it possible to split out the 3.5 points you have from asset return and
results, should we just take kind of a pro rata number given the 200 million from ﬁnancial
eﬀects, will it be fair to say that 500 million or 700 million, so ﬁve seventh of that 3.5
should be regarded as the operating capital generation.

FINAL

I have to think that although it's tempting to do that, I think it's -- it wouldn't be completely
correct because a lot of the operating variance comes through changes from products
that are within the net present value framework. So there are some direct ﬁnancial
contributions from asset management, insurance and et cetera that comes outside of
solvency calculation. And then you have -- then you have changes within the net present
value framework, everything that's in the -- in the live companies. So I don't think you can
do that straight oﬀ as I see it at least.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay. You've worked hard to get a diﬀerentiation between the operating result and the
ﬁnancial market impact in your P&L, it will be good to have that for the solvency capital
generation as well.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

you.

(Operator Instructions) And we have another question from Peter Eliot from Kepler
Cheuvreux. Please go ahead, your line is now open.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you. Just a bit of a follow-up actually on the volatility adjustment. I mean, the
reason it increased for Norway was that the weighting [ph] of corporate bonds was
increased and the reference portfolio from sort of 54% to 60% I believe. I mean, it's quite
a high level. I guess given that your quite high proportion of the Norwegian industry and
the reference portfolios lags quite a long time. You've got some sort of insight on how
that's developed -- is likely to develop. Could you remind us how your own sort of
corporate bond weighting, I mean I think it's been increasing recently, but how sort of
varies to the rest of the industry?

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

I don't have this detail in front of me. Peter, I think we gave quite a few slides on that
during the Capital Markets Day, and I think they are still very representative for our
portfolio. It's of course when they are making this reference portfolio for Norwegian
market, Storebrand, DNB and KLP goes into that, and of course the Storebrand as being a
very big player in this market that will have also a quite large inﬂuence on the reference
portfolio and which actually I think is very good because the volatility adjustment can't go
up and they can't go down and that we are really having our wait into that as a reference
portfolio gives us some risk mitigation for changes in the volatility adjustment, because if

Page 11 of 14



Company Name: Storebrand ASA

the volatility adjustment increases that, I mean that the spread on this bonds have
increased and that they have come through in our returns as well.

FINAL

So, I think to answer your question, overall, yes, I think we would have in -- broadly in line
with the reference portfolio and actually I think that is a good thing.

(Operator Instructions) And we do coming through -- two questions coming through. So
we have ﬁrst Ashik Musaddi from JP Morgan. Please go ahead, your line is now open.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi, thanks for another opportunity. Just one follow-up question on UFR. You reminded
that every 50 basis point drop is 7 points. Now if we have to believe that UFR goes to the
current level of whatever 1%. So if we need to strip oﬀ say 3.2% of UFR, would the
relationship be linear, i.e., do we need to do seven times 3.2 or would it be more than 3.7
times, 3.2 or would it be less. I'm just trying to understand the magnitude, is it going up or
down based on the convexity? Any thoughts on that would be great. I'm not looking for
absolute number. Thank you.

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Did I understand the question correctly that, you asked what will happen to the
magnitude of the impact if the UFR rate go to 3.2% or 3.7%?

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

All other equal that would be probably less due to convexity, as you say, a large number
than the 7 percentage points.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

So you mean every 50 basis point additional drop would be less than 7 percentage
points?

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

They are more than 7 percentage points.

FINAL

And the next questions comes from Blair Stewart and that is the last question. Blair, your
line is now open.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thanks. Just a follow-up tranche on the -- on the SCR. I know that you've given me the
ammunition. The -- I notice the life capital requirement went down by about 1.8 billion in
the quarter. I'm guessing part of that is the reinsurance agreement, but it doesn't -- it
wouldn't possibly account for half of the change for. What else is going on there, please?

A - Lars Aa. Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

I don't have a detailed answer for you on that at the moment, Blair, I need to look more
into that, but I can conﬁrm that what your (inaudible) is that the reinsurance on the math
left is going into the life -- the model of Solvency II calculation and reduce that ﬁrst.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, okay. If you can come back on that would be very helpful, thank you. Because I think
that change is about seven points from in the quarter. So they -- obviously the -- just about
half of -- the reinsurance is about half of that, little bit less than half of that, so there's
another three or four points, but we can come back to that. Thank you.

Operator
There are no questions coming through. So I will hand the call back to you for any
concluding remarks. Thank you.

A - Kjetil Ramberg Krokje

{BIO 20060140 <GO>}

Okay. We just want to thank you all for joining the call today and we are also present in
London at 14:00 tomorrow at the Warwick Building, if you want to see management then.
So, have a good day and thank you.

Operator
Thank you for joining today's conference. You may now replace your handsets to end this
