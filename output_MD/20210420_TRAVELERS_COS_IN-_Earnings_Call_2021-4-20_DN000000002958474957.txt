And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Alan Schnitzer.

Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Thank you, Abbe. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. We are very
pleased to report first-quarter core income of $699 million or $2.73 per diluted share,
both up from the prior-year quarter despite our highest ever level of first-quarter
catastrophe losses. The higher level of core income for the quarter was driven by very
strong underlying underwriting income, as well as higher levels of favorable prior year
reserve development and net investment income. All of which more than offset the
record level of catastrophe losses.
Underlying underwriting income of $735 million pre-tax was nearly 25% higher than in the
prior-year quarter, driven by an increase in net earned premiums to $7.4 billion and an
underlying combined ratio, which improved almost 2 points to an excellent 89.5%. We are
particularly pleased with strong underlying fundamentals in all three of our business
segments.
In Business Insurance, the underlying combined ratio improved by more than 3 points,
which again included the benefit of earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trend. On
Specialty Insurance and Personal Insurance, both benefited from higher earned premiums
and continued strong margins. Turning to investments, our high-quality investment

portfolio continued to perform well, generating net investment income of $590 million
after-tax for the quarter, up 14% in the prior-year quarter.

FINAL

These results together with our strong balance sheet enable us to grow adjusted book
value per share by 9% over the past year after making important investments in our
business and returning excess capital to shareholders.
During the quarter we returned $613 million of excess capital to shareholders, including
$397 million of share repurchases. In recognition of our strong financial position
confidence in our business, I'm pleased to share that our Board of Directors declared a
4% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.88 per share, marking 17 consecutive
years of dividend increases with a compound annual growth rate of 9% over that period.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our Board also authorized an additional $5 billion of share repurchases. Turning to
production, we remain pleased with the execution of our marketplace strategies. During
the quarter, we grew net written premiums by 2% to $7.5 billion. Our premium growth
once again reflects strong renewal premium change and retention in each of our three
segments. Business Insurance renewal premium change increased to 9.2%, its highest
level since 2013 and 4 points higher than the prior-year quarter. While retention remained
strong and workers' compensation pure renewal rate change was slightly negative but
continued on an improving trend.
Workers' comp renewal premium change which includes exposure was positive for the
first time in a number of quarters. Both renewal rate change, annual premium change in
every other product line are near or above recent record highs. Net written premiums in
Business Insurance were down a little bit year-over-year driven overwhelmingly by the
workers' comp product line, primarily reflecting the impact of the pandemic on payrolls as
we are comparing a pandemic impacted quarter in the current year to a largely prepandemic quarter in the prior year.
Bond & Specialty Insurance net written premiums increased by 9% driven by renewal
premium change of nearly 11% in our management liability business while retention
remained strong. Across our commercial businesses, the pricing environment continues to
be rational and favorable with written pricing well above estimated loss cost trends.
Overall pricing levels continued to be near record levels and while margins have improved
given the continued headwinds impacting returns for the industry we expect pricing to
continue to outpace loss trend for some time.
Turning to Personal Insurance production was excellent in the quarter. Net written
premiums increased by nearly 7% driven by renewal premium change of almost 8% in our
Homeowners business and strong retention in new business in both Auto and Home. New
business for both auto and home combined was up 17% compared to the prior-year
quarter, which is the ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in new business.
Demonstrating the ongoing success of our product distribution and customer initiatives.
Before I turn the call over to Dan, given the elevated frequency and severity of
catastrophes in recent years, including the recent severe winter weather, I'd like to take a

FINAL

minute and highlight the work we've done in terms of the strategic management of our
catastrophe exposure. Some number of years ago and consistent with our approach
generally of recognizing, assessing, and addressing trends rapidly we took decisive action
in anticipation of continued weather volatility.
Our efforts starting with talent. We are an expert in data science, meteorology,
geophysics, and environmental engineering among others for our Cat management
organization. We also established dedicated teams for each catastrophe peril with the
goal of developing industry-leading scientific and underwriting expertise. We have
incorporated the results into our product development, risk selection, pricing, capital
allocation, and claim response.
The insights we have developed have enabled us to supplement standard vendor cat
models with our own sophisticated peril by peril view. This gives us a refined granular view
of cat risk, incorporating proprietary variables such as complex route characteristics, tree
and brush density and location intelligence down to the parcel level.

Bloomberg Transcript

These variables are incorporated into our product development enhancing segmentation.
They're also integrated into proprietary algorithms that we use at the point of sale to
inform risk selection and decisions about terms and conditions. In terms of our claim
response, our data scientists and other experts have developed geospatial tools, artificial
intelligence, and analytic models to facilitate a more effective tailored deployment claim
resources.
This has resulted in a more satisfying experience for our customers and a more efficient
outcome for us. Taken together, these efforts have enabled us to more effectively
manage our exposure to catastrophes, while there is always the potential for us to have
outsized exposure to an event. Over the past five years, our share of property
catastrophe losses relative to total property catastrophe losses for the domestic P&C
industry has declined significantly compared to the five years prior to that. Our property
cat losses over the past five years, have also been meaningfully lower than our
corresponding market share.
Advancing our understanding of the risk and reward of catastrophe underwriting is an
ongoing effort for us. As a footnote, but importantly, we've made these and other
strategic investments in our business while we improved our expense ratio.
So to sum up, the strength of our underwriting and investment expertise enabled us to
deliver strong profitability in this quarter notwithstanding the severe winter weather. As a
result, we are off to a terrific start for the year. We are particularly pleased with the strong
underlying fundamentals in all three of our business segments. Our proven strategy,
strong track record of execution, leading analytics, talent advantage give us confidence
and we are well positioned to capitalize on opportunities as the economy recovers.
And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to Dan.

{BIO 20727678 <GO>}

FINAL

Thank you, Alan. Core income for the first quarter was $699 million, up from $676 million in
the prior year quarter and core return on equity was 11.1%. Increase in core income
resulted primarily from a higher level of net favorable prior year reserve development,
improved underlying underwriting results, and increased net investment income, largely
offset by a much higher level of catastrophe losses.
Our first quarter results include $835 million of pre-tax cat losses, an all-time high for our
first quarter cats and an increase of $502 million compared to last year's first quarter. This
quarter's cats includes $703 million from the February winter storms, which impacted
Texas and a number of other states. Prior year reserve development for which I'll provide
more details shortly was net favorable $317 million pretax in the quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our pre-tax underlying underwriting gain of $735 million was 24% higher than in the prior
year quarter, reflecting higher levels of earned premium and an underlying combined
ratio, which improved by 1.8 points from a year ago to 89.5%. The improvement in the
underlying combined ratio resulted largely from the continued impacts of earned pricing
exceeding loss cost trends in our commercial businesses and continued favorable loss
conditions in personal auto.
These improvements were partially offset by the comparison of more typical non-cat
weather this year to relatively benign, non-cat weather in last year's first quarter. After-tax
net investment income increased by 14% from the prior year quarter to $590 million as
higher returns in our non-fixed income portfolio were partially offset by the impact of the
expected decline in fixed income yields.
Consistent with our comments on the fourth quarter earnings call and in our 10-K, we
continue to expect that for the remainder of 2021, fixed income NII including earnings
from short-term securities will be between $420 million and $430 million per quarter after
tax. Turning to prior year reserve development, total net favorability of $317 million pre-tax
in the quarter included a $72 million benefit from a subrogation settlement with Southern
California Edison related to the Woolsey fire of 2018.
$62 million of that benefit was recorded in Personal Insurance, with the remainder
recorded in Business Insurance. Beyond that subrogation benefit net favorable PYD in
Personal Insurance reflected both auto and property losses coming in better than
expected for recent accident years. In Bond & Specialty net favorable PYD was driven by
better than expected results in the surety book. In Business Insurance net favorable PYD
was driven by better-than-expected loss experience in workers' comp, partially offset by
some adverse development on losses for environmental exposures in our run-off book.
Regarding reinsurance as discussed during our fourth quarter results call, we renewed our
underlying property aggregate catastrophe XOL treaty for 2021 providing aggregate
coverage of $350 million part of $500 million of losses above the aggregate retention of
$1.9 billion. Through March 31, we have accumulated $915 million of qualifying losses
towards the aggregate retention.

FINAL

Turning to capital management, operating cash flows for the quarter of $1.2 billion were
again very strong. All our capital ratios were at or better than target levels. So we ended
the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.8 billion. Our net unrealized
investment gain decreased from $4.1 billion after tax at year-end to $2.8 billion after tax at
March 31 as interest rates rose during the quarter.
Adjusted book value per share, which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses,
was $101.21 at quarter end up 2% from year-end and up 9% from a year ago. We returned
$613 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter comprising share repurchases of
$397 million and dividends of $216 million. Following this quarter's share repurchase
activity, we had a little more than $800 million remaining under the previously authorized
repurchase program. In order to provide appropriate capital management flexibility and
reflecting its confidence in our business, the Board authorized an additional $5 billion for
share repurchases.
And as Alan also mentioned, our Board authorized an increase in the quarterly dividend to
$0.88 per share. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Greg for a discussion of Business
Insurance.

Gregory C. Toczydlowski

{BIO 16615940 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks, Dan. Business Insurance produced $317 million of segment income for the first
quarter, a 10% increase over the first quarter of 2020 driven by higher levels of underlying
underwriting income, net favorable prior year reserve development in net investment
income, which more than offset higher catastrophe losses.
We're particularly pleased with the underlying combined ratio of 93.7%, which improved
by 3.6 points, a little less than 2 points of that resulted from earned pricing that exceeded
loss cost trends. The improvement also reflects the comparison to the net charge we
took in the prior year quarter related to the pandemic. Turning to the top-line, net written
premiums were down 2% primarily due to lower net written premiums in the workers'
compensation, product line as a result of the impact of the pandemic on payrolls.
Net written premium benefited from strong retention, higher renewal rate change and a
return to positive exposure growth reflecting improving trend in our customers outlook for
their businesses. Turning to domestic production, renewal rate change remained strong at
8.4%, up 2.5 points from the first quarter of last year, while retention remained high at
83%. Written pricing for some time now has been exceeding loss trend and is significantly
improving the margins of our book.
Importantly, we believe we have a high-quality book of business and seek to maintain high
retentions. With that in mind, we continue to execute deliberately and granularly on
account by account and class by class basis. We remain exceptionally pleased with our
execution. As for the individual businesses in select renewal rate change increased to
4.5%, up almost 3 points from the first quarter of 2020. Retention of 78% reflects
deliberate execution as we pursue improved returns in certain segments of this business.

FINAL

As I mentioned above, we're pleased with the segmented execution underneath the
aggregate result. New business of $95 million was down $24 million from the prior-year
quarter also driven by our focus on improving profitability as we remain disciplined around
risk selection, underwriting, and pricing.
Importantly, we have not slowed down our commitment to invest in product development
and ease of doing business, which position us well for the long-term profitable growth in
this business. As an example in previous quarters, we've highlighted our completely
redesigned BOP 2.0, small commercial product, which includes industry-leading
segmentation and a fast easy quoting experience.
During the last three months, we rolled out the new product in additional seven states,
bringing the cumulative total to 30 states, representing approximately 60% of our CMP
new business premium. We are encouraged with our agents' adoption of the new product
as both flow in new business premium are meaningfully improved as compared to the
legacy BOP product. In middle market renewal rate change was strong at 9.1%, up almost
3 points from the first quarter of 2020, while retention remained high at 86%. Additionally,
we achieved positive rate of more than 80% of our accounts this quarter, a 10 point
increase from the first quarter of last year.

Bloomberg Transcript

New business was down $12 million driven by certain business units and geographies
where returns are not meeting our thresholds. To sum up, we're pleased with our
execution and further improving the underlying margins in the book we continue to invest
in the business for long-term profitable growth.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.

Thomas M. Kunkel

{BIO 16615934 <GO>}

Thanks, Greg. Bond & Specialty posted strong returns and solid growth in the quarter
despite the ongoing headwinds of COVID-19. Segment income was $137 million, an
increase of 12% from the prior-year quarter, driven by an improved underlying
underwriting margin and higher business volumes. Elevated cat losses related to the
Texas weather event were largely offset by favorable prior year reserve development.
The underlying combined ratio of 84.2% improved by 1.5 due to an improved expense
ratio, primarily reflecting higher earned premiums. Earned pricing that exceeded loss cost
trends was largely offset by the impact of COVID-19 and other loss activity. Turning to the
top-line net written premiums grew 9% in the quarter, primarily reflecting strong
management liability production, decreased demand for new construction surety bonds
due to the economic impacts of COVID-19 are largely offset by strong commercial surety
production.
In our management liability business, we are pleased that the renewal premium change
remained near historic highs of nearly 11% while retention was a strong 87%. Management
liability, new business for the quarter decreased $8 million, primarily reflecting our

Page 7 of 22



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2021-04-20

disciplined underwriting in this elevated risk environment. Consistent with recent quarters
submissions were up, while "activity" was down.

FINAL

These production results demonstrate the successful execution of our strategies to
maintain underwriting discipline and pursue rate where needed while maintaining strong
retention levels in our high-quality portfolio. So Bond & Specialty results were again strong
despite the challenges in the current environment.
And now, I'll turn it over to Michael to discuss Personal Insurance.

Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

Thank you, Tom and good morning everyone. Personal Insurance began 2021 with strong
profitability and growth. Segment income was $314 million and net written premiums grew
7%. The combined ratio of 90.3% was about 2 points from the prior-year quarter, primarily
due to higher levels of catastrophe losses, partially offset by higher net favorable prior
year reserve development.

Bloomberg Transcript

On an underlying basis, the combined ratio was a strong 85.4%. Before I turn to product
line results, let me remind you that we have updated the presentation of certain financial
and statistical data for our automobile and homeowners and other product lines to
include the result of direct to consumer and international. This new presentation provides
a more comprehensive view of product line results. Automobile delivered another very
strong quarter with a combined ratio of 81.8%, an improvement of more than 9 points
compared to the first quarter of 2020.
The improvement comprises 5 points of higher net prior year reserve development and
an underlying combined ratio that is 4 points better than the prior-year quarter. These
results reflect the ongoing effects of the pandemic, namely lower claim frequency due to
fewer miles driven. That said, we have begun to see miles driven moving back toward
pre-pandemic levels as restrictions have eased and economic activity is picking up.
We're actively monitoring current trend and incorporating them into our state specific
pricing decisions as we continue to balance business volumes and profitability. In
homeowners and other, the first quarter combined ratio of 99.4% increased by 15 points
relative to the prior year quarter, driven by catastrophe losses of 22 points up over 11
points, with most coming from the February winter storm and freeze events and an 8point increase in the underlying combined ratio, primarily due to a comparison to unusually
mild winter weather in the prior-year quarter.
Along with about 2 points of elevated fire losses, many of which relate to extreme winter
weather often resulting from the use of alternative heating sources. The increases were
partially offset by 5 points of higher net favorable prior reserve development, which
included the subrogation benefits of the Woolsey wildfire that Dan mentioned.
Turning to domestic production automobile net written premiums grew 3% with 14%
growth in new business while retention remained strong at 84%. Renewal premium
Page 8 of 22

FINAL

change was about flat. Consistent with our plan to align pricing with our loss experience in
auto. We are very pleased with our ongoing balanced execution in this line, which has
resulted in 4% year-over-year policies enforced growth at attractive returns.
Homeowners and other delivered another strong quarter with net written premium
growth of 12%. New business was up 21% from the prior year quarter. Retention remained
strong at 85% and renewal premium change was 7.7%. As Alan mentioned, we have
achieved double-digit new business growth across auto and home for each of the past
nine quarters. Our ongoing new business success is driven by a combination of strategic
investments and initiatives including Quantum Home 2.0, IntelliDrive, and new expanded
partnerships and distribution relationships.
In addition to delivering strong results for the quarter, we continue to rollout new and
expanded capabilities to deliver value in the eyes of our customers. Recent examples
include closing on the acquisition of InsuraMatch our digital independent agency that
expands our capabilities to serve customers and distribution partners, improving our
customer self-service capabilities with the rollout of our new My Travelers mobile
application, continuing the rollout of our digital quote proposal to further enhance our
agents digital capabilities, further expanding our new version of IntelliDrive into Canada
and eight additional states, and adding digital auto discount in nine more states for
customers who leverage paperless telematics and mobile applications.

Bloomberg Transcript

In summary, we're off to a great start to the year and are well-positioned to continue to
deliver profitable growth. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Abbe.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Certainly. (Operator Instructions). Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley, your line is open.

Q - Michael W. Phillips

{BIO 21023048 <GO>}

Thanks, good morning everybody. First question on Business Insurance. I guess, as we
kind of think about the rest of the year and Alan, your comments on pricing, continue to
outpace loss trends. I guess want to get your take on how the renewal price -- renewal
premium change should -- we should expect that to continue to rise, given the impact or
maybe better exposure growth for the year and how you think about that versus maybe a
continued deceleration in pricing. So how we can think about maybe the RPC for Business
Insurance?

FINAL

Good morning, Michael, thanks for the question. We stopped giving outlook on price
change, but I'll make a couple of comments that hopefully are responsive. We are now
several years into compounding year-over-year improvement in rate and price. The three
sequential quarters prior to this one, I think in Business Insurance anyway, all made record
prices. So that's pretty good progress, as consequences are improving.
But having said that, the drivers of price change overall are environmental and still
relevant. So, we expect that overall pricing and pure rate for that matter will continue to
be at levels that, that results in expanding margins for a while. Whether prices in particular
lines go up, down or sideways. I don't think we're going to try to predict that, but it's all
pretty rational, it's all pretty relative to the rate what we needed.
And again, there's always a lot of focus on that headline number because that's what we
provide. But we're looking hard at the granular execution underneath that takes into
account all the variables of account rate adequacy. So we feel great about this pricing
level, we are near all-time highs in pricing, and we expect to continue -- the favorable
environment to continue for some time.

Q - Michael W. Phillips

{BIO 21023048 <GO>}

Okay, thanks, Alan. I guess one more if we could switch over then through the
authorization. Anything to read there on that that would signify any interest or lack of
interest in any kind of large scale M&A?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Dan, you take that.

A - Dan Frey

{BIO 20727678 <GO>}

Michael, it's Dan. No signal at all, that's simply the math I gave you by the time we did the
repurchases we did in the first quarter of this year, we were down to $800 million of
authorization remaining under the share repurchase. If you look at, our history over the
last 10 or 12 years, every time we sort of get down to this level the Board authorizes an
additional buyback and this was just the timing to do that.

Q - Michael W. Phillips

FINAL

Hey, guys. Good morning. Just following up on that one with rate, just trying to get a feel
for, if we look at the 8.4% rate increases, are we seeing more accounts that are closer to
rate adequate and that 8.4% is a product of some accounts needing a lot and some not
needing much at all? Or if we were to look at across the book of renewals, is it safe to say
that you're still getting positive rate on kind of the vast majority of accounts that are
renewing?

A - Gregory C. Toczydlowski

{BIO 16615940 <GO>}

Morning Ryan, this is Greg. Yes, we absolutely are in the vast majority of our accounts are
getting rate and as Alan said with nine consecutive quarters with year-over-year rate
change certain pockets, of course, are becoming more rate adequate and you know just
as a reminder, as we've shared with you in the past, we really empower our local
underwriters to look at every single account based on its own merit and we think they've
been doing a terrific job of retaining the book and continuing to get some pricing change
across the portfolio.

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Got it. Again, I guess for Alan, just I guess looking for an update on your current thinking
around M&A strategy there. I think in the past you haven't done any larger deals. I think
maybe Simply Business might have been the last one I remember, which was, I think, less
than a bill. How are you thinking about scale, how are you thinking about M&A appetite?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah. Ryan, I understand the question, and albeit the thought process behind it there is no
change in our approach to M&A, and that's not to say that we're not interested. Our
shareholders should expect that all the time we are evaluating transaction opportunities
and thinking about them and we often save some of the best deals we've done or the
deals we didn't do, but that's not to say that we're not often looking and thinking
strategically about what's out there and so we have a view on all the things out there and
all the markets we're in, that might be attractive to us and under what terms and
conditions we want to do them.
And I would have given you the same answer a year ago or five years ago, frankly. And as
we've said many times the lens, we would use for whether we would do a deal or not or
does it improve our long-term return profile, does it reduce volatility, and/or would it
create shareholder value through some other important strategic benefit. So I mean of
course we do the analysis as granularly detailed is something that you would expect from
us, but essentially that's the lens and that hasn't changed.

Q - David Motemaden

{BIO 18818634 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. I guess I had a question for Greg. Was there, just in Business Insurance.
I'm wondering if there was any sort of COVID benefit that you guys had underneath in
that underlying loss ratio that we should be thinking about.

A - Dan Frey

{BIO 20727678 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hey, David. It's Dan Frey. I'll take that. You know, COVID did interest in this quarter and that
we've been living with it for about a year now. Last year as it emerged it was pretty
apparent, what you thought the impact was of COVID because you were looking at it
immediately pre-COVID environment versus something new. It doesn't feel that way
anymore. It's sort of woven into the fabric of the economy and overall results. That's one
of the reasons that even going back to last year we chose to leave everything related to
COVID in our underlying combined ratio and eventually not feasible to be able to
specifically spike out, what do we think the impact of COVID was in the quarter.
Having said that qualitatively, we have some idea. You heard Michael talk about the impact
of COVID on miles driven in PI, didn't get a mention in Business Insurance because we
think it was pretty modest. There was again some level of direct charges related to
COVID specific losses in things like workers' comp, but very modest. And we'd say
probably largely offset, if not slightly more than offset by related benefits and non-COVID

Q - David Motemaden

{BIO 18818634 <GO>}

Got it. Great, that's helpful. And then maybe if I could just follow up on that obviously
great to see the margin expansion, a little under 2 points of underlying loss ratio
improvement NBI that increased from I calculate around 150 basis points in the fourth
quarter, it feels to me like that should continue to improve at a better -- at an increasing
rate, but when I look at due[ph] amount of renewal rate change that you guys have
gotten over the last five to six quarters I would have thought that there would have been
a bit more than 2 points of improvement this quarter.
So maybe you could help me just think about some of the moving pieces here as we think
about margin improvement going forward.

A - Dan Frey

{BIO 20727678 <GO>}

Sure, David. It's Dan again. So I think the numbers that we see coming through Business
Insurance for rate versus trend align with what we've seen from written results over the
last several quarters if you just factor in what's earning its way through. So we did see a
steadily increasing level of rate increase over last year and we are seeing a steadily
increasing level of improvement in terms of the earned impact of rate versus trend, it
moves slowly and it moves in sort of tens of a point changes at a time.

FINAL

I guess the other thing I'd say to keep in mind is, it's not just the simple math of if we got
8 points of rate versus 5 points of trend that's 3 points of margin expansion. It's not, it's
rate versus trend. That's a 3 percentage point difference. But if you translated into loss
ratio points when you consider say theoretically as 60 is loss ratio that translates into little
less than 2 points of margin expansion. So being close to 2 points of margin expansion
and expecting that number to increase maybe very slightly from here as the higher rates
aren't through is right where we thought we'd be.

Q - Joshua Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Yeah, good morning everyone. A few out of left field questions that I hope I can get some
information on. As you restated the personal line segment and I guess folded the directto-consumer business into homeowners and personal auto segments, what does that say
about Travelers interest in the direct to consumer as a channel going forward, should we
expect that Travelers will be a player in that market or it's not really important to your P&L
in the long run, makes more sense just to fold it in.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

Sure, Josh. It's Michael, I would say very specifically the restatement of the financial
doesn't say anything about our commitment to direct to consumer one way or the other,
it's still an important capability for us. Still a segment of the business we're investing in.
Frankly, it got to the point where and you can see it in that the restatement that we gave
you. It was north of $400 million worth of revenue as of the end of last year and it was a
big enough portion of the business frankly that leaving it to the side of the line break out
on the P&L didn't make sense, not that it moved the needle on those numbers that much,
but it was an important part of the business that we thought, it should be fully included in
the P&L statistics.
And then in the domestic production -- production statistics. So that when we do make
investments in, for example, marketing and advertising that drive growth in direct to
consumer we want that to show up in the production results that you see. So I would say it
doesn't indicate a change in our emphasis and if anything I would say, it reinforces the
importance of that business to us, both as a business segment and as essentially a place
to continue to build and test and learn and build capability.

Q - Joshua Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

And similarly, how should I think about simply business going forward sort of two parts;
one, how big is it -- how big does the Travelers think it's going to be over the next few
years and two, not that we need numbers. But when you are taking a quote in from a

You are talking about Simply Business, Josh.

Q - Joshua Shanker

Just as a reminder there, we are the intermediary in that business. We're not the market
behind it. So we wouldn't comment on the profitability of that and I would say about
Simply Business. It continues to be a medium-term initiative that we feel urgent about.
We're not going to break it out more than that, but we are investing in it. It is a very
important capability for us. So far the small commercial market hasn't really adopted a
direct approach to buying the product other than at a very micro-end, but we're not
betting, that's going to stay the same and we're investing in capabilities to make sure that
we are prepared to address that market as it matures. Greg anything?

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question is on, going back to the Business Insurance
discussion. So it sounds like you guys are kind of looking for a stable rate, I guess across
your businesses hoping to kind of confirm, I guess that would be the case kind of stable
through the balance of this year, just based off with some commentary and then would
you guys expect workers comp, it sounds like that feels slightly negative. Would you
expect that to inflect this year, or perhaps that's something that we should more be
thinking about in 2022?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Elyse on the go forward view of rate, we actually didn't give a view of direction other than
to say we expect it to continue to be at levels that will continue to contribute to margin
expansion and we're just trying to get away from given outlook and prognosticating, but
we feel great about what we achieved in terms of pricing this quarter and we feel very
good about the outlook for pricing.

Bloomberg Transcript

In terms of workers' comp, we've said in recent quarters, that it feels like we're pretty
close to making a bottom and turning around and we continue to feel that way. We saw
progress in the quarter, both in terms of pure rate, which was slightly negative but a
steady improvement over the last several quarters. Renewal premium change, as I said,
including exposure was positive for the first time a few quarters which we think really
speaks to our customers' confidence. So that was a really good thing.
So that's what we share. But I guess the other point I would say Elyse is it turns out that
the workers' comp experienced through COVID we so far we're being cautious about
this, but, at least so far, what we see in the data is that it's a little bit better than we
expected and that could impact pricing going forward. I don't, I think the likely result of
that is maybe instead of hitting the bottom and inflecting positively it hits the bottom and
bounces around there a little bit before making the term positive.
But again, not a bad sign. It's reflective of the profitability of the line, which has been very
strong, and we continue to think we're making a bottom and moving towards a turn north.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay, great. And then my second question, going back on the M&A discussion. Alan, I
think you said you guys would consider deals with the caveat of not wanting to add to the
volatility of the company. As you think about transactions on are there certain business
lines that are higher up on the list as you evaluate potential M&A? Can you just help us
think through potential transactions from where you might want to add on to business
offering?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

I guess, when we put the comment was, of the three prongs to the lens as we think about
reducing volatility is one of the virtues that we might look for. I guess to your question
when we think about our portfolio, we think about our capabilities, we think about the
breadth and depth of our business we feel great. There is nothing missing from our

portfolio of businesses, we can keep going exactly the way we are and compete very
successfully.
Having said that, there are various opportunities and some of them could be for scale,
some of them could be for products, some of them could be geography. I mean there is
all sorts of things that in one circumstance or another might contribute to an attractive
acquisition opportunity for us. So it's hard for me to say this is what we're looking for.
That's what we're looking for. Again, no gaps in capabilities but potentially some
opportunities.

Q - Michael Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Great guys. Good morning. Maybe sticking with our Business Insurance, you gave us some
nuggets about kind of recent loss trend, I think you said there might be a slight benefit,
workers' comp is trending a little better than expected and I know you guys for longer-tail
lines you probably don't want to take a lot of good news in the near term, but maybe you
can kind of give us a sense, other commercial long tail lines are you seeing frequency
benefit or severity benefit or kind of has the world in terms of the kind of the courts kind
of gotten back to normal or maybe even more than normal in the digital age, zoom age?
So kind of curious if you could give us some kind of color on the near term loss trends
you've been seeing in commercial long tail lines?

A - Dan Frey

{BIO 20727678 <GO>}

Sure, Mike. It's Dan. So I'll take that maybe in a couple of parts. On the court and -question and sort of that activity let's say, we see that to continue to be pretty slow. We
talked about it last year in terms of there is definitely a change in the data from the fact
that courts were closed for a long time and other settlements have been less active. And I
think that continues, and I think we'll probably take a while to work through what could be
the backlog there.
So what we've done in terms of both our view of current accident year and prior accident
year reserve adequacy is to assume that nothing really has changed so the data might tell
you that things look a little bit favorable. We're not really going to react to that. Our
assumption is that once things do get back to normal, ultimately what we're going to see
is social inflation at the levels and the trends that we've seen it before, loss cost trend at

Page 16 of 22

Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2021-04-20

FINAL

the elevated rates that we talked about even in the second quarter of last year as that
ultimately these things will all settle out in reflection of those level.
So to the degree that we talked about some favorability last year and we had some
favorability in prior year reserve development this year a lot of that is frequency driven
where the losses themselves have simply not emerged but from a severity perspective,
we're still going to take the view that we think that severity pressure has not really gone
away. And that's one of the reasons that you see us continuing to pursue rate in Business
Insurance to the degree that we are.

Q - Michael Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Okay, that's very helpful and my follow-up is probably for Dan, on the investment
portfolio. Curious if you can update us on approximate new money yields in the fixed
income portfolio versus the expiring portfolio yield. I know there has been a pickup in
interest rates. I believe there's still a gap there that you guys are trying to overcome?

A - Dan Frey

{BIO 20727678 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, Mike there is still a gap. So it's just, -- it's a little less than it was. Last quarter, we
were talking about that gap being maybe 150 basis points, now maybe it's closer to 90 or
100 basis points, but it's still negative and a reminder just the portfolio turns over slowly
enough that even when we factored in the current environment that didn't actually change
as we gave a $10 million range around our quarterly view of fixed income NII on a goforward basis. So it moved to the needle but only very, very modestly. Still a gap, so yes,
new money yields still below what's maturing on the portfolio.

Yes, thank you. A couple of just quick ones here, first, I'm just curious, could you comment
on workers' compensation insurance. As we start to see payrolls increasing here should
that have a positive benefit on margins?

A - Gregory C. Toczydlowski

{BIO 16615940 <GO>}

Hey Brian. Good morning, this is Greg. The short answer on that is yes. And we saw that
this quarter as Alan said on an RPC basis workers' comp was up and obviously we don't
project where exposure is going to go long term but what we have shared with you that
we are a broad solution of the economy. So, as the economy hopefully corrects and
improves, we'll see positive in payroll mostly from new employees in shares and certainly
we'll see some of that on the GL side with sales receipts increase and also.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Right which favorably impacts margins, that is top-line.

FINAL

A - Dan Frey

{BIO 20727678 <GO>}

Yeah, Brian, margins to the -- you get two pieces of exposure coming through comp. One
could be more workers, for which there is not really an expected margin benefit related
to that in and of itself to the degree that we just go up and we collect more -- more
premium for effectively the same risk that can -- that's what we have historically said a
portion of exposure can behave like rate, that's where you see that.
So it's a little bit of both. To the degree that workers are being added to the payroll that
brings with it additional risk, higher -- higher wages bring higher exposure as well.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

And obviously, as volumes go up, regardless of which those come from you get some
expense levers.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Makes sense. And then, can I just focus a little bit on the premium in Business Insurance,
workers' comp I understand also saw CMP continue to be down, is that just purely related
to what's going on from economic activity or are there other things that are going on right
now there where you're calling your portfolio underwriting initiatives to stuff that are
potentially pressuring that top line and perhaps, are there any kind of programs in place
to kind of recharge that growth at some point.

A - Gregory C. Toczydlowski

{BIO 16615940 <GO>}

Yeah, Brian, this is Greg. Really, two drivers in that. The first one, you mentioned in my
prepared comments. We've really been trying to improve the profitability of that book
and you can see that with the RPC increase in 5 points over the last five quarters. And so
that's the primary driver. But we are still feeling the COVID impact flow overall in terms of
submissions from the volume from our agents is down also, but I would also say that is
the secondary driver.

Good morning, everybody. My first question is in Personal Lines, can you talk about the
uptick in the expense ratio, considering that premiums are not for up quite a bit, where if
that maybe it would remain a bit flatter, where are you investing there?

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

FINAL

Sure, this is Michael. The uptick in the expense ratio really is volume-related costs and
commisions, think report ordering. We do continue to make investments in the business
and increase our investment level slightly, but really the driver of the uptick in the expense
ratio was just volume-related costs in the business, and I wouldn't pay too much attention
to a one-quarter change in expenses. We still feel good about the expense ratio, the
efficiency in the business.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Okay and then my second question in Bond & Specialty. I was just curious about the
comment that new business declined due to discipline. I'm just trying to read that with the
fact that management liability rates are near all-time highs. I would have thought that even
with discipline, you'd have more opportunities to write new business, maybe talk about
the dynamics there?

A - Thomas M. Kunkel

{BIO 16615934 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Sure. Well, you know, the new business flow is actually up. But when you think of some of
the lines that we write the situation we've been through economically speaking can create
more risk. So think of things like employment practices liability, think about some of the
trends that have been in place for public company D&O, so there are number of things
going on that at this point in time, it makes sense to really be prudent about the risk
you're selecting and we really actually feel quite comfortable with where our new
business is coming in.

Boy Scout Association that's getting a lot of attention. In our research, we saw that 31

New York, but wondering how you feel about this strength in your reserve in light of
potentially higher reviver cases, beyond New York.

A - Dan Frey

{BIO 20727678 <GO>}

Hi Tracy. It's Dan. I think we were very -- very early to tackle child victims act stuff,
remember we took our charge related to New York in the first quarter of 2019. So I think
pretty far ahead of the market. We've been very cognizant of abuse, molestation, and
CVA type exposures. We are, as you would imagine staying very up to speed on
developments and potential developments not only across the state, but with stories like
boy scouts, we are very cognizant of our exposures and what the latest news may mean
for those exposures and we continue to be quite comfortable with how those things are
reflected in our reserves.

had some cyber claims this quarter and those actually hit our numbers a little bit, but
generally it was COVID and a variety of other things.

news about California's Insurance Commissioner looking for more data and possibly more
rebate? How are you thinking about that for Travelers?

A - Michael F. Klein

{BIO 19674145 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Sure Meyer, Good question, and I would say, certainly California is one of a number of
states that continue to examine rate levels and premium relief. First and foremost we're
working closely with state regulators across the country and continue to remain in contact
and respond to request for information. For the most part, our approach to balancing rate
level of (inaudible) experience has been to manage it through rate and I've mentioned it
before but since the onset of the pandemic, we've actually now filed decreases in about
20 states across the country.
California doesn't happen to be one of those. You may recall in the latter half of 2020 we
actually provided an additional premium refund to California policyholders are partly in
response to the ongoing dialog with the State of California, but broadly speaking, I would
say, we remain in contact and conversation with the Department of insurance including
California and are working to be responsive to again request for information and or
request for level adjustments, et cetera. So we just continue to monitor and manage the
situation.
