{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Good morning, and welcome to our 2021 Interim Results Presentation. I will shortly run
through the flows, funds under management, and the Partnership, before handing over to
Craig, to cover the financial result. It'd then be back to me, to cover outlook, and lead the
Q&A session, with the full executive team.
Having announced on our strategic goals in February, I've hosted an in-depth Capital
Market event in May. Today's interim results presentation will naturally be shorter than
normal, which will leave more time for questions.
Let's start by recapping on those medium-term targets we announced back in February.
First, we aim to grow new business by 10% per annum, supported by a growing number
of advisers and increasing productivity. Second, by maintaining strong retention of client

FINAL

investments, we will see net inflows also growing by 10% per annum. These flows,
together with modest growth in investment markets would see funds under management
reach more than GBP200 billion by the end of 2025. And third, while we will continue to
invest in the business to support our continued growth and maintain our market leading
position, the technological foundations that we have put in place, over the last few years,
provide us with greater operating flexibility and efficiency, such that our controllable
expense growth going forward will be around 5% per annum.
We then went on to say that the combination of these planning assumptions, together
with the increasing cash emergence from funds in gestation over time, should provide for
strong growth in the underlying cash result, over the coming years. So just six months into
the five-year plan, how are we doing?
Well, let's start with the Partnership. During the first half of the year, we have a attracted a
net, a 139 advisers to the Partnership, through a combination of recruiting experienced
advisers and Academy graduations. That's growth of 3.2%. A good start to our 2021
ambition of growing the partnership by 3% to 5%. And this takes the size of the
Partnership to 4,477. And I'm pleased to say, we've recently gone past the milestone of
4,500 advisers.

Bloomberg Transcript

Furthermore, it's very encouraging that the pipeline remains strong, and we currently have
277 individuals at various stages on their journey through the Academy.
Looking now at productivity. After experiencing a tricky external environment over recent
years, I'm pleased to say that the productivity per adviser is back on an upward trajectory,
having increased by 23%, compared with the first six months of 2020. Although
productivity is now more or less back to the highs of 2018, there remains plenty of further
potential growth, as Peter Edwards talked about in some depth, at the Capital Markets
event.
That strong growth in productivity, supported by the growth in the number of advisers,
naturally flows through to new business. So I'm delighted to report that gross flows were
up 27% in the first half of the year at some GBP9.2 billion. We have continued to
experience strong retention of client funds, providing for net flows for the first six months
of GBP5.5 billion, higher by 23% and equivalent to 8.6% of opening funds under
management on an annualized basis.
We're often asked, why our retention is so strong? And I put this down to a number of
factors. First and foremost, are the excellent partner/client relationships and the high
quality advice and service. To pick up on the advice word, our business is advised, part of
a holistic financial plan, which includes a steady hand for clients during challenging
environments. Furthermore, client investments are both holded [ph] in tax wrappers and
long-term in nature. It's not transient money or money following the latest trend or fad.
Then, as highlighted at our Capital Markets event, clients can switch between our funds
and asset categories free of charge, and in most cases, free of a tax event. They also
have the added benefit of knowing the assets are held on their behalf by SJP, and that we

FINAL

select, monitor, and where necessary, change fund manager. And finally for me, it's
important to remember that our client relationships are well-diversified, as indeed are our
adviser relationships.
And what do I mean by that? Well, put quite simply, whilst we are disappointed to lose any
clients, an individual client withdrawing their investments does not have a real impact on
the balance of our funds under management. Translating this into investment speak, I
would say that quality of our earnings is very strong.
It also helps to explain, why we can be confident of strong retention in the years ahead,
which together with new business will continue that historic trend of net inflows every
quarter of every year.

Bloomberg Transcript

I have to say, this is one of my favorite slides. It clearly demonstrates the resilience of the
business, as we have recorded net inflows through all market conditions, including during
those challenging years of the financial crisis back in 2008, and of course, the recent
pandemic. And if we were to extend the chart back over the years, then the pattern of
net inflows every quarter would be the same. I do not recall a quarter throughout our
history where we experienced a net outflow.
Now also we're clearly delighted and very encouraged with this outcome. The strong
growth compared to the first six months of 2020 should be considered in the light of the
particularly difficult trading conditions last year. So perhaps a better measure of our
progress is growth compared with the first six months of 2019, a period, where gross
flows were GBP7.4 billion and net flows were GBP4.4 billion. On this basis, our gross and
net inflows for the first half of 2021 represented compound growth of some 12% per
annum over the two-year period.
Turning now to funds under management. Those net flows together with the positive
impact of investment markets have resulted in funds under management closing the half,
at a record GBP143.8 billion, up 11% year-to- date and 15% compound growth over the two
years.
In fact, looking over the longer-term, funds under management have seen compound
growth of more than 15% over 5-, 10-, and 15 years, a resilient performance through all
market conditions, and another favorite slide of mine. Growth in new business and funds
under management have resulted in strong growth in income, whilst controllable
expenses for the first six months were modestly-lower than the first half of 2020. The
combination of the income and expense outcomes, together with the increase in cash
emergence from funds in gestation has resulted in a strong financial result. An opportune
moment to hand over to Craig.

Craig Gordon Gentle

{BIO 20095126 <GO>}

Thanks, Andrew, and welcome from me too. So this morning, I'll summarize the key areas
of our half year reporting, namely the cash result, which should be seen as value
emerging in the period as cash; the embedded value result, which gives an indication of
Page 3 of 25



Company N ame: St James' s Place PL C
Company Ticker: STJ L N Equity
Date: 2021-07-28

FINAL

value created, which will emerge in the future; and capital, all of which have shown good
progress during the first half of the year. I'll also touch on the interim dividend declared
this morning.
Let's start with the cash result, where we see a very different profile to that of 2020. Net
income from funds under management increased by 27% to GBP278.2 million. This
reflects higher mature funds under management, driven by new ISA and unit trust
business, that's revenue-generating from day one, as well as funds in gestation maturing
and therefore generating income for the first time.
Another key factor has, of course, been the markets, which have been consistently-strong
for much of the first half, particularly when compared to the second quarter of 2020. The
margin on income from funds continues to be within the guided range of 63- to 65 basis
points, and this is the range you should continue to assume in your models.

Bloomberg Transcript

I've touched on gestation already, but it's worth emphasizing that the first half result has
benefited from somewhere in the region of GBP20 million from maturing funds under
management. And at the 30 of June, we now have GBP47.3 billion in the hopper, which is
yet to contribute. This balance based on some simple modeling assumptions, will
generate an income stream of approximately GBP375 million of net income from fund in
six years' time, or GBP1.4 billion cumulatively, by the end of year six.
It's worth noting that we're now beginning to enter the period where we will benefit from
some of the significant growth years that followed pension freedom in 2015. The overall
margin on new business has increased, broadly in line with the growth in new business
and stood at GBP73.8 million. In our outlook statement today, we've indicated the
potential for growth in new business in the second half of around 20%, and this should,
for modeling purposes, mean that the margin on new business in the second half also
grows by approximately 20%, compared to the second half of 2020.
Controllable overheads grouped together on this slide, reduced by 3%. It's important to
note, however, that the operating environment has impacted on the phasing of expenses
in 2021, and the full year outcome is still planned to be in line with the commitment that
we set out in February. For your models, you should still assume 5% controllable cost
growth for 2021.
Putting aside this, phasing of expenses, we made a good start to the cycle of investment
that, Ian Mackenzie, outlined at the Capital Markets event, with a number of areas of
focus, including the launch of Salesforce within the Partnership, and the development of
our Next Generation Client Experience. Beyond that, we've also launched OPAL across
the Partnership, which is a goals-based planning tool, that helps advisers support clients in
defining and prioritizing their financial goals. All of these projects will support a superior
partner and clients experience, and make SJP easier to do business with.
As we look to the second half, we have plans for further work on intelligent automation,
on decommissioning peripheral legacy systems, as well as making further headway on our
Salesforce roll-out.

FINAL

Net investments in Asia is lower by GBP4.3 million, and this reflects good cost control,
stronger markets and stronger flows, which were up by some 20%. This marks a further
step towards breakeven in 2025. And in your models, you should assume a net
investment for the year of approximately GBP14 million, which will be 20% improved on
2020, and will be in line with the path to breakeven, that Iain Rayner set out at the Capital
Markets event.
Net investments in DFM is lower by GBP0.5 million. DFM has also benefited from strong
gross inflows, up by 33%, and an increase in funds under management to GBP3.2 billion.
At the same time, we've continued to invest substantially in futureproofing DFM
operations. We've now agreed a deal to outsource our DFM back office to SS&C, which
will be a game changer for this part of our business.
Further investments is planned over the next 18 months, which will influence the shape of
the path to breakeven in 2024. But this is within the plan, and the expected outcome for
2021 is expected to be approximately GBP10 million with a similar amount for 2022. We
will then see a sharp reduction in the net cost in 2023.

Bloomberg Transcript

Taking all of this into account, the underlying cash result for the first half was GBP189.3
million, up some 65% half-on-half . If you ignore the outcome in 2020 as an exception, this
represents compound growth of around 23% since the first half of 2019, which shows
there's no sign of 2020 having impacted on our long-term growth trajectory.
The restructuring cost below the line of GBP9 million is the full charge for the year. And
this, together with reversing variances takes our total cash result to GBP175.8 million.
That's up by 41%.
I'll just pause here to mention the FSCS levy, which continues to be very high, and a real
source of frustration for all adviser firms that work hard to do the right thing for their
clients. Although, there's no sign of any short-term improvement here, we are,
nonetheless encouraged by the attention this is receiving at the FCA. And we welcome
their commitment to reduce the cost in the medium- to long-term.
I'll turn now to the embedded value, and there are a number of noteworthy impacts on
the result for the first half. Firstly, in recognition of the fact that over time we've been
keeping business on the books for longer-than-anticipated within our modeling, we've
reviewed our persistency assumptions. As a result, we've booked a positive assumption
change of approximately GBP250 million. Our revised assumptions remain prudent, but
now reflect the gradual lengthening of contract duration that we've seen over the past
few years, as highlighted by a steady stream of positive experience variances that we've
been reporting.
Secondly, our EEV new business margin increased from GBP365.3 million to GBP525.6.
This increase is primarily driven by a higher new business volumes but there's also a
positive gearing effect as a result of lower expense growth. Added to this, is the benefit
of longer estimated investment lives.

FINAL

Finally, you'll see that since embedded value is a forward-looking statement, we've made
an adjustment to reflect the effect of the tax rate change or the opening position, and this
amounted to GBP408.5 million. We've also reflected the new rate in the operating profit
after tax for the year, and this has amounted to an additional amount of around GBP50
million, which is in the main tax charge shown.
Taking all of this into account, the EEV net asset value per share at the 30 of June stood
at GBP15.31. That's up 20% from the same point in 2020. And it's worth remembering that
this doesn't take account of the additional embedded value of around GBP400 million
that falls outside the current contract boundaries, and doesn't, therefore, get included. If
it was, this would amount to an additional GBP0.74 per share.
Turning to capital. Given the simplicity of our business model and our prudent approach to
capital management, our capital position remained strong. Our reported ratio has been
somewhat distorted by the effect of the equity dampener over the past 18 months, which
has little bearing on a unit-linked business such as SJP. Fundamentally, however, the
structure and resilience of the business model means that we remain and we'll continue
to be in a strong position.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning finally to the dividend. Back in February, we announced a simplification of the way
in which we plan for interims, and these are now set at an amount equal to 30% of the
prior year full dividend. In line with this approach, the Board has declared a dividend of
GBP0.1155 per share or 30% of the total dividend for 2020 of GBP0.3849 per share.
Well, that's it on the results. Overall, this was not only a strong first half for new business,
but also a strong first half generally, for the delivery of our financial results. A good start to
2021 that shows the business is in great shape and it bodes well for the full year.
With that, I'll hand back to Andrew.

Andrew Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Thank you, Craig. Strong gross inflows, strong retention, and strong expense discipline,
combining to drive a strong financial performance. These results show, we have made an
encouraging start on our journey to achieving those ambitious strategic goals.
But what is the outlook? Well, let's start by considering the remainder of 2021.
The pandemic, the various lockdowns and changes in investor sentiment have had a
profound impact on the timing and value of flows in 2020, and in the first half of 2021. This
will naturally result in a variable pattern of year-on-year growth and normal phasing of
business.
Taking this into account, together with a strong start to July, we anticipate growth in gross
inflows of around 20% in the second half, despite strengthening comparatives in the latter
part of that year.

FINAL

Looking further ahead, we remain convinced that the market for trusted financial advice
continues to grow, whilst at the same time, there remains an adviser gap to meet this
growing demand. Through the Partnership, we are ideally-placed to take advantage of
this situation.
The Partnership continues to grow. There's a strong pipeline of industry-experienced
recruits and 277 individuals training in are well-established Academy. We also consider
there to be considerable scope for continued growth in productivity; all bode well for the
future.
However, our progress will not be linear. It's important to remember, as I said back in
February, and to repeat, there will, of course, be years, when new business is better or
perhaps behind the medium-term target.

Bloomberg Transcript

As we progress through our planning horizon to 2025, it's important to measure success
on a cumulative basis, rather than discrete months, quarters or years. And what do I mean
here? Well, let's take gross inflows. If we were to achieve our 10% annual growth goal in a
linear manner, then the cumulative goal year-on-year would look like this: to achieve 10%
growth in 2021, we would need gross inflows of GBP15.7 billion, the bottom segment of
the column on the slide; then as we go forward, we would see a further 10% increase in
gross inflows, in each of the subsequent years, providing for cumulative flow objective for
the five-year period of around GBP96 billion. It really doesn't matter how we get there.
Any variation from year-to-year is second order. Although, of course, the strong first half
performance is an encouraging start and increases our confidence.
Now, I will finish with a summary of the results, which you can see on the current slide. A
very pleasing, strong operating and financial performance by our business that is in great
shape. And as demonstrated by these results, the combination of achieving our goals,
together with that increasing emergence of cash, from funds in gestation, means, we will
deliver strong growth in the underlying cash result, and consequently return to
shareholders.
That's it. Thank you for your attention. And as a reminder, the live Q&A starts at 9:30 a.m.

Thank you, Nadia, and good morning everyone. Welcome to the Q&A part of this
morning's announcement. Now we set out our clear objectives back in February and we
hosted the in-depth Capital Markets event in May. Clearly, we're really pleased that we've
made a very encouraging start to meeting those objectives in the first six months, and

Good morning, Andrew.

Q - Andrew Sinclair

{BIO 17749036 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Well done, really good results. Today, the business
really seems in great shape. Three from me as usual, if that's okay. Firstly, just on cash
new business margin in percentage terms. Last year, I think I was a bit depressed because
expenses were being spread across less new business than planned. We didn't seem to
see a big pickup in the new business margin in percentage terms this year. Looks like flat
year-on-year. Just wondered if you could get a little of that color on this and what we
should see in terms of going forward in business margin, in percentage terms.
And the second is looking a little bit further forwards in terms of the tax rate change that
will be coming in 2023. Insurance tax accounting figure is always pretty difficult for us to
interpret, really wondered if you can give us any idea of what the impact that will be in
both in terms of the new business margin and also that 63 -- 65 bps margin on mature
from over the next few years.
And thirdly, just on recruitment where I thought the figures were super impressive, just
really wondering if you can talk a little bit about the pipeline at the moment and further
you're seeing a boost from advisors re-evaluating models after the turmoil of COVID,
looking to join showing the support that someone like STJ can give them.

A - Andrew Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Okay. So let me pick up on the recruitment one first, and ask Peter to come in and support
me. Look, we're very pleased with the start on the recruitment, and will always use
opportunities to recruit high quality advisors, and you know we're six months into our fiveyear plan.
So, our objective is still to grow new business by 10% per anum, supported by experience
recruitment, supported by the academy and supported by productivity. But as you say, it's
an encouraging start, particularly with the 277 individuals currently in the academy. But I

Page 8 of 25

might just hand over to Pete just to talk about what we're seeing at that sort of (inaudible).

Hi, Andrew can you hear me?

A - Andrew Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Yep. We can hear you now.

A - Peter Edwards

{BIO 20875780 <GO>}

Yeah. Sorry, hi. Thank you, Andrew. Yeah, with regards to the question around advisors
having a look at the models and making decisions about their future, those of which are
currently industry professional, so to speak. I think that is normal, that's something that
advisory businesses would do on an ongoing basis. I think the pipeline for existing industry
professionals is very strong.
Our selection criteria, as you will know, is high. We take a great deal of care with the
people that we bring into the partnership, but we're very confident that the blend that we
have, all people who are existing industry professionals alongside the academy, will help
us achieve our medium-term growth target. So, yeah, lots of people reassessing their
situation, but that is normal in financial services.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Andrew Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Thanks, Pete. And the first two questions, I'm going to hand over to Craig, very much the
financial ones. Yeah. So, there were two there. One was on the new business margin. As
we said before, this is a margin that has two key inputs as all margins do, costs and
income, but the relationship between those isn't linear. So we do have an element of
fixed cost within that and you're quite right as business came under pressure in 2019 and
2020, it did more to reveal some of those fixed costs.
We also have what you might describe as a semi-variable cost, say for instance,
performance-related bonus schemes might fall into that category. So, you've actually got
quite a mix of income and expense. The key thing that happened in the current period is
that we clearly benefited from 27% growth, and that's driven an increase in the value of
new business margin of about GBP13 million, and it just so happens that it has moved
broadly in line with the growth in new business, but the net effects of all of those moving
parts mean that the actual margin itself has stayed fairly constant.
It is worth saying that even if you take accounts of some of the ebbing and flowing of the
margin, we're talking about relatively small numbers in the cash result and I think that's
what we're going to see in the future. The guidance, I would offer for the second half in
our outlook statement, we've said that we believe growth in gross inflows of around 20%
half year on half year is realistic. And therefore, what I would say for the second half is that
we should assume that the new business margin, half on half increases by 20% in terms
of the value that that will deliver. But it is a margin that will ebb and flow in the future,
Page 9 of 25



Company N ame: St James' s Place PL C
Company Ticker: STJ L N Equity
Date: 2021-07-28

because it's not linear. But I wouldn't expect much deviation from where we are at the
moment.

Q - Andrew Sinclair

{BIO 17749036 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Thanks.

A - Andrew Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

And the second question, Andy was on the tax rate change. I'd be the first one to agree
with you on the complexity of life accounting, but the good news is when it's -- when it's a
fixed input, such as the rate of corporation tax, although there will be some complexity
and it won't be a perfect adjustment if you just look at the change of the rates of
corporation tax. Broadly speaking, if you just take the differential and apply it to each of
the line items within the cash results, you will pretty much be there.

Bloomberg Transcript

We're going to put something on the website later today, which brings that to life, and
there will be no rocket science in there. It will be pretty, pretty intuitive, but that would be
my starting point in terms of working out what the future of the cash result holds. For
those people on the call to follow embedded value, obviously, because that's a forwardlooking statement, you have to incorporate known changes at the points at which they're
substantively enacted and that is the case with this tax rate change.
See, what you will see is that we've made an adjustment to what you might call the
opening position in the embedded value, but we've also put an additional tax charge in to
reflect the high rate of tax that will be in place as some of the value that's being created
actually arises in the embedded value. And again, that's all within the report, but we'll
make that clearer on the slide that goes onto the website later. So I think the good news,
if there is good news attached to this, is that the impact will be relatively simple to model.

Q - Andrew Sinclair

{BIO 17749036 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks. Very helpful. (multiple speakers) very much.

A - Andrew Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Thank you, Andrew. Nadia, could we have the next question, please?

Yes. Thank you, Andrew. Our next question comes from Colm Kelly from UBS. Colm,
please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Colm Kelly

{BIO 19140684 <GO>}

Thanks very much, and again, well done on the results today. And just, first question on
business mix. I think the first half, we saw higher proportion of ISA, unit trust, or investment
business, relative to pension business that we've seen in recent periods and that's always
important, because it becomes -- it generates more assets that are more cash generative
straight away.
Page 10 of 25

FINAL

In terms of our product mix, that's just something you feel it will fluctuate from period-toperiod, the balance between pensions and other products, or within the growth targets
that you have to 2025. Do you have different expected rates of growth on those product
lines, such that we should expect to see some sort of mix effect continuing into the
future? And that's the first question.
Just a second question on solvency, and don't think there would be a Q&A session if it's
not going to involve solvency, just a live operating entity solvency was 119%, which is well
above the target of 110%. You do mention though that there's a management action
taken in the first half, related to the modeling of market risk capital. I'm just wondering if
you could explain that in a little bit more detail, what the change is there? And also how
big an impact or benefit did that have on the life solvency ratio in the first half ? Thanks a
lot.

A - Andrew Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Thank Colm. And I'll take the business mix point and then hand over to Craig on the
solvency. And just, -- let's talk about the 2025 role for a minute. We're not targeting
specific business mixes, because it really is an advice business and the business mix will
be driven by the advice. Clearly, over the last five or six years, we've seen a bigger swing
towards pensions, and this year we've just seen more ISA business in the first quarter, and
you will always see more ISA business in the first quarter.
I would say there is an element this year of people putting more money into ISA, because
they had more savings. But we kind of expect the business mix to stay more or less the
same throughout the planning environment, unless there's changes to legislation,
changes to regulation, changes to the advice. So hopefully, it helps over to the solvency,
great.

A - Craig Gordon Gentle

{BIO 20095126 <GO>}

Yeah, thanks Colm. It's always difficult to keep Solvency II question-and-answer brief, isn't
it, but I'll do my best. Principally, the management action lies in the fact that whenever you
go down the routes of setting up a whole series of Solvency II standard formula model,
you make certain assumptions around what happens, for example, in the end -- in the
event of a 40% equity downturn and it's one of the various stress tests that you have to
perform.
When we first put together our Solvency II, we made various assumptions which I would
say were prudence assumptions, but enabled us to work through the Solvency II data in a
straightforward manner, but we always knew would have resulted in, if you like a slightly
more hair shirted answer, than would actually reveal itself in the event of a 40% downturn.
And one example, might be the use of derivatives across our investment management's
approach, which are there to provide for certain outcomes if the markets do behave in
that way, and the important thing with all of this is to end up in a situation where you can
point to one of those tests, that is what actually would happen and what we did with the
benefit of better data, because as time goes on, there's always better data. I think
Bluedoor has a role to play in that, for us in providing us with that sort of granular data.

FINAL

We're able to take a more sophisticated approach and actually take advantage and take
the benefit of some of those things that perhaps in the past we haven't, and that's work
that's been ongoing, preparation for that was during the course of 2020, and the benefit
has been booked in 2021.
In terms of quantum, I would say, it's not a sizable as the sort of volatility that the Equity
Dampener offers, but it has resulted in a few percentage points of improvements in that
ratio, and that's something I would expect to hold.
One of the reasons we did this is really very much linked with the reason why there -there's plenty of consideration of Solvency II at the moment. What we've seen over the
last two years is quite a lot of volatility coming out of the standard formula, that means
that this sort of activity has greater value.

Q - Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Good morning, all. A couple of questions from me. Firstly, I think, historically you talked
about the business -- business coming from SME's from people selling their businesses
and then investing with you. I just wondered where we are on that cycle, in terms of the
recovery from lockdowns, whether you're beginning to see material amount of business
coming from people selling business or whether that's still up the line.
And then secondly, I think you talked about 277 people in the academy. I think if you go
back over time, you had up to 400 people in the academy. Is there an intention to build
the academy to a bigger number?

A - Andrew Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you, Andrew. I'll answer both those, and perhaps ask Peter to come in and
support me on the academy again.
As far as SMEs are concerned, you are correct, we do work with SMEs when they sell their
business, because they're growing their businesses, is their retirements so to speak. And
when they sell the business, they're looking for that financial planning for their retirement.
There hasn't been much of that in the last two years, because of Brexit and obviously
COVID. There's certainly indications that more activity is around with respect to that.

They tend to be I mean that's not masses and masses of these cases, but they tend to
be large, sort of one-offs coming in from time to time, and when I say large one-offs,
usually sort of 15 to 30 million, something along those lines. But definitely more sense for
the people that are getting back into that sort of selling their business.
In terms of the academy, obviously, last year we suspended the academy which would
have reduced the number, but what we've been able to do is use COVID as a big sort of
learning lesson in terms of how the academy works, and there's a lot more online if you
like, which means that the academy that used to be a series of places in London,
Manchester, and it's adding (inaudible). We're now able to reach across the whole of the
UK, because it can be done online. And at that point, I might just ask to -- Pete, just to

Yeah, thank you, Andrew. So, the way we adapted and I made reference to this at the
Capital Market's Day, the way we have adapted the training of the students in the
academy has led to a blended approach of face-to-face training and virtual, as Andrew
has alluded to. We do have a number of people in training at the moment as you said, it's
about 277. However, we have intakes throughout Page 2 of this year and into H1 of next
year, lined up in that free training engagement phase. So, we will see the numbers of
academy students and then academy graduates increase over time, but one of the things
we are very conscious of is taking our time with the growth of the academy to get back up
to full speed, as the country emerges from lockdown and we're more able to do things
face-to-face.

the proportion of flows that came from new clients versus existing clients in the first half ?
And how does this compare with like the normalized level that you see? I'm just trying to
get a feel of how well advisors have done in the first half for attracting new clients? And
then a question on inflation. How confident are you on the 5% growth in control of the
Page 13 of 25



Company N ame: St James' s Place PL C

expenses after 2021, even given the outlook for inflation that we're seeing? And then
finally, a question on strategy. And in particular, on your proposition aimed at women
specifically. I read somewhere that 53% of UK millionaires will be female by 2025, how
well placed is (inaudible) to serve this growing segment of the market? Thanks.

FINAL

A - Andrew Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you, Louise. I'll probably take the proportion of flows and the diversity
question, and ask Craig to pick up the inflation question on expenses. In terms of the
proportion of flows, these are very round numbers and nothing's really changed over the
over the years. But what you tend to find is about 50% of flows come from existing
clients, and that's people on their financial journey, if you like to retirement or inheritance.
35% to 40% will come from introductions and referrals from existing clients and then the
balance comes from other marketing client acquisition, if you like, initiatives.

Bloomberg Transcript

Nothing has much really changed over the years. I don't think too much has changed
recently other than those last year, those other marketing initiatives that might be a
seminar about inheritance tax, because of the social distancing, they clearly -- we weren't
able to have those. But it's small in terms of the sort of size of the numbers that we're
talking about now. Very, very good question on diversity. So, thank you for that.
Now being a face-to-face advice business, there is no doubt that the people bond and
transact with similar types of people, and so if we want to get more female wealth if you
like, then ultimately we will need more female advisors. Now in terms of recruiting
experienced advisors, there's a finite pool there, but this is where the academy comes
into play and there's no reason why the academy cannot be producing 50% female, 50%
male. And equally across all categories of diversity, and that's the (Technical Difficulty).

A - Craig Gordon Gentle

{BIO 20095126 <GO>}

The inflation question?

A - Andrew Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Craig Gordon Gentle

{BIO 20095126 <GO>}

Yes. Thanks, Louise. I would say that the start point to the answer of that question is that
I'm certainly not planning any change in guidance, based on what we see on inflation at
the moment. There's that killer question out there, is this short-term or long-term. We've
planned on the basis that we've planned.
The other thing I would throw in there is that yes, there's inflation, but also as we increase
our scale, we have better purchasing power and that is something we've experienced. So,
we've got clear plans, we got a clear financial envelope and I'm not planning on any
change of that guidance at the moment. If God forbid, we end up in an hyperinflationary
environment, then there may be another conversation. But as we see things at the
moment, the plan is the plan.

Your line is open.

Q - Andrew Baker

{BIO 3694545 <GO>}

Hi, everyone, and thanks for taking my questions. So, just two left for me, please. First one
is on retention. So, I understand you're confident in the retention outlook, but I don't
believe that includes withdrawals. So, are you including or are you expecting any structural
increase in the withdrawal rate over the longer term as your customer base ages? Or are
you adding enough younger clients to offset it?

Bloomberg Transcript

And then just secondly on the controllable expense. I know, you sort of reiterated the 5%
growth in 2021. Previously, given sort of underpinning this was (inaudible) establishment
expense growth, 25% growth in operational and strategic development costs, and 15% in
academy expenses. Is there any change to this view based on sort of what you've seen in
the first half ? Thank you.

A - Andrew Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Yeah, I'll ask Craig, just to pick up the expense question first, then.

A - Craig Gordon Gentle

{BIO 20095126 <GO>}

Yes. Put simply, there's no change. The point we're making is that half year, the impact of
the operating environment has had an impact on phasing. But the guidance we put out at
the beginning of the year remains very much in place and for anyone who has that hand,
we pull together a table within the slide deck back in February, setting out what we
expected the outcome to be on controllable expenses. And I would still assume that
that's the case in any modeling you do for the remainder of 2021.

A - Andrew Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Thank you, Craig. And in terms of the withdrawals, again a great question. Thank you,
Andrew. So, there's two answers to it, short-term and a longer-term answer.
If I do the short-term first, what we saw sort of roundabout, July-August last year was
people reducing the income that they were taking from their plans, because quite simply
they weren't spending it. So, therefore, you saw a pickup or a reduction in withdrawals.
We expect that to -- that's going to reverse back to where it was previously. So that's the
short-term one. And clearly, as people enter into a time, and they're going to be taking
Page 15 of 25



Company N ame: St James' s Place PL C
Company Ticker: STJ L N Equity
Date: 2021-07-28

withdrawals from pension plans, et cetera, but the advantage of being a growth business,
like ours, is that we're constantly adding a greater number of flows going in each year
from younger clients. So, therefore, it's not shifting the dial at all. I hope that sort of makes
sense.

Operator
Yes. So our next question comes from Oliver Steel from Deutsche Bank. Oliver, please go
ahead. Your line is open

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Oliver Steel

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

Hi, there. Three questions from me. And the first notwithstanding what you said in your
presentation, Andrew, is really about the (inaudible) flows from here. I mean June in
particular, was an enormous month relative, and even if I go back to 2019, to go back to
some sort of normalized year, you had, I think 39% or 34% growth. I can't even read my
own writing, (inaudible) growth, June 2019 to June 2021. And how much both sort of A and
B on that one? How much, given that you're going for only 20% growth in the second half
of the year, you're clearly expecting significant slowdown in the growth rate versus the
2019 in the second half of the year.
So, I'm just sort of trying to sort of work out here on how much of the sort of exceptional
surge we've seen and how much is still out there in the future. And then I suppose, the
part B question is, if we do issue 17.7 [ph] billion net flows in the full year (inaudible) only
with guidance. Is that a sustainable number? Is that a number you can grow from next
year?
Second question, rather more quickly is turning back to Colm's cons question about ISA
and Unit Trust growth. That -- I mean, that's basically been sort of minimal growth over the
last three years, and suddenly we're seeing the surge. Is that element of the first half
growth perhaps where we see the most exceptional element? Is that where we're sort of
-- is that where there's basically being a sort of holding back of cash, as of the last 12
months, which was then just like a surge into the flows in the first half of this year.
And then the third question, I've got is about academy productivity. So something like half
of the net increase in agents came from the academy as far as I can work out in the first
half. And it's pretty important I guess to understand the academy's productivity. So the
question I've got is, the big guidance you definitely experience you gave us in 2018 in that
Investor Day about academy graduate productivity, beating average productivity. Year five
or six, I think it was. Does that show -- does that still hold true or if not, how has it
changed?

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

FINAL

I suspect, I'm going to be picking up all these questions. I can see a big smile on Craig's
face though. So, there you go. Let's do the academy productivity first. But nothing has
changed, from sort of 2018 guidance. It takes people a little bit longer understandably,
because they're establishing a business, they need to build a client bank, but after four or
five years, they tend to cross over. But two other points fit in there, Oliver.
Firstly, is the sort of two strands to the academy that we've always spoken about. One is
next generation. So, next generation will be sons and daughters, nephews and nieces
working in a existing business. And then the second one is people establishing their own
business. And I think we're mainly talking there about people who established their own
business.
And then the other really important point is the average age is a good 10, 12 years
younger than, might be even a bit more than that, than an experienced recruit. So, the
economic value these individuals will add, will probably be for a longer period of time. So,
hopefully, that answers that one. On the ISA and Unit Trust growth rate, I mean, a couple
of things there and again it was probably 2018, I forget the dates now, but George
Osborne increased the ISA allowance by 33%, and then it stayed flat since then.

Bloomberg Transcript

So historically, what you would always seen is the ISA business as a minimum would be
growing as the ISA allowance went up. So that's been some of the challenge over the last
couple of years. There was no doubt in my mind, that people have put more into their ISA
this year, because they've not been spending the money, which I think feeds into your first
question.
And I want to go back to what I said in my presentation, is that the pandemic has really
thrown up in the air, normal business patterns and comparatives. It's dangerous in my view
to compare percentage growth with periods of the pandemic. If we look at the remainder
of the year, then the third quarter is -- I don't like to use the word, but I will to sort of
softer comparative of the year, and we've said that we got off to a good start in July, but
then the fourth quarter is we started seeing business picking up in the fourth quarter.
So that's why we believe 20% is the right number. That isn't what we're targeting. If we
can do 25, we'll do 25 in that situation. So how can (multiple speakers)

Q - Oliver Steel

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

Can I -- Can I just come back to you on that one though, because I was comparing the
numbers to 2019, so pre-pandemic. Your June figure is up 39% versus June 2019. Your
guidance of second half is up 9% or 10% of the second half '19. So I'm just wondering, are
your numbers just exceptionally conservative? Or is there sort of something exceptional in
the first half that we should be aware of ?

A - Andrew Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

I think there's definitely that pent-up demand in the first half. I mean, if you look at the first
quarter this year, it was up 18% on the first quarter last year, that wasn't lockdown, sort of

Q - Gregory Simpson

{BIO 18850594 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning. I just want to talk to a broad question on COVID and productivity. So
productivity advisor has returned back to H1 2018 levels, but I'm just wondering what's
your sense on the current COVID impact on advisors, presumably there's still not many
face-to-face meetings going on, but it seems like advisors are quite well adapted to
seeing clients virtually and maybe that allows them to have a broader client really.
So the basic question, do you think productivity is still being held back by a lack of face-toface meetings or not so much? That's the first question. And just secondly, quickly on
DFM, you mentioned, contracting DFM for outsourcing and it sounds like that's an
important (inaudible) for reaching past break-even. Just to check with 2023, that you
expect the impact on the cash results to be visible and is it something that's quite
straightforward to implement that you have that existing relationship with (inaudible).
Thanks.

A - Andrew Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Yeah, I'll pick up the productivity, and pass over the DFM question to Craig. Look,
productivity is always an interesting one isn't it, and I'm going to refer back to what Peter
Ed was saying at the Capital Market. We see plenty of scope for increased productivity
going forward, partly because as you sort of pointed out there Greg, people are able to
use more online stuff, making it easier for us to do business.
I don't get any sense of productivity as being how bad this particular point in time, by
people not being able to meet, and indeed there are being plenty of face-to-face
meetings in a socially distanced way, probably over the last quarter. But again we feel very
strongly, some great scope for productivity gains in the future. Craig, do you want to do
the DFM?

FINAL

Yeah. So I mean, I use the expression game-changer, and I really think it is. What you might
see as one of the final areas of substantial investments, and the reason we're doing it is
what we have at the moment is a business that essentially has the same back office and
IT systems as it did when we made the acquisition. So this time is always going to come.
You're quite right, I think you used the expression sort of tried and tested with SS&C. And
boy, has that been tried and tested, as we went into lockdown and went through one of
the most challenging operating environments, you can imagine. So we're very clear that
we've got the right partner here and we're very clear that they've got the right back office
infrastructure for us to use. And this is really about future scalability and efficiency.
And it just so happens, as the cost surpasses through and for that reason, having started
and having planned to get the job done over a sort of 18-month time horizon, I would
expect the DFM result to be somewhere in the region of net investments of 10 billion for
'21 and '22, but because that then -- that period of investment comes to a sharp closed,
you should then see in '23, a sharp reversal of that towards break-even in 2024. So
absolutely no change to the break-even point that we talked about at the Capital Markets
Event.

Q - Larissa van Deventer

{BIO 21570130 <GO>}

Thank you. Just one quick question from me on Solvency II, you reported a ratio of 119%,
recognizing that cases business was very different to your typical life insurance. Can you
give us some color on how you think about the levels where the ratio should be? And
what's the risk of (inaudible) being more severe than those that you model?

A - Peter Edwards

{BIO 20875780 <GO>}

It's my turn to smile at Craig.
Okay. I'll take that up. So you're right. So, in the first instance, it's always slightly dangerous
to compare solvency ratios between different life companies, because different business
models will carry with them difference inherent risks and I would assert that we're at the
lower end of that risk spectrum, because we're basically asset-backed and unit-linked.
So the risk that we think about as we work out, what's an appropriate ratio is, is
operational risk. And all of the work we do is all geared towards scenarios that could result
Page 19 of 25



Company N ame: St James' s Place PL C
Company Ticker: STJ L N Equity
Date: 2021-07-28

FINAL

in some kind of operational stress and we often talk about a management solvency
buffer. And the reason we think about that is it's very important to turn complexity into
reality, and the reality is that as aboard on a life company, you have to figure out how
much cash you want? How much reserve do you want? And, of course, liquidity within that,
in order to solve a problem. And the problem that you're solving comes out of all of the
scenario planning that you do and you are essentially come up with a lump of assets that
is there to be deployed.
What we then do is think of that in the context of the Solvency II regime, and that's what's
driven us to a conclusion over the years, which again is tried and tested at a 110% is the
level that we would seek not to go below, which is lower than you'll see in another life
companies. But you would be comparing that with other life companies that carries
substantial risk.
The other thing that's just worth flagging is that this isn't the only thing you have to have
on your dashboard in front of you. So as well as the Solvency II measure, obviously,
because you always have to think about liquidity, and then you have to think about IFRS.
And we had a number of conversations at this time, back in February, around the dividend
guidance, where we thought very long and hard about the long-term impact that IFRS has,
and that resulted in a deduction of a different dividend payout ratio. So all of that is in
front of you, but basically, 110% is the number that we live with under Solvency II.

FINAL

A - Andrew Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Yeah. Okay Fine. Let me pick up the competitive landscape first, and I think you're
absolutely right, there's a lot of interest in this space. Quite rightly so, because it's
incredibly exciting space to be operating in and you heard us talk before about, there
being 10 million individuals in the UK marketplace, in our marketplace.
You've heard us talk about there being the advice gap. You would hear us talking about
the complexity of the rules, the need for advice and you would have heard us talk about
the very large intergenerational transfer wealth, sort of occurring in the UK. That's why it's
a very exciting market and why there's lots of people interested in this space.

Bloomberg Transcript

You know, we are one of the market leaders, so I think we're in a great space to continue
to expand in that marketplace. In terms of the DFM, I'm going to pass you over to Craig
again. Yeah, the plan for DFM is organic growth. When we made the acquisition, the plan
at that stage was always for organic growth and that's proving to be a very successful
strategy.
It's always inadvisable to say never in these situations. And so I would never say never. If
we found that there was a small opportunity that was just too good to refuse, I think we
would owe it to everyone, to give that due consideration. But I think the other criteria that
would have to be met in that situation, if it arose, it would also have to be pretty modest,
and the reason for that is that we already have a successful formula for growth that we're
applying. So I think what I would assume for planning purposes is that this is not an
acquisition strategy, but if something came along, that it was just too good to turn down.
We would clearly feel obliged to have a look at least.

saving in the second half, specifically from the development costs. I know that there's

FINAL

Yes. Thank you, Rhea. But the -- the way to think about this. We've got very ambitious
plans for investment improvements in growth. But within our controllable overheads,
we've set a very clear financial envelope, and that's the financial envelope that grows by
5% a year. So the simple answer to your question as to what you can expect in 2022, is a
5% increase on the total cost for 2021, which itself will be 5% ahead of the total cost in
2020, because that's the envelope that we're working within. And it's that envelope that
we have insight as we commit to the plans that we're in the process of committing to.
But the phasing point is simply and you sort of hope this is more a feature of 2020 and
2021. When you find yourself in lockdown conditions, the good news is it hasn't obviously
impacted the topline, but it does speed -- it does impact on the speed of execution,
particularly of projects, but we do expect to catch up with that in the second half. So, we
expect that envelope to right itself during the course of this year. So put simply, the
guidance that we put out at the beginning of the year, which projected into 2022 remains
very much in place.

Of course. Our next question comes from Steven Haywood from HSBC. Steven, please
go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Good morning, everybody. And just following up actually on the
previous question. Could you remind me of guidance and your strategic development
costs, and they seem obviously low in the first half of this year. Do you see them back
them backend loaded in the second half ?
And then, secondly, from me, you've had a significant change in your persistency
assumption with embedded value. Can you talk about whether this sort of assumption is
now in line with your current experience? Or are you still being somewhat conservative on
your assumption? And this is taking to account, using regular withdrawals, the surrenders
and maturities, and taking into account all of the money leaving your funds. I noticed that
obviously, you always provide your retention rate, excluding the regular withdrawals and
surrenders. Why is this -- this is part of the ongoing nature of the business. I just wonder
why you would exclude these from your retention rate? Thanks.

A - Andrew Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Okay, I might just pick up those aspects, just from a historical point of view. So, the way
the embedded values working, if you look at the withdrawal rates, the withdrawal rates
are assumed in the embedded value calculation for the new business profit, et cetera, et
cetera. So that's why it's logical to map the attention that we talk about to the calculation
of the embedded value.

Your other questions were around expenses and the change. So, I'll hand back to Craig.

FINAL

A - Craig Gordon Gentle

{BIO 20095126 <GO>}

Yeah. So, I go back to the guidance actually, because you're right. Strategic development
costs are lower than you might have modeled for the half-year, but the point we're
making here is that that will catch up in the second half. And I think for simple modeling
purposes, the best way to think about this is the way we've structured the guidance,
which is to lump them all together and think of them on a combined basis as controllable
overheads.
And if you assume that year-on-year, those controllable overheads will go up by 5%. You
will have the right overall number in your model, for the year. When we pull together the
guidance, we said that there would be a 25% increase in operational developments, and
we also combined with that strategic developments, and that's the basis on which we are
going to be reporting at the end of the year. So that 25% increase on GBP 42 million in
2020, would take you up to about GBP 53 million, and I think that's what we're saying, you
should expect to see on a combined basis at the end of the year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to the assumption change and embedded value, you've used the word
conservative. I would use the word prudence, because prudence is a requirement when
you produce an embedded value. What you don't want to be doing, is changing these
things year in, year out.
So what you would have observed in our embedded value over the years is a stream of
positive -- positive variances. And that's usually indicative of being on the right side of
prudence within the embedded value. So, I would say what it does, is it takes account of
everything we've seen over the past few years. You don't pick on any particular year So,
for example, 2020, we would have had very strong experience, but that may not be
sustainable.
What we've done is we've looked at it over a very long period of time and concluded that
now is the right time to change the assumptions that go into the embedded value. And all
of this is geared towards what an actuary would call a best estimate, but within that best
estimate, there is always a degree of prudence, because that is essentially a requirement.

Good morning. Thanks for taking the second question. It's a point of clarification, actually.
On page 20 of your results, you say that the funds in gestation will contribute about GBP
22.2 million to the 2021 result, as they come out of gestations, earning a fee. And then in
the slide, you said that there was about GBP 20 million benefit to net income in the third
half due to maturing gestation plan. I might conclude, therefore, the benefits in the
second half will be GBP 2.2 million.

A - Unidentified Speaker
I'll take that. No, no, that's not the case, Andrew. Because if you think about the disclosure
here, what we're saying is for the remainder of 2021, there will be an additional GBP 22.2
million contribution and that's on top of GBP 20 million that we've already seen coming
through.

Q - Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Okay. So, it's H2 '21. Okay. Got you.

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, Andrew. So what we're saying is the little table you see there for 2021, because
we're at the half-year point, is six months. It sort of also explains the step-up to next year
and the year after that situation.
I think that probably comes to an end of the questions unless anyone's got any final
questions. If not, just to say thank you very much, for taking the time to both watch the
presentation and participate in the questions and answers. No doubt as you go through
the body of the accounts, you might have some other queries and Hugh is the first person
to contact there I think.
Now Craig and I are now both smiling at you, as we leave you there. So thank you very
much everyone, and have a good day.
