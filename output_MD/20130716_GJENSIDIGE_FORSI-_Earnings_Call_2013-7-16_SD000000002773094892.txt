{BIO 19368607 <GO>}

Welcome to this presentation of the Second Quarter results for Gjensidige. My name is
Janne Flessum and I'm Head of Investor Relations.
This time, our CEO, Helge Leiro Baastad, will present the headlines for the quarter before
our CFO, Catharina Hellerud, gives you the details on the ﬁnancials; and then we will
open for Q&A session, as always.
Then I leave the word to our CEO, Helge Leiro Baastad.

Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Thank you, Janne. Welcome to all of you.
Proﬁt before tax in the quarter was approximately NOK1.1 billion and the underwriting
result amounting to NOK448 million, corresponding to the combined ratio of 90.3%.
As you know we do not discount reserves. So discounted, it was 87.5%; and with a run-oﬀ
gain relating to other periods of only 0.6 [ph]. Adjusted for discounting and run oﬀ, it was
88.1%. Last year the Second Quarter 2012, we had a 2.3% run-oﬀ gain.

FINAL

The growth in earned premiums in the quarter was a solid 4.3% driven by a high activity
level and the general increase in premiums. And we are very satisﬁed with growth in
earned premiums. We saw signs of the claims trend returning to a more normal level in
the First Quarter compared with the extraordinary situation we experienced in 2012 when
the claims trend was unusually favorable. This trend strengthened in the Second Quarter.
For our two biggest products, motor and property, the loss ratio increased signiﬁcantly
compared with the same period last year. The property product in particular showed a
relatively weaker development, among other things, due to ﬂooding and precipitation.
The development was particularly weak at the beginning of the quarter, while towards the
end of the period, we saw claims levels more in line with the strong levels we have seen
during the last quarters. But the long-term trend picture is unchanged and our overall
target is still 90% to 93% in the long term.
The proportion of large losses were somewhat lower overall than in the corresponding
quarter last year, although it ended at the level close to what we expect as normal in the
quarter. The ﬂood we experienced in Norway in May had a negative eﬀect on the General
Insurance result in the amount of NOK113 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

Costs still developed satisfactorily. And we had a cost ratio of 15.3% in the quarter. The
ﬁnancial result amounted to NOK605 million, which corresponds to a return on ﬁnancial
assets of 1.1%.
The lending growth in the Bank continued with true [ph] force in the Second Quarter and
ended at 34.2% on an annualized basis. The Bank has shown -- developed positively over
time. And it also delivered excellent results in the Second Quarter at NOK43 million. And
this is 60% up on last year.
The annualized return on equity before tax expense was 13.1% year to date. And it was
aﬀected, as you will remember, by the impairment loss of NOK611 million on Storebrand
in First Quarter.
Then next page, as mentioned, the growth in premiums in the quarter was a solid 4.3%.
We are still experiencing good competitiveness in combination with a proﬁtability level
that is within the targets we have set ourselves.
The work of further developing our tariﬀs has high priority. This work is intended to
ensure optimal utilization of tariﬀs at the point of intersection between proﬁtability and
competitiveness.
Developing tariﬀs and related activities that ensure good customer and risk selection is a
continuous process. Scale is important in order to ensure suﬃcient focus and maintain a
leading position in the market. This applies to both the scale of our analysis data and our
capacity to build strong expertise in this area. Gjensidige is in a strong position in this
respect.

The Private segment recorded growth in premiums in the quarter of 3.3% on a par with
what we have seen over period now [ph]. We are pleased to note that the number of
customers has remained at a stable level. The growth is largely the result of higher
premiums. The Commercial segment recorded a growth in premiums of 3.2% in the
quarter. The changeover to multi-channel distribution within the Commercial segment has
resulted in a higher activity level in the segment. And this is now beginning to be
reﬂected in the reported ﬁgures as a result of the fact that one of the two big contracts we
let go last year is no longer part of the comparison basis. The growth is mainly within our
core segment which comprises small and medium sized enterprises and agriculture.
For Nordic, it is satisfying to know that the change of tempo we saw in the First Quarter is
continuing. We have been through a phase with an extensive cleanout of the portfolio.
And in the Second Quarter, the segment recorded growth of 9.2% largely driven by
growth in the Commercial portfolio.
The expanded agreement with Nykredit, as we commented after First Quarter, enables us
to communicate directly with customers and to manage the customer dialog and activity.
And we have great expectation of the eﬀects of this in the Private market in the time
ahead. The response is excellent so far. It's also nice to know that we increased
unprompted [ph] familiarity with (inaudible) in Denmark.

Bloomberg Transcript

An agreement was signed in the Second Quarter for the acquisition of Gouda Travel
Insurance. And as you have seen, it's a premium portfolio of around NOK290 million.
Breaks down as follows.
Approximately 50% in Denmark, 25% in Norway. And the remaining 25% in Sweden. We
expect this to be part of our book at the end of 2013.
This [ph] acquisition underpins the strategy for structural proﬁtable growth in the Nordic
region. And it will provide exciting opportunities in a growth niche segment in which we
are not very active at present. For Gjensidige, it is not a matter for debate. But a matter, of
course, to seek structural growth in both the Nordic countries and the Baltic states.
For the general insurance industry in Europe as a whole, it was ﬂooding that dominated
the news this quarter. Gjensidige has good experience of weather events. And our
contingency arrangements worked well in relation to our customers.
Almost 20% -- 70% of all enquiries by phone were answered within 20 seconds. We were
quickly up to speed as regards helping customers registering claims and ordering work
evaluations [ph]; and satisﬁed customer in crisis situations are important in relation to our
endorsement to be the most customer-oriented general insurance company in the Nordic
countries.
So with that last comment, I would give the word to CFO, Catharina Hellerud, to go
through the ﬁgures in more detail.

FINAL

Thank you. We are satisﬁed with the results of our operations in the quarter. And also what
we regard as an acceptable return on the Investment portfolio.
Underwriting result ended at NOK448 million, a reduction from the corresponding
quarter last year, which was a very strong quarter. As already commented, the reduction in
the result is largely due to a more normal claims trend.
In addition, the run-oﬀ gain was considerably lower this quarter, compared with the
Second Quarter last year, although this is partly contracted by a lower proportion of large
losses.
The Retail Bank continues to improve its good proﬁt performance with a proﬁt before tax
for the quarter that is 60% higher than the corresponding quarter last year. And the
continued strong volume development resulted in higher net interest income. And at the
same time, operating expenses are under good control during a period of increased
activity. Lower write-downs and losses also contributed to the positive proﬁt performance.

Bloomberg Transcript

In the beginning of July, Gjensidige Bank's long-term rating was upgraded from a BBB
plus to A minus. This is expected to bring further improvements to the ﬁnancing cost of
the Bank.
Pension and Savings are also developing in a positive direction. Together, the Bank and
Pension and Savings contribute proﬁt before tax of NOK57 million in the quarter
compared with NOK37 million in the corresponding quarter last year.
The Investment portfolio yielded a return of 1.0%, somewhat increased from 0.9% in the
corresponding quarter last year.
Taken together, this has resulted in a proﬁt before tax of NOK1.1 billion for the quarter.
Turning to page 7, the combined ratio for the General Insurance operation was 90.3% in
the quarter. And as you see, the cost ratio decreased from 15.4% to 15.3% in the quarter.
And is developing according to plan towards a cost ratio of 15% within 2015.
Helge has already given you a detailed explanation to the development in the loss ratio
and the premiums in the quarter. I will jump directly to slide 9.
As we can see on slide 9, large losses in the quarter have an eﬀect on the combined ratio
of 5.0percentage points, somewhat below the expected ﬁgure for the quarter of
5.4percentage points.
Around half of the large losses this quarter, NOK130 million, were due to the ﬂoods in
Norway in May. The part of the ﬂood claims that exceeds NOK30 million is charged to the

Page 4 of 17



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2013-07-16

corporate center which therefore had a high proportion of large losses in the quarter.
Besides the ﬂood, it is largely Commercial that is aﬀected by all the large losses in the
Second Quarter.

FINAL

The proportion of large losses were somewhat higher in the Second Quarter last year with
an eﬀect on the combined ratio of 6.3percentage points. For the ﬁrst half of 2013, the
portion of large losses was almost in line with the same period of 2012.
Turning to page 10, there was a run-oﬀ gain of NOK28 million in the quarter,
corresponding to a positive eﬀect on the combined ratio of 0.6percentage points
compared with 2.3percentage points in the Second Quarter in 2012.
All segments have low run-oﬀ gains in the quarter. But no special circumstances or trends
appear to be behind the run-oﬀ ﬁgures. The level of run-oﬀ gain is substantially lower in
2013 than in 2012, both in the Second Quarter as well as in the ﬁrst half of the year.

Bloomberg Transcript

The provisions are made based on the best estimate principle. This implies that the
expected run-oﬀ level is zero. But with technical reserves of around NOK30 billion, there
will naturally be some run-oﬀ results from quarter to quarter. During the period from
2000, run-oﬀ gains have had a positive eﬀect on the combined ratio of less than
1percentage point on average.
Turning to page 11, the nominal operating expenses increased by NOK26 [ph] million in
the quarter, corresponding to 3.8%, while the cost ratio decreased from 15.4% to 15.3% as
a result of higher grown in premiums.
There was a ﬂat development in the nominal operating expenses for most of the segment.
Part of the increase in the Nordic segment concerned non-recurring costs relating to the
implementation of the new distribution agreement with Nykredit.
In addition, the corporate center shows a small increase in the nominal operating
expenses during the period primarily related to implementation of the new re-sale [ph]
proﬁle throughout the Group, including launching of a new Internet portal in Sweden and
the rebranding of our branch oﬃces in Norway.
Year to date, normal operating expenses increased by NOK41 million primarily due to the
same eﬀect.
Turning to page 12, the internal risk-based capital requirement for the operational
segments has increased by NOK400 million during the quarter to NOK7.5 billion on a
diversiﬁed basis.
For the General Insurance segment, the capital requirement has only a marginal increase
by NOK100 million in all. Most of the increase is due to increased capital requirement for

Page 5 of 17



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2013-07-16

the Commercial segment.

FINAL

The biggest increase in the operational capital requirement comes from the Bank, where
the capital requirement increased by NOK300 million. This is the result of growth
combined with higher requirements for the Bank's core capital that applied from July 1,
2013.
We have taken this into account in the ﬁgures by increasing the targeted capital for the
Bank from 12%, which we used earlier, to 13.5% at the end of the Second Quarter.
Asset risk has also increased by NOK400 million in the quarter to NOK4.0 billion. The
increase in the capital requirement is, to a large degree, due to an increased capital
requirement for the stake in Storebrand [ph] as a result of higher market value.
This is, to some extent, contracted by a reduction of the capital requirement for the stake
in SR-Bank as a result of a slight reduction in its market value; in addition, a somewhat
lower real estate exposure result in a small reduction in the capital requirement.

Bloomberg Transcript

The size of the investment portfolio has also decreased. But this largely concerns ﬁxed
income securities with low capital requirement. And thus, does not have a major eﬀect on
the total capital requirement. And the total risk-based capital requirement amounts to
NOK11.5 billion at the end of the Second Quarter, an increase from NOK10.8 billion at the
end of the First Quarter.
Turning to page 13. In this quarter, as before, it is still the rating requirement from S&P that
is the most ﬁnding [ph] of the three capital perspectives that we assess, which the
calculated excess capital amounted to NOK5.1 billion at the end of the quarter, which is
unchanged from the end of the First Quarter. Both the available capital and the capital
requirements are virtually unchanged during the quarter.
And as a reminder, the total proﬁt for the period is not included in available capital during
the year. For the ﬁrst half of 2013, this amounts to NOK1.5 billion.
Turning to page 14. The investment portfolio amounted to NOK55.5 billion at the end of
the quarter and is divided into three sub-portfolios. The Match portfolio is the largest part
of all the investment portfolios.
There are only minor changes in the allocation between and within the separate portfolios
in the quarter. In all, the Investment portfolio was reduced by NOK2.4 billion in the
quarter, among other, as a result of the payment of dividend in May.
Turning to page 15. The Investment portfolio yielded an acceptable return of 1.1% in the
quarter, which is slightly higher than the return in the corresponding quarter last year of
0.9%.

Page 6 of 17



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2013-07-16

The Match portfolio yielded a return of 0.9%. The largest part of the Match portfolio
consists of bonds classiﬁed at amortized costs. And represents a stable [ph] return for the
investment portfolio. The portfolio had a recognized return of 1.0% in the quarter.

FINAL

At the end of the Second Quarter, there was excess value in this portfolio of NOK1 billion,
slightly down from NOK1.1 billion at the end of the previous quarter. It is this part of the
Match portfolio that primarily hedges the Norwegian insurance liabilities.
During the quarter, the average reinvestment rate for these bonds has been around 4.1%
compared to approximately 4.4% in the First Quarter.
The return on bonds classiﬁed as current bonds was 0% in the quarter. The bonds are
recognized at fair value. And this represents the volatility in the return from the Match
portfolio. This is the part of the portfolio that hedged the damage on the Swedish
insurance liabilities.
The portfolio largely consists of damaged mortgage credit securities. And the return in
the quarter reﬂects the low interest rate level in addition to a certain increase in the
interest rate level in Denmark during the quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

This item also includes the interest expense or the unwinding for discounted insurance
provisions related to the Danish workers' compensation.
Associated companies recorded a return of 4.2% in the quarter. The total proﬁt of NOK196
million includes estimate -- a change in estimate from the First Quarter of NOK7 million.
The Free portfolio yielded a return of 0.6% in the quarter. The result for the Free portfolio
is aﬀected by the increasing interest rate level and the increase in credit margins
internationally.
This will not have a negative eﬀect on the investment grade and high yield bonds in
particular. This result is also inﬂuenced by ﬂat development in stock markets.
The result is nonetheless slightly better than last when the Equity portfolio in particular
made a negative contribution to the return.
Year to date, Investment portfolio yielded a 1.4% return. However, adjusted for the
impairment of the stake in Storebrand in the First Quarter, the Investment portfolio has
yielded a satisfactory return year to date of 2.5%, equal to the yield last year.

Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Okay. Then we are at page 16. Shortly, priorities and outlook is more or less unchanged
since the First Quarter. So we can go directly to the Q&A session. So please ask your
questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator

FINAL

(Operator Instructions).

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Matti Ahokas, Handelsbanken. Two questions, if I may. Firstly, on the run-oﬀ situation, you
said that there's no speciﬁc trend. But if you look at the picture on page number 10,
there's actually been a quite signiﬁcant declining trend from 2008 onwards. And
especially during the last couple of quarters, the run-oﬀ gains have been surprisingly
small and also smaller than many of your competitors. So I wonder if you could still give
some light on that and is the 1% level what we should be looking for going forward.
The second question is on the dividend policy. You talked about potentially revisiting that.
Could you give us an update on your thoughts about when this would happen and
anything extra you could add on that?
Thanks.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Matti, the second question was related to --?

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

To the dividend policy, potential changes in that.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Catharina will take the run-oﬀ and I can comment on the second question.

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Yes. I think I'll just come back to my comment that I made during the presentation that the
provisions are made based on the best estimate principle, meaning that in the long run,
the level should be zero.
What we see now is, as we do the best estimates every quarter, there is a trend now
towards a lower -- if you look at the trend on page 10, you will see that, as you correctly
commented, that there has been a trend downwards. But I think this to a large degree
reﬂects what we are having communicated since we was listed in 2010, that the
provisioning are based on best estimate principle. And there are no speciﬁc trends or
circumstances that can -- or that explains the small run-oﬀ gains that we've seen in the
Second Quarter.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Page 8 of 17



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2013-07-16

If I just may quickly follow up on that, that the levels are still lower than what many of your
competitors. I know it's very diﬃcult for you to comment on that. But what is -- what do
you think could be a potential reason for that?

FINAL

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

The run-oﬀ level of our competitors, I don't think I will comment on that. I think that's for
each of them to comment on their levels.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Yes. Regarding dividend policy, we commented after First Quarter that we then expected
an update or a Capital Market Day within nine months to 12 months. The communication
today is actually six months to nine months. So within six months to nine months, we
expect to have -- to revisit our ﬁnancial targets, our exit [ph] situation and our dividend
policy.
So within six months to nine months, we will be clearer. And to that, we have 50 to 80 and
we have said before that we expect to be in the high end of that range, as we have done
since 2010.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Great. Hopefully, it's closer to the six months. Thanks a lot.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Per Gronborg, Danske Bank. Also two questions from my side. First of all, can you clarify
on the ﬂooding cost? You were taking NOK30 million in the segments and the rest in the
Group corporate center. That's NOK30 million for both Private Norway, NOK30 million for
Commercial Norway. How is that done?
The second one may be a bit nitty-gritty. But down to the Bank, that seems to gaining
quite a lot of speed. How much of the growth is mortgage lending? What sort of margins
are you able to write mortgages on in Norway at the moment?

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

I can comment on the ﬂooding costs. It's NOK30 million in total for the two segments.
And the rest is charged to the corporate center.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Can you divide up how much the charge with each of the two operating segments?

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

It's more -- yes.

It's approximately a 60%/40% split Commercial/Private.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

60% Commercial and for Private?

FINAL

A - Janne Flessum

{BIO 19368607 <GO>}

Private [ph] and our corporate center. What was your other question? It was on the Bank,
the ﬁrst question?

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

It was Banking part where we are seeing a quite material lending growth. We are seeing
your loan loss ratio is coming materially down. I guess it's because your mortgage book is
growing quite materially at the moment. Is that correctly guessed/understood?

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

It is correctly understood that the mortgage book of the Bank is growing pretty fast. You
have seen interest levels coming up in the larger banks in Norway. We are not followed
yet on that and we have grown the portfolio a little bit based on that window that has
opened us for smaller banks.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

What sort of margin? I would assume that the -- it must be quite natural that the mortgage
book has a signiﬁcantly lower margin than your old book. How far is the margin
compression should we expect? Or in other words, what sort of net interest income
margin are you writing the mortgages with at the moment?

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

We don't comment on the margin as such. And as you know, there is a combination of
margin on the unsecured lending and the secured lending, as you can see from our
accounts. It's a combination; the 2-point [ph] (inaudible) percentage, it's a combination of
these diﬀerences.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Just seeing a bank that is transforming quite rapidly at the moment, I hoped for a little bit
of help to understand how to model that part of the Group going forward.

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

But it's not the unsecured part of the book that is increasing. It's mainly the mortgage
book.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Exactly.

Date: 2013-07-16

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

And what we also comment, Per, is that we don't expect the same pace of growth going
forward for the second half of this year.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

FINAL

Why? Because the banks have stopped hiking margins, or --?

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Sorry?

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Why don't you expect the same growth going forward? I guess your price advantage still
exists going into the second half.

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

I think what we're seeing in the Norwegian market now, it's a window that has opened up
for smaller banks due to the larger banks being very -- communicated very, what do you
say, maybe aggressive on the hike increases, rate increases. So we see in the Norwegian
market now some more customers changing banks than we would normally see. So it's
due to the market situation.

Okay, thank you.

Operator
(inaudible), Berenberg [ph] Markets.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Two questions from me, ﬁrstly on the claims churn that we've been discussing for the last
ﬁve or six quarters really. Looking at the claims frequencies this quarter, are you now
comfortable stating that what we saw in 2012 was exceptional and largely a statistical
anomaly more than the emergence of a new trend?
That's the ﬁrst question.
The second question is on the structural growth that you're referring to. Are you seeing
any options or any portfolios that are available for sale in the Swedish markets, or are you
still mainly focused on the Danish market?

FINAL

I can start up, (inaudible). The frequency situation we had last year was exceptional. Yes, I
think that's the conclusion. And that's based on the combination of a very mild winter. It
was not any weather-related claims at all. And it was also low frequent levels, both for
property and motor.
As you've heard under the presentation today. And as I commented now, the
development was for the two large products, motor and property, was particularly weak at
the beginning of the quarter. And we had a very strong situation at the end of the quarter.
So we still had strong proﬁtability in the main products. But seen over a period of time, I
think, 2012 was exceptionally low related to frequency.
Structural growth. I've seen the debate after our presentation today. We had some people
looking at opportunities. And opportunities is portfolios. Gouda is a good example. If it's
Sweden or Denmark or Baltic, I don't know. But if it arise, opportunities and portfolios that
can ﬁt into our product mix and of our position, we'll be active related to portfolios going
forward as well.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Thank you. That's very clear.

Q - Will Hardcastle

{BIO 16346311 <GO>}

Will Hardcastle, Bank of America. You show on slide 13 that the S&P A rating's the most
binding capital requirement at the moment at NOK5.1 billion. And you also talk about
that's before the buﬀer level. Could you discuss how you think about what sort of buﬀer
you'd like to hold over and above. And perhaps your thinking behind that if you're unable
to give a percentage or a number?

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

We have not communicated a percentage over the most binding [ph] capital requirement.
But what is very set [ph], of course, there needs to be a buﬀer over the most binding
capital requirement.
And I think, yes, this is part of the discussion that we would like to have in the senior
management and the Board over the next six to nine months as part of, of course, of the
cutting the policy.
But I think what -- the most precise I can be on this is that, of course, there will have to be
a buﬀer about the most binding capital requirement.

Q - Will Hardcastle

{BIO 16346311 <GO>}

Okay. But at this stage, we won't be able to get any sort of quantiﬁcation on that?

David Andrich, Morgan Stanley. Two questions; ﬁrst, I was just wondering if you could
give a little bit of color on the competitive environment in Norway. And particularly in the
GI business.
And then second, I was just wondering in terms of the pension reforms that are going on
in Norway maybe if you could give us a brief update if there's been any changes around
that.

I can start oﬀ with the competitive environment. And if there's any new information
regarding the pension regulations, Catharina can think about that when I start up with the
competitive environment.

Bloomberg Transcript

It's more or less same situation as the First Quarter. I commented during last year and also
First Quarter that our main competitor is the large competitors. So our main competitor
last year and so far this year is actually IF [ph]. And that's also the most active competitor,
at least on the Private side.
TRIG [ph] is also very active by their own sales force and their agents on the Private side.
It's more variable on the Commercial side.
The Savings Bank One Group [ph] is not that active this year compared to last year. We've
seen small players also increase their shares, D&D [ph] and Storebrand. And, of course,
Protector is still active in the Norwegian market.
So this information is more or less the same as we gave after First Quarter. But to
conclude, the biggest competitors beside the Savings Bank One Group, TRIG and IF is
the most active.

And when it comes to the pension legislation, I think the only new information always that
we expect it to come into force in 2015, not 2014 as previously expected. That's the main
new information regarding pension legislation.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Gianandrea Roberti, Carnegie. I have three questions. The ﬁrst one, it's regarding the
combined in the Second Quarter, 90.4%, with the large losses more or less in line with
your expectation. If I look at your overall target of 90% to 93% combined in a normal year,
it seems to me the 90.4% for a Second Quarter is a bit on the weak side. But I'd just like to
hear your thoughts.
I understand there's been some randomness in terms of claims in this quarter. But once
again, I cannot help but think 91% for Q2 it seems a bit weak.
The second question that I have, it's on the rollover of the new tariﬀs. If you can just
remind us which sector or businesses you're really looking at and what kind of
improvement you think you can get out of it. Because if I remember correctly, Norwegian
motor in the Private line, you show us some slides in the past where the loss ratio
improved 300 bps. And it would be interesting to hear potential possibilities there.

Bloomberg Transcript

My last question, it's in the Commercial line; it's the growth in the Commercial customers
in the Nordic segment. Because, overall, 9% premium growth in a quarter, it seems very
high; and obviously, I don't know nearly enough of what I should know in terms of your
product. But I have a bit of a hard time in believing that your product is so diﬀerent from
the others. So I'm just wondering how you're winning all these customers.
Thanks.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

I can start oﬀ with the combined ratio, Gianandrea, 90.3%. As you know, the run-oﬀ gain
was only 0.6% in the quarter compared to 2.3% last year. The large losses is more or less
in line, also including the ﬂood, in line with our expectations.
So, yes, compared to the previous quarters, it's somewhat on the weak side. But as I said,
it was rather weak in the beginning of the quarter and it was strong at the end of the
quarter. So it varies from month to month and quarter to quarter.
But if you adjust for run oﬀ -- and so it's still in the corridor and we are in the corridor. But
compared to previous quarters, it's a little bit on the weak side. That's right.
The tariﬀ program, maybe Catharina.

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Yes, I can give some comments for that. As you know, we started the new tariﬀs, or to
implement new tariﬀs in Private in Norway in 2009. And we continued on with the new

FINAL

tariﬀs in the Commercial market. That's from 2010. And they record a large part of the
Norwegian business. But we're still looking at smaller projects in the Commercial part
(technical diﬃculty) in Norway.
What we're also doing in Norway is, of course, to continuously improve the tariﬀs that we
have already implemented. In the First Quarter this year, we implemented the ﬁrst new
tariﬀ in Denmark within western [ph] motor. And there is, of course, potential for a lot of
new tariﬀs in Denmark and also in Sweden. But this will take time. And it also takes time
for implementing new tariﬀs. But they are implemented ﬁrst and foremost for new
customers or new products that are coming into our portfolio. And only gradually for
current products or current customers.
So it will take time and, of course, if you look at motor in Norway, motor is the product
where you'll probably have the fastest implementation on new tariﬀs due to customers
changing cars more often of course than, for example, housing, etc.
But it's correct that we gave a number regarding the improvement in the combined ratio,
the loss ratio, regarding motor product in Norway. But we did not comment. And it's six
ﬁgures regarding all the new tariﬀs. We were able to do that on the motor product due to,
as I said, the new tariﬀs being implemented very fast within this product especially
compared to other products.

Bloomberg Transcript

But we see of, course, that there is potential for improvement due to better risk pricing
[ph] and better risk selection as a result of these tariﬀs.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Okay, thanks. And what about the growth in the Nordic segment?

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

The growth is mainly within the Commercial book of the Nordic business. And there's
nothing especially to comment on this when it comes to what kind of product, or what
kind of clients. We see now that we are succeeding with our distribution in Denmark and
that's, of course, very good to see. And we also know leads to the order [ph] change in
the agreement with Nykredit; expect to see positive development also within the Private
market going forward.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

And, Gianandrea, I also think it's important to bear in mind that this growth in the Nordic
segments, or Nordic segment, it's after a period of -- where it's ﬂat to negative
development due to re-pricing in the Nordic segment. So as you remember last year, it
was ﬂat/negative development. So after a period of re-pricing and so it's the natural
development, actually.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

FINAL

Vinit Malhotra, Goldman's. Just one thing on the asset side, on the Free portfolio, I notice
the division has gone up in the quarter quite substantially from 0.9 [ph] to 1.9 [ph]. But
could you just comment on why this new creed [ph] was put in place in this quarter? Were
you anticipating some interest rate moves which didn't work?
So that's the ﬁrst question.
The second thing is just to clarify this whole debate around the claims frequency. I've
understood. But was there also something on the average claims time. So in other words
a severity as well where there was a trend in this quarter which you'd like to highlight?
Thank you.
And just to explain [ph], my second question is excluding the Norwegian ﬂood event, if
you could possibly.
Thank you.

A - Catharina Hellerud

{BIO 17276650 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. I can comment on the direction in the Free portfolio. Unfortunately, the ﬁgure in the
last -- the last ﬁgure was wrong. So actually, it's more or less unchanged in the Free
portfolio. So sorry about that.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Okay. All right. And on the claims?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Yes. Your second question was related to average claims cost and development. When I
commented the Second Quarter. And the development was particularly weak at the
beginning of the quarter, as I said, that was ﬁrst and foremost related to frequency
development.
The average claims cost is more or less stable. And the development is stable as we have
commented before. And it's around 4%, the increase for motor. And slightly more for
property. So when we see a weaker claim development this quarter, it's ﬁrst and foremost
related to frequency [ph] development.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

The reason I ask is because, yes, it might have been a weaker quarter. But your underlying
combined ratio had worsened a lot in 1Q but then came back, or improved quarter on
quarter in the Second Quarter. Even ignoring the seasonality, the improvement was less. I
was trying to understand whether there's something else, or maybe the end of the
quarter was really exceptional improvement which oﬀset the beginning.

FINAL

No, I do not -- as I said, it is -- the main shift from last year to this year is related to
frequency and, of course, it's also related to ﬂoods and the more normalized winter. And
if you go into the ﬁgures, it's ﬁrst and foremost related to frequency.
It is also slightly more water related claims on the property side, not only related to the
ﬂoods. But the change from period to period is ﬁrst and foremost changes in the
frequency development.
So as I said, it's nothing in the average claim cost changing from what we have seen and
said and communicated before.
