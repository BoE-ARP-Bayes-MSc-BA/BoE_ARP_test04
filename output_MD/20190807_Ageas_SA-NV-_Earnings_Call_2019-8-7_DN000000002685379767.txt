{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you all for dialing into this conference call
and for being with us for the presentation of the results of Ageas for the first six months
of 2019. As usual, I am joined in the room by my colleagues of the Executive Committee.

FINAL

Hans De Cuyper, the CEO of AG Insurance, is also present in the room. And, of course,
we have our Investor Relations team with us.
Ladies and gentlemen, before commenting on the six-month results, I would like to start
with an update on the Fortis settlement. As you know, 28th of July was the deadline to
submit claims. We do not have yet a completely finalized view as it takes time to analyze
each claim, but we can give you the broad picture. We received in total 290,000 claims,
which is more than we initially anticipated, but the average amount per claim was less than
expected. Only 250 shareholders opted out of the settlement, representing around 1% of
the total settlement amount. This reduced, therefore, our tail risk significantly. Around
EUR600 million have already been paid to claimants and the remaining payments should
be made by the end of the first half of 2020.
On another topic, you have probably seen the press release that we issued this morning,
announcing a new share buyback program of EUR200 million. This is our ninth consecutive
share buyback program, and by this time next year, we will have returned in total EUR2
billion to shareholders through share buyback programs.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning now to the results, the second quarter confirmed the strong start of the year,
thanks to a solid operating performance across all regions and exceptional elements in
UK and Asia. Consequently, our six-month net result stood at a high EUR606 million
compared to EUR441 million last year. This performance gives us confidence that we could
exceed this year our guidance of EUR800 million to EUR900 million Group net result, with
the usual caveat that we do not know how the financial markets will evolve in the second
half of the year. And this could, of course, have an impact.
We pursued in Q2 the solid sales momentum recorded in Q1, resulting in a double-digit
growth since the start of the year when we exclude the sold Luxembourg entity. The
increase in inflows were driven by both the Life and Non-Life activities and spread across
almost all the regions.
The guaranteed margin of the Group was impacted this quarter by a strengthening of our
reserves in Portugal due to the current low yield environment. The guaranteed margin
also included a lower investment income in Belgium since the beginning of the year. As
you know, the level of capital gains is quite volatile per quarter, especially in real estate,
but we expect to reach a target level by the end of the year. The unit-linked margin was
below target due to lower sales in Continental Europe.
As for the combined ratio, the impact of the adverse weather in Belgium in the first
quarter was more than offset this quarter by a strong current year operating performance
in both Belgium and Portugal, further supported by the positive impact of the Ogden rate
review in the UK. As a result, our six-month combined ratio stood at a strong 95.7%.
Our total liquid assets amounted to EUR1.7 billion, EUR0.6 billion of which remains ringfenced for the Fortis settlement. Capital management actions added EUR0.3 billion to
Group cash position this quarter, following the debt issued in April and the internal loan to
AG Insurance.

The EUR633 million dividend upstreamed from our operating companies since the start of
the year covered the cash-outs related to the dividend paid to our shareholders and the
holding costs and will even cover part of the share buyback announced this morning.

FINAL

Ladies and gentlemen, I will now hand over to Christophe for more details on the results.

Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Thank you, Bart. And good morning, ladies and gentlemen. As announced by Bart, we
achieved a very strong year-to-date result at EUR606 million, up 26% compared to last
year excluding the impact of the RPN(i) which was quite strong. The currency impact
played no significant role this quarter.
As usual, I will give you some details per segment. On slide 6, in Belgium, after the first
quarter marked by lower investment result and adverse weather events, we enjoyed a
strong second quarter, driven by a solid operating performance with all technical KPIs,
combined ratio in Non-Life, operating margin, guaranteed business and unit linked,
showing significant improvement compared to Q1.

Bloomberg Transcript

In Life, higher investment results in the quarter compensated for a lower underwriting
result. The six-month guaranteed operating margin stood at 82 bps which shows an
improvement compared to Q1, but which is still below our target of 85 bps to 95 bps. This
is a timing issue in the real estate investment result and a significant capital gain is
expected for Q4. The unit-linked operating margin at 34 bps was in line with our target.
In Non-Life, after a first quarter hit by some storms in March, we achieved in Q2 an
excellent result in most business lines, with a very low combined ratio of 91.1%. The new
internal reinsurance agreement, which brought positive contribution of EUR10 million in the
first quarter, had no significant impact in the second quarter. In line with the presentation
of our Q1 results, all the combined ratio mentioned in the press release and in this
presentation exclude the impact of the internal quota share reinsurance agreement. The
year-to-date pro forma combined ratio, meaning before internal reinsurance, improved to
97.6% including 6 percentage points from adverse weather, which is comparable to last
year.
Since the start of the year, Belgium continued its growth path in both Life and Non-Life.
Inflows in guaranteed products were mostly driven by the bank channel, while inflows in
unit-linked benefited from the successful sales campaigns in Q1. Non-Life inflows
increased across all business lines.
In the UK, slide 7, the result included EUR30 million reserve release relating to the Ogden
rate adjustment from minus 0.75% to minus 0.25%, but this was more than offset by large
claims in motor. The new internal reinsurance agreement contributed EUR20 million to the
six months net result. The year-to-date pro forma combined ratio improved to 96.9% with
the benign weather in household mitigating the large claims in motor.

FINAL

The restructuring cost of EUR13 million was also booked in the non-technical account for
this period. Inflows were down in the UK, following the decision to withdraw from
underperforming partnerships and to enforce strict pricing discipline. Nevertheless the
volumes are now starting to stabilize. While the broker channel remains our predominant
distribution channel, direct sales through the aggregator platforms continue to grow.
In Continental Europe, on slide 8, the six-month results amounted to EUR57 million, up by
18% compared to last year if we exclude the contribution from Luxembourg in 2018. As
already mentioned by Bart, the result in Life was negatively impacted by a strengthening
of our reserve in one fund in Portugal due to the current low interest rate environment. In
Non-Life, the result was strongly up, thanks to a strong performance in Portugal in both
the bank insurance and agency channels and to the increased contribution from the nonconsolidated partnership in Turkey.
The growth momentum continued in both Life and Non-Life. In Life, the higher sales in
guaranteed products more than compensated for the lower unit-linked sales, while NonLife inflows were up in all business lines.

Bloomberg Transcript

In Asia, on slide nine, we recorded an exceptionally high result of EUR331 million. The
result benefited as always from solid operating performance, but also in China from a
high level of capital gain, especially compared with last year where we had impairments.
China also benefited from the positive evolution of interest rates and from a favorable
retroactive change in the tax regime relating to commissions. The sales dynamic
continued in Asia, with Life inflows driven by strong persistency and Non-Life inflows
currently up in all key business lines.
In the Reinsurance segment, on slide 10, as expected, we booked an initial loss following
the implementation of the new internal reinsurance agreement. However, this is internal
and has no material impact on the overall group net result.
Let's go to the general account on slide 11. So the general account generated a positive
net result following the high EUR61 million positive contribution from the RPN(i). The
provision for the settlement has been reduced to EUR636 million following payments
already made to shareholders.
Our Group Solvency II ratio on slide 13 regained altitude at 201% after the issuance in April
of EUR500 million Tier II instrument to compensate for the call of the AG Insurance debt
instrument, which took place in March of this year. Nevertheless, the Solvency decreased
by 14 percentage points over the semester, mainly due to the acquisition in India and to
the lasting drop in the yield curve which specifically affected the solvency ratio in
Continental Europe. The operational free capital generation on slide 14 amounted to
EUR257 million for the first half of the year and to EUR163 million excluding the EUR94
million dividend paid by the non-European, non-consolidated participation. This figure of
EUR163 million is below the guidance of EUR130 million a quarter we have indicated
before and needs some further explanations.

FINAL

The breakdown by segment which is given on slide 58 of the pack shows that the main
gap comes from the UK where we suffered, as already mentioned, from large losses in
the motor book which are seen as exceptional. The corresponding additional technical
result hit the free capital generation of the UK twice, first on the Own Fund for EUR59
million and also on the SCR for EUR30 million.
Taking into account the 175% target capital applied on the SCR, these two effects resulted
in a EUR111 million hit to the operating free capital generation of the Group. To a lower
extent, in Continental Europe, Portugal was also slightly weak because of some re-risking
on the investment portfolio, which increased the SCR and also because of the lower
contribution of the value of new business due to the lower interest rates observed now in
that country. Corrective measures have been taken to mitigate this.
The EUR119 million negative contribution of exceptional items come from the
implementation of the internal reinsurance and the end of the stop loss between the UK
and the Group, the impact is at EUR95 million. This is mainly related to model effects and
from the adjustment from the final -- with the final Ogden rates at minus 0.25%, whereas
our former assumption was zero percent for solvency calculation.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the end of my presentation and I leave the room for
questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the introduction of the conference and we now
open the call for question. (Operator Instructions) We have our first question from Ashik
Musaddi from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Hello. Hi. Good morning. This is Ashik here from J.P. Morgan. Just three questions. First of
all, on M&A. Now, clearly, one thing that we have noticed is in past three, four years, you
have missed out on few acquisition expectation, like, for example, Ethias, recently Fidea;
then again you missed out on Tranquilidade and you were not able to get AGI -- AG as
well, the 25%. How should we think about acquisitions going forward? I mean, do you feel
any pressure that you need to do an acquisition or do you remain disciplined on the M&A?
I mean, clearly, you have continued to do the buyback, which is very well reflected in your
share price, and I think the discipline is very well appreciated by the market, but what is
the risk of you relaxing those criteria that you had for M&A going forward as well? So
that's the first question I have.
Second one is on Asia. I mean, if I look at Asian earnings, EUR330 million for first half,
obviously, this has a few capital gains and the China tax-related things. So even if I adjust
for that, it's still EUR210 million versus your guidance of EUR275 million to EUR325 million.
So how should we think about that? Do you think your guidance is low or shall we still stick
with that guidance? So any thoughts on that would be great.
Page 5 of 22

FINAL

And thirdly, on Asian dividends, I mean, Asian earnings are going up rapidly, but in this
year, if I notice, the dividend from Asia has just gone up like tiny amount, actually gone
backwards. So how should we think about the dividend from Asia? So should we be
expecting a pickup in dividend from Asia? Any thoughts on that would be great. Thank
you.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you, Ashik, for the three questions. On the first one, on M&A, let's say with -I would like to make a difference between Ethias and AG Insurance on the one side and
then Fidea and Tranquilidade on the other side. Why? Because, let's say, Ethias has never
been a real concrete file. It has not been for sale and is not a file we expect in the near
future. AG Insurance is -- was a particular situation where, okay, we were prepared for
both situations, having 100% or staying at 75%. And in both situations, I think we would -could have been happy and we are happy with the outcome as it is today.

Bloomberg Transcript

The two others, Fidea, Tranquilidade, as you point correctly, we each time look to not only
strategic rationale, but also the financial conditions. And in line with our previous approach,
we have decided not to go beyond a certain level of price that we're willing to pay in
order to make the deal, let's say, defendable, in line with our overall strategy that we
communicated since 2009 and repeated in the Investor Day last year in September.
Going forward, we keep spotting opportunities, and also in line with strategy, if we don't
see them, we move to the buyback scenario. So don't expect us to completely change
our pricing -- our financial discipline. This is something that we keep high on the agenda.
Second question with respect to Asia, I think your analysis is spot on. So if you look, the
EUR330 million and you fully exclude, for Asia, the cap gains that are mentioned on slide
20 of EUR69 million and you take out what is not an official figure, we can mention about
the tax impact, but I think most analysts were very precise in what the impact was, you
come to something like EUR210 million, which is indeed more than half of our guidance of
EUR275 million to EUR325 million.
Two reasons why we are not bullish to immediately increase this range, is that, on one
side, if there might be an impact in financial markets, equity markets, it's most probably
most hitting the Asian equity book. And secondly, we always see that Q4 in Asia is lower
than the first quarters due to the fact that they recruit more agents, make more costs in
Q4 in order to prepare a good start of the year. But I would say, this year, in any case, we
expect to exceed this guidance. That's also the reason why we are quite confident that
we will go above our EUR800 million to EUR900 million net profit expectations for the
Group. And I would say, let's have a look how this goes on in the coming quarters before
we really, I would say, officially broaden this range.
The third question on the dividend, if you look, and I think you also see it in the free capital
generation overview, we received something like EUR89 million dividends from noncontrolled participations. We have a solid dividend year after year from Thailand and
Malaysia, see no reason why it would change. In China itself, the dividend was last year
30% of the local results. Local result was last year higher than our IFRS result due to

Page 6 of 22



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2019-08-07

impairment rules. So if the evolution of the profit in China and Asia overall continues as it
is now, we could expect, in absolute numbers, a higher dividend from Asia.

FINAL

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Thank you. That's very clear. Just one quick follow-up on that. Is it fair to say that -- do you
think that the Asian earnings are trending towards the high-end of the range of EUR275
million and EUR325 million, which is just EUR125 million for next two quarters? Is it fair to
say that or not really?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Let's say, it's fair to say that, for this year, we expect to exceed that range. Yeah, in any
case.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Yes. Okay. Perfect. Thank you.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

And again, with the caveat there of the financial markets.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, that's very clear. Thank you. Thanks a lot. And thanks a lot for your management
discipline on M&A. Thank you.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. Next question from Albert Ploegh from ING. Sir, please go ahead.

Q - Albert Ploegh

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning, all. I've got three questions as well. The first one, to start on the free
capital generation, slide 58, if I strip out Q1 and look in isolation to Q2 only, and also
eliminating the dividends, I think there was something like a shortfall of roughly EUR100
million to reach your 125%, 135% [ph] quarterly guidance. I know there are many moving
parts in the UK, Continental Europe in reinsurance. So maybe you can help us bridge that
gap a little bit with the SCR impacts and the large motor losses in the UK, specifically. That
will be question one.
The second one on the UK with the large motor claims, it seems in the press release, if I
read it correctly, that it seems to be some kind of a one-off event, but how certain can we
be? So is there any future impact from this as well on the earnings? So any views there
would be appreciated.
Page 7 of 22



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2019-08-07

And the final question is more, let's say, a question on the capital gain outlook. I think you - in the opening statements, you make clear that real estate budget should still be
delivered for the full year. Can you remind us again what that budget is and what we more
or less can expect to flow through in the earnings in Q4? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

I propose to pass the questions respectively to Christophe, Antonio and Hans.
Christophe?

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

You are right. And the shortfall is around EUR100 million. In my speech, I discussed the
year-to-date approach that the shortfall is more concentrated on Q2. And you are right
that we have to explain this. I will refer to the same explanation as the one I gave during
the speech. So coming back on the UK, the large losses started in Q1, but the main effect
was observed in Q2. And as I said, unfortunately, you have kind of double hit when you
increase the reserve. You have, first, lack of result because the increased reserve directly
hit your result, and so your eligible Own Fund, but then with your increased reserve, you
have an additional SCR. And the additional SCR is even, in our calculation, with a 175%
target capital, is amplified. So the impact is the decrease in Own Fund plus 175 time the
increase in SCR. And it's the reason why I made to this rough estimate of EUR111 million
year-to-date. So I don't have the same calculation on the top of my head for Q2, but most
of this is related to Q2. The effect was limited in Q1. So most of it was in Q2.
And for Portugal, it was more a Q2 effect. The Portugal, so the fact that we have the rerisking, so it means that they bought slightly more equities. And the low value of new
business, but something which occurred in Q2.
All in all, these are (inaudible) exceptional. On the one hand, on the UK, exceptional. On
Portugal, as I said for the product, we have taken actions. The commission that have been
reduced by the bank. So I think that we shouldn't to change the guidance at this stage.
And today, I confirm for the future, the EUR130 million run rate for the future quarter.

Q - Albert Ploegh

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Antonio Cano

{BIO 16483724 <GO>}

Hello. Good morning. Antonio here. I'll try to give you some details on what happened in
the UK on the large motor claims and whether this is a trend or not. So what we have
seen already starting, as Christophe was saying, towards the end of Q1, but more
accentuated in Q2, is an increase of -- these are bodily injury claims involving what's called
vulnerable road users where we normally have about 15 cases in each quarter. In Q2, we
had well above twice that number. But as important is also the fact that the severity, so
the average of these large bodily injury claims was also quite higher. So we had quite a
number of claims around our EUR3 million retention level.

Page 8 of 22



FINAL

Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2019-08-07

Now, obviously, we've gone through all the numbers and looked to any possible root
cause, channel, year of underwriting, risk type, all the usual analysis. We didn't find any
trends. We also asked an external third-party, an actuarial firm to take independent look.
Also, their conclusion was that, in fact, there is no clear trend. It is also so that we don't
get any signals from the market that this is a trend that our competitors are spotting.
Nevertheless, I will still keep a bit of a doubt whether there is a trend or not. For now, we
have not really detected a trend. So it might be just volatility, although an extreme form of
volatility.
Okay. I appreciate that.

A - Hans De Cuyper

{BIO 17991990 <GO>}

And Hans De Cuyper on your final question on the capital gains real estate. We always
target a return of roughly 5% on a yearly basis on our real estate portfolio. So in euros,
that would mean that we realize around EUR70 million to EUR80 million gross capital gains
also every year. Due to the seasonality of these transactions because most of the time
they are bigger transactions, we're not yet halfway, which is reflected in that operating
margin, but we remain very confident to minimally achieve that target by the end of the
year.

Q - Albert Ploegh

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

Thank you. Next question from David Barma from Exane. Please go ahead.

Q - David Barma

{BIO 19957338 <GO>}

Yes, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. The first one is a follow-up on the
UK. And besides the large losses, what are you seeing in terms of claim inflations and the
price development and how should we read that in the top line development, which
seems to be stabilizing now?
My second question is on China. And there, could you give us your view on the potential
impact of this commission change on the competitive environment, if not too early to tell.
And lastly, on Belgium, could you -- what's your outlook for the Belgium Life business and
especially on the guaranteed side considering the interest rate outlook and in light of the
drop in the credited rate we've already seen in 2018? Thank you.

A - Antonio Cano

{BIO 16483724 <GO>}

Okay, thank you. So a bit of a follow-up on the UK. So I believe that your question was
more about claims inflation and development of rates. In claims inflation, I keep aside the
bodily injury claims I just discussed. If we look more at the traditional damages and the
material damages claims inflation, there, frankly, it's more like a positive news. We don't
really see a pickup of claims inflation, although a lot of people are expecting that related

Page 9 of 22

FINAL

also to the Brexit. We don't see that in our numbers. So thinking we are more on the
positive side.
In terms of rates, the recent Confused.com and Willis Towers Watson market review
showed that, during Q2, they saw a 3.5% rate increase overall in the market. I think we are
more or less in that range. Going forward, I think people are adapting to the slight
surprise, let's put it that way, of the Ogden rate not being at zero or positive, but still a
negative. So it is somehow logic that you see this slight rate pickup.
In terms of growth of our business, as Christophe was also mentioning in his introductory
speech, we're still suffering the effect of the loss of some accounts that, for various
reasons, we thought were not profitable, but we see indeed volumes stabilizing, a nice
growth in the direct business. And in Q2, actually, the drop on current -- with current FX
rate movements excluded was only slightly negative. So -- and we are also slightly above
what are our internal targets.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. With respect to China and the impact on tax of the increase of the cap on
commission deductibility, so what we have taken in our results half year was the
retroactive benefit for 2018. As mentioned, so Taiping Life has not published its results
yet, it will come soon, and so we prefer not to disclose the precise figure, but we can
always say that what we have seen that is mostly mentioned by your analysis is in
reasonable estimate.
With respect to, i would say, the recurring benefit of that, so the 2019, this has not at all
been taken until now in the half-year results. Also, because we are not -- it's not clear yet
what the market will do. Will it be fully taken as a profit or will part of it be used to give
higher profit sharing to that pricing, to change commission, so it's a bit too early. But -- so
today, the only effect taken into our half-year results was the guaranteed recovery over
2018. And I'm sure that, in Q2, we will be able to tell a bit more about the future
treatment of that advantage.

A - Hans De Cuyper

{BIO 17991990 <GO>}

Okay. Your last question on Belgium, I assume with dividend, I think you mean the profit
sharing towards our customers. Of course, we are only half the year, so we cannot tell you
anything and definitely not disclose anything on the dividends on our guaranteed
portfolio. The only thing I can tell you is that we always closely monitor inflows, outflows,
guaranteed rate and then profit sharing to secure our investment margin in the long run.
And you know our asset liability management profile, which is underneath, which we also
always want to protect. And today, we have no concerns on this approach for the
remainder of this year despite the low-yield environment. We always take the required
measures to maintain that investment margin. But on profit sharing itself to the end
customers, I cannot tell you anything at this stage of the year.

Thank you. Next question from Fulin Liang from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Fulin Liang

{BIO 21126177 <GO>}

Hello. Thank you. I have two questions. The first one is regarding Asia, and especially
China. And so just wanted to hear management views on the future competitive
landscape, given that China is actually -- lift up the ban on the foreign investors in the life
insurance space. So do you think the competitive landscape will change and will be
especially for the domestic players like Taiping Life? That's my first question.
And then, second one is, so you strengthened the reserves as a result of a lower interest
rate. However, the interest rate actually is keep falling. And since you strengthened, will
you actually further -- have to further strengthen the reserve? So what should we think
about that?
Sorry. Actually, I have three questions. The last one is, you mentioned about the Belgium is
helped -- the margin improvement is helped by the investment results. So I just wonder
how much of that investment result is actually recurring and we can expect -- should we
expect this margin improvement to continue in the future? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay, I'll take the first question and handover for the second one to our Chief Risk Officer
and to Hans for the question on Belgium. With respect to Asia, we have, since 2001,
opted to enter into a joint venture with a very strong local partner, who has the
knowledge of the market, the distribution capacity, being Taiping Group, and we see
indeed the market opening to foreign investors. And, okay, increased competition is
always helpful. We don't see the market decreasing in terms of opportunities. So we still
believe that future growth is guaranteed in that margin. We will surely take our place in
that. We have now something like 4.5% market share. We are on the top 6. And we see
indeed that the new comers, but also a lot of local ones, take little by little a bit more
market share, but that's, in many cases, due to single premiums, something we almost
banned in our portfolio. I think 93% of the business we do is regular premium. And we will,
together with the partner, stick to, let's say, a very prudent and, at same time,
commercially strong proposal to our customers. So not really puzzled or, let's say,
frightened by the fact that competition will increase.

A - Emmanuel Van Grimbergen

{BIO 18010465 <GO>}

Okay. Good morning. Emmanuel. Indeed, so you are right. In Portugal, we had to
strengthen the reserve in one particular front due to, indeed, the big decrease in the
interest rate. And if we just look at the swap rate, the swap decreased by 60 basis points
over the first six months. And since then, we have an additional decrease of 27 basis
points. So we took some actions. One of the action was to strength the reserves, what we
did in Q2, but we did also some rebalancing in the asset portfolio, some re-risking, what
you can also see in the operational free capital generation of Continental Europe.

And finally, also, measures has been taken for new business in order to make sure that a
minimum margin is kept. So in a nutshell, measure on new business and also rebalancing
of the asset portfolio has been taken in the second quarter.

FINAL

A - Hans De Cuyper

{BIO 17991990 <GO>}

Your last question on the investment result in Belgium, indeed, we saw in Q2 -- because
you asked about the quarter -- an improvement on the investment results of roughly 23
basis points, but partially offset by a slightly lower underwriting result due to mortality,
which we also see a little bit as a less quarter, but nothing structurally. But when we
combine everything, we always come back, of course, to our asset liability matching
profile and the ambition to achieve the targets of 85 basis points to 90 basis points. And
as of today, we are well on track with the caveat of the seasonality of the capital gains.

Thank you. Next question from Jason Kalamboussis from KBC Securities. Please go ahead.

Q - Jason Kalamboussis

{BIO 4811408 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning, gentlemen. I had three questions. The first one is, I just want to
understand -- coming back to the first question of this session, when you approach the
M&A, clearly, there are a number of targets that didn't materialize. So it's great to have
the discipline. But do you find that when you're approaching -- we're talking about the
amounts that probably are above EUR0.5 billion, you do have also strategic elements in it.
That means that, at the end of day, you look at -- it's one thing to have -- if you have the
same return, say, in Portugal or in Asia, at some point, you cannot do three acquisitions of
-- the sizable acquisitions. So you will be decide and you have a strategic bias that would
send you more towards Asia versus Europe. So I was wondering if you have any such
criteria in your mind.
The second thing is, in the UK, do you have -- I thought, by the way, that it was only higher
severity, not higher frequency. If I understood it well, you had high severity and frequency.
So do you find that there you have some sort of anti-selection or the recent problem in
your distribution. So I can appreciate that you said that you looked into it, but it is quite
striking that, if you are the only one, and especially given some problems that we have
seen in the UK over the last years, what do you see on that front?
The third thing is on Asia. If there are assets that are to become available in the market,
would you be happy to pay over to buy someone else's joint venture and also pay for
continuing partnership agreement? Or do you prefer the model where you still have less
than 50%, find a local partner and build it up from scratch? Thank you.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. On your first point, M&A strategy, whether it would send us more to Asia than
Europe, again, one element that also will come to the table when we look to Asia is, of
course, our promise on dividend. So we try to balance the portfolio between Europe and
Asia. Also, in the context of our dividend promise. And if we go back again to the investor

presentation in September last year, when we talked about opportunities we look at in
Europe, we primarily look to opportunities in the Non-Life here where you have, let's say,
mature activities that are cash generative, that permit us to broaden the pool of upstream
cash in order to pay our dividends. So really major, major M&A files in Asia. It is not exactly
what we believe will be concrete in the coming period.
And maybe then also go to your last question, whether we would be doing others than
minorities. Let's say, we have today one non-minority deal in Asia, which is the Philippines
where we have 50% plus one share. The other time, minorities. And one of the reasons is
that we believe that we are -- I would say this is one of our strengths that we are good,
solid, long-term partners that do not need the majority and where we, by teaming up with
a strong local partner, have a quicker start with the distribution available, with already
customer base available. But never say never. So we spot opportunities in the regions
where we are interested in, but we will always keep that financial discipline that I also gave
us an answer to the first question of Ashik.

(inaudible), Jason. Coming back to the UK and its large losses, so it is indeed, as you say.
We see both an increase in number of the severe cases and also the average cost of
those cases is higher. So it is both.
Obviously, some people including myself have spent some time and some sleepless
nights understanding what is happening here. Bear in mind, we're not talking about
hundreds of cases here. It's having like 10 more cases involving what's called vulnerable
road users, pedestrians, cyclists, there is no clear trend that we see. We continue to
follow it up. Our current view is still, okay, there is no clear trend and there's no clear
reason why the nature of our portfolio should be more vulnerable to these types of
accidents.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi there. Good morning, everybody. Just going back to low yields. I noticed that, in the
second quarter the product potentially less attractive. So I was wondering what you think
of your kind of outlook in a low yield environment for inflow growth in guaranteed life.

Page 13 of 22



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V

FINAL

Secondly, going back to your comments about partnerships in the UK that are
underperforming, can you give us some more details on what kind of partnerships are
underperforming and what your ambitions are for aggregator business going forward as a
proportion of your book?
And lastly, just to go back on question just asked earlier, is there any more kind of
vulnerability or positivity on yields in Portugal? So the reserve increase, was that just a oneoff boost? Or is there some sort of link or the swap rate that we need to be aware of ?
Thank you.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Well, I can give you feedback on inflow in Belgium. Of course, we closely monitor our new
money yield, which is still at an attractive level due to the mix where we invest in fixed
income. You referred to second quarter that we have lower inflow, but main reason there
is the seasonality of the commercial campaigns, driven by the bank. Year-on-year, we had
a very strong first quarter this year. We had a very strong second quarter last year. So if
you take it year-to-date, we still see a fairly outperformance in growth compared to last
year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Indeed, we closely monitor, as I said before, the inflow in the guaranteed business, but
we still have adequate room for the remainder of the year to maintain the growth
momentum that we have seen in the first half. So there is no real need to start pushing
down sales volumes. It's mainly linked to the timing of commercial campaigns in the bank
channel.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

On the UK, so the nature of the partnerships, I think we've mentioned that already in the
past, it involve some MGAs, but also some affinity partnerships with car brands and some
retailers. Those are one that we have stopped.
And in terms of our aggregate -- direct aggregator channel, it is still relatively small. I think
it represents about 10% to 15% of our business today, but it is an area that is growing. And
let's face it, we are personal lines, motor insurer in the UK mainly and the market or the
customers have moved already to these aggregated channels. So we think we should
have also a more stronger presence in the channel. And so far, so good. We're quite
happy with the performance there.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Can I just quickly follow-up on that one point? So is there a correlation between the
vulnerable...?

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

On your question on the reserving in Portugal, indeed, so we have to keep in mind that, in
the first six months, there was quite a heavy drop in the yield. Then, in the swap, there
was a decrease of 60 basis points. Since then, we have an additional 27 basis points.

FINAL

Again, we took actions on re-balancing the portfolio in Q2, looking also for new
investment opportunities. We have also to look at how will the spread evolve. So since the
end of Q2, for instance, the spread on Portugal increased a little bit. So that can
compensate and help also the situation. I don't believe that we will -- moving forward that
we will have the same type of hit as we had in Q2. But, of course, we cannot completely
exclude it, but we are following up and taking measures to reduce it. Thanks.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Thanks. Can I just -- could I possibly return on the UK quickly? So is there a correlation
between the large vulnerable persons claims that you're seeing and the partnerships? So
can we see that this might possibly get better as you switch your mix?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

No. We see no correlation there. There is no really a channel correlation.

Q - Farooq Hanif

Thank you. Next question from Robin van den Broek from Mediobanca. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Robin van den Broek

{BIO 17002948 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning, everybody. First question is on your payout. Last year, at your Investor
Day, you changed from net insurance result to reported results. Obviously, 2019 is building
up quite a bit of one-offs in a positive way. So your ordinary dividend is very likely to grow
substantially year-on-year. I was just wondering, how does that change your dynamics? I
think in the past, you said that one-third of the buyback basically needs to be financed
from the liquid buffers. With these dynamics in place, on a normalized basis, that's
probably changing. Today, you reiterated EUR200 million buyback. So short term, that's
not an issue for you clearly, but how should we think of that? And just to confirm that
everything will be still an ordinary dividend? You're not going to put partly -- part of that in
a special?
Second question is on Asia. You mentioned that there is a one-off benefit from the rate
developments in the results. Could you quantify that? And also, I'm wondering to see your
thoughts going forward because it seems that your 750-day average will inflect to
becoming a headwind at the end of this year. So maybe you could give some
quantifications on that and also remind us how the mismatch in duration sits in Asia and
what kind of risks you could see there? And lastly, just maybe a quarter-to-date update on
your Solvency II ratio. Thank you.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay, Robin. First of all, the question on dividend. I think we have two clear messages that
we gave at the Investor Day. The first one was that we're moving now to the group result.
Page 15 of 22



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2019-08-07

FINAL

Starting off with a policy of a payout of minimum 50% of the group result excluding, of
course, the non-cash RPN(i) effect. And in line with our tradition and our track record, we
have an interest and intention to keep that promise. So we will pay out minimum 50% of
the group net result. But as I mentioned earlier, we are confident that this will be outside
or above the EUR800 million to EUR900 million range that we normally expect.
Second point is with respect to the buyback, we also gave a promise of a buyback of
minimum EUR150 million unless there would be sizable M&A. Also there, that's a promise
that we will keep. We also mentioned in that Investor Day, and I assume that's what you
refer to, that looking also to the past, looking to what we normally expect in a year that a
part of this buyback should be funded or could be funded by the excess upstream
dividends. Like this year, you could see that's something like 125% or 120% of the
upstreamed dividends is available for this new buyback. It could be that it's less next year
then due to a very high dividend, but that's to be assessed at that moment. But the two
promises, minimum 50% payout and a minimum of EUR150 million buyback unless sizable
M&A activities, are two promises that we will keep and realize.
Then the second question, maybe it was impact from rate developments. I assume you
refer to impact on the reserving?

Q - Robin van den Broek

{BIO 17002948 <GO>}

Yes, the 750-day average?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Let's say, to give figures half year -- where it was last year in the first half, a positive
impact of EUR5 million. This year is a positive impact of EUR18 million. So it's a difference
of a bit more than EUR10 million. Most of it in the second quarter.

Q - Robin van den Broek

{BIO 17002948 <GO>}

And if that changes going forward, I think Q1 next year, I think the average could be down
5 bps, while I think last year it was up 1 bps or 2 bps. I think, in the past, you alluded to
EUR50 million in one quarter. Can you remind us what the swing was of the 750-day
average year-on-year in that quarter?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

I personally don't have that figure in mind and propose to maybe take it up with Investor
Relations team. Okay?

Q - Robin van den Broek

(inaudible) is a well-known issue, the fact that there is a big duration mismatch. You have
very long duration products. So very long liabilities. And available assets are as such that
you cannot match this on liability [ph]. So there is a mismatch.
Two answers on this. So first, the allocation to the equity portfolio is quite large and, to
some extent, you can consider that, on the long term, and we are taking very long-term
product, equity -- with a lack of available assets to match this duration, equity are well
suited to this kind of thing, but you have an inherent risk. But for sure -- but it is an answer.
And the second answer is that you have some big margin on this product. And at the end,
this big margin gives you room to manage the interest rate risk.
So in conclusion, true, there is an issue. It is structural due to the product themselves. And
two, in front of this structural issue, you have the large equity allocation, which is an
answer on the long-term. And then, the fact that margin are high enough to manage the
corresponding interest rate risk. Thank you.

A - Antonio Cano

{BIO 16483724 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And on your last question, to comment on the evolution of the solvency over the quarter,
what I would like to do is to refer to page 55 where you have, on the right-hand side of
the slide, some details explaining the increase of the solvency from 194% Q1 to 201% by
the end of Q2. So we had indeed the issuance of the debt that is boosting the solvency
by 13%.
And then, on the market, we have 0% impact on the market. There, you could say that's a
good performance. And the way that you have to read it is we are negatively impacted by
the decrease in the swap curve over the second quarter, which is in line with our
sensitivities. And this negative impact is compensated by spreads, but also by FX. And the
FX is due to the fact that -- you know that, at the group level, we need to have a capital
for our UK -- a fixed currency capital for our UK business. And since, in Q2, the solvency of
the UK decreased slightly, our capital that we have to hold is also lower. So for the market,
it's a neutral evolution. Negative interest rate impact, in line with sensitivity, compensated
by spreads and currency.
And then, finally, operational over the quarter is a plus 3% on the solvency there. It's
probably on the low end side of the range. But there, we already give quite some insight,
mainly driven by, on the one hand, the UK and the large losses in the UK. And on the other
hand, also some re-risking in Portugal. And then, we have the usual share buyback and
expect dividend. Share buyback, minus 1%; and expected dividend, minus 4%. Thank you.

FINAL

Q - Bart Jooris

{BIO 3470300 <GO>}

Yes, hello. Thank you for taking my questions. A lot have been answered. I have quite
some disturbance on the line when you were answering the Asia guidance. Could you
repeat that? Did I understand it well that you do not change the guidance, but you expect
it to be on the higher end?
Then continuing on Asia, could you give us more details of the underlying good
performance? Are we talking about better underwriting effects, better investment result
even if we exclude the capital gains? And then, on the UK, the Ogden rate became lower
than what you expected. This came, of course -- the decision came very recently that take
into account the further decline of interest rates. And then, when do you expect the next
review of the Ogden rate?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Bart, on the first question, the guidance, so what I said is that we keep our range at
EUR275 million, EUR325 million for the time being, being more the -- let's say, what you
could call the multi-year provision for the next period. But we expect this year, unless
unforeseen, let's say, financial markets impact, that we will end up the year in Asia, of
course, out of this range and above the EUR325 million. As we're already at EUR330
million now, this should be the normal expectation.
Underlying, in the first -- the second question of Ashik, he made -- he deducted
somewhere the full capital gains for Asia of the first half and also what he expects the
impact of last year of tax and came to something like EUR210 million. If you would do a
similar exercise for past year, also taking out or correcting for the, at that time, minor
capital losses or impairments, you had last year something like EUR185 million. So this year
compared to last year is something like 12%, 13% increase of the result, if you exclude
impact of impairments in capital gains.
And as we are increasing the underlying technical liabilities, and you can see that
somewhere on slide 5 or 6, I think -- it's on slide 5 -- with more than 10% year-after-year.
So it's not abnormal that you can expect the underlying profit to follow that route. Also
know that we have still some start-ups like Malaysia and Vietnam where, in the first years,
we also expect better results than what we have now.

A - Antonio Cano

{BIO 16483724 <GO>}

Okay. On the Ogden rate, indeed, it is what it is, it's minus 25 basis points. Bear in mind,
today, now IFRS is also based on the minus 25 basis points. And that's also the case for
our best estimate. So we don't have this divergence anymore. And our best estimate
year-end last year was still based on a zero percent. So that has led to an increase of
provisions.
When will it change? I think it is within five years. So somewhere between today and five
years, we could expect the change. Don't ask me what the trigger would be to have a
Page 18 of 22

revision before five years as you don't have to ask me a lot of things on UK politics.

Q - Bart Jooris

{BIO 3470300 <GO>}

FINAL

All right. Okay. Just one small follow-up if I may, you stated that you take -- for the tax
impact in China, you stated you took into effect the recuperable tax over 2018. But what
about the first half 2019?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

So in the half year results that we present today, there is no impact of the tax review in
China for this year. So the only amount that is in the results is the recovery for 2018. And
2019, as I mentioned in one of the other answers, we are still looking on how the market
will deal with that. Will it be purely taken into profit or will part of it be used for improving
customer products or using it in the commercial development? It's a bit too early, but
there you can expect us in Q3 to have a clear view on that. So the positive is that we did
not take anything in account of the potential benefit for this year.

Q - Bart Jooris

{BIO 3470300 <GO>}

Okay. But of course, 1H '19 has already finished. So you should have an idea there? So do
you just wait till the third quarter to draw your final conclusions? And can we then see a
potential impact if there is one reported every quarter?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Sorry, the decision has been made in the course of Q2. So it's not that we have been
ready. And I say we, it's Taiping Life together with us, to already take the final decisions.
The only thing I can say that, indeed, in Q3, we should have a clear view on that.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Yes. Hi. Just one follow-up question on your Belgium and Central Eastern Europe and
combined ratio. In Belgium, second quarter was 91% and Central Eastern Europe, and
which mainly is Portugal, let's say, is 89%. This compares with your guidance of, I think,
sub-96%, something like that. How much of this, you would say, is because of luck which is
amazing weather and how much do you think is like continuing improvement that we are
seeing in underwriting on a regular basis? So just trying to get a bit of sense. The reason
I'm asking this is, similar trends we have seen from likes of AXA as well. And AXA was

Page 19 of 22



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V

saying that, it's not a lot of luck, it's just like consistent pruning of the underwriting. Any
thoughts on that would be great. Thank you.

FINAL

A - Hans De Cuyper

{BIO 17991990 <GO>}

Ashik, I can answer you for Belgium indeed. We do not manage these portfolios based on
luck. We do plan underwriting and pricing quite well. So I believe that I think we are now
structurally in a very healthy position in our portfolios. But, of course, always be aware that,
on a yearly basis, you have the cap not [ph] effect, which we have already I think
consumed for this year in the first quarter. So it's normal that you have a good recovery.
Secondly, second quarter is mostly one of the best quarters we have. And thirdly, AG has
a very strong reinsurance program in place, both on individual events as well as cover on a
yearly basis. So I'm fairly confident on a strong performance. And please don't think it will
always be 91 [ph]. But on an annual basis, we believe we can always stay within the target
of the Group, the 96 [ph] including cut not [ph] effects.

Q - Jason Kalamboussis

{BIO 4811408 <GO>}

Yes, hi. A quick follow-up. Just in Asia, what's would need to happen -- if we put aside the
capital gains, what would get you next year to the lower end of your guidance? What are
the things -- what do you think would be any concern that you could have that could make
you hit the lower end?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

In all fairness, I believe it's mostly effect of financial markets. So impairments like in most
Asian countries. The proportion of equity in the portfolios is higher than in Europe
because the capital requirements are not as severe as they are on the Solvency II. So
that's what we see as the major impact that could bring us to the lower end of the range.

Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your questions. To end this call, let me
summarize the main conclusions. First of all, we achieved record results thanks to a solid
operating performance across all regions and supported by exceptional elements in UK
and Asia. I repeat that we are confident that we could exceed this year our guidance of
EUR800 million to EUR900 million group net result, with the usual caveat that we do not
know, of course, how the financial markets will evolve in the second half of the year.
Second conclusion is we enjoyed a solid sales momentum with a double-digit growth,
driven by both Life and Non-Life. And thirdly, given our solid net cash position and strong
solvency, we decided to launch a new share buyback program of EUR200 million above
the promised minimum EUR150 million.
With this, I would like to bring this call to an end. Do not hesitate to contact our Investor
Relations team should you have outstanding questions. Thanks for your time. I wish you all
