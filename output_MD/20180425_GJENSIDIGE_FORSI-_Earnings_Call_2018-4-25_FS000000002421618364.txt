MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Gjensidige Q1 2018 Results
Presentation. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the
conference over to Janne Flessum, Head of IR. Please go ahead.

Janne Merethe Flessum

{BIO 19368607 <GO>}

Good morning and welcome to this ﬁrst quarter presentation of Gjensidige. As always, we
will have our CEO, Helge Leiro Baastad, running us through the highlights from the
quarter before our CFO, Jostein Amdal, gives you the numbers in more detail. And, of
course, we will have plenty of time for Q&A at the end.
So Helge, please.

Thank you, Janne. Good morning and welcome, everyone. 2018 has started oﬀ with a
harsh winter with heavy snowfall and low temperatures. Several places in central areas of
Norway reported up to three times high snow depth compared to normal levels, resulting
in diﬃcult driving conditions and heavy snow creating huge damages on buildings. This,
together with volatile capital markets characterized the ﬁrst quarter results.

FINAL

As previously communicated weather conditions in the ﬁrst quarters over the past few
years have been relatively benign contributing to better results than we would normally
expect for winter quarter in our region. Last time we had a really harsh winter was in 2010.
So it's important to remember the seasonality we have in the Nordic region and there are
strong variations in the Nordics, and Nordic weather conditions which this winter is clear
reminder of.
Our results are summarized on page 2. Proﬁt before tax amounted to NOK 727 million in
the quarter. The underwriting result was for NOK 411 million, and the combined ratio was
93%. We had a premium growth of 5.7% and we managed to continue operating in a very
cost eﬃcient and lean way. Considering historical average claims levels, we estimate the
weather-related deviation in the frequency claims level during the ﬁrst quarter this year to
be in the range of NOK 250 million to NOK 300 million, and even more if we compare
with the ﬁrst quarter last year which was benign weather-wise.

Bloomberg Transcript

Large losses were also high compared with the ﬁrst quarter last year partly due to the
heavy snowfall. Demanding weather conditions primarily impacted the Norwegian
business. We are happy to see our operations outside Norway deliver signiﬁcantly
improved results compared with the ﬁrst quarter last year, despite weather also being
more adverse in this region. The operations outside Norway contributed to a total of NOK
104 million to the group's underwriting results.
Looking aside of weather eﬀects, the underlying inﬂation trend we had seen in motor
insurance over some quarters now, continues into 2018. We had price measures in place
and more are to come to higher and more frequent increases as our tariﬀ system is set to
be even more agile going forward.
The ﬁnancial results came in at NOK 255 million, or NOK 203 million adjusted for
nonrecurring items. We are satisﬁed with this result on our investments, considering the
market volatility during the quarter. Annualized return on equity year-to-date was 9.3%.
The maps shown on page 3 illustrates both the diﬀerence in weather between winters
2018 and 2017 and also that they are quite extreme in opposite directions, with regards to
long-term and medium snow depth. We encourage you to study the weather statistics
every quarter as it is the highly relevant leading indicator for Nordic concerns.
Just to give a few examples of winter weather eﬀects this quarter, we saw four times more
damages year-to-date compared to the same period last year related to roofs collapsing
due to heavy snow. At Oslo emergency ward, they have treated 30% more fractures so far
this year compared to the same period last year. And we had an increase of more than
15% in the number of motor claims in Norway during the ﬁrst quarter this year compared
to the same period last year. Based on the large amounts of snow this winter, the
Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate sees a higher than normal risk of
severe spring ﬂoods in Southern Norway. If such large ﬂoods occur, it should impact our
second quarter 2018 results.

FINAL

As the largest general insurance company in Norway, we see claims prevention as an
important part of our mission. So as a precautionary measure, we are in the process of
delivering pumping and drying equipment to the high risk areas for ﬂoods. This is the ﬁrst
time an insurance company in Norway takes this kind of large scale preventive measures.
Then moving on to page 4 and leaving the weather for now, I want to give you some
examples of our agility in the customer interface, contributing to keeping up our strong
competitive position. Time to market is of essence when developing the best digital
customer experiences, which is one out of the three operational strategic priorities. The
other two strategic priorities are related to analytics and people. All three are equally
important to secure the position as the most customer-oriented insurance company in our
region, and at the same time delivering on our ﬁnancial target. We are continuously
monitoring market trends and put strong eﬀorts into introducing user friendly and costeﬃcient customer interface solutions with high speed to market.

Bloomberg Transcript

In order to succeed in this area, we are reliant on attracting employees with relevant
competencies. We are competing with all industries that attract the best people, and I'm
glad to see that Gjensidige is able to recruit highly skilled digital talents. Our
attractiveness was conﬁrmed when we received the national award as the industry's most
attractive employer last year.
A selection of many concepts and oﬀerings we have launched in Norway very recently,
are illustrated on the slide. Firstly, we have introduced intelligent inbound call routing
making us able based on a sophisticated prediction model, to automatically route each
customer to the service team with a relevant experience on the expected reason for the
call. This gives a better customer experience and is more eﬃcient for both the customer
and us and contributes positively to the customer satisfaction.
Secondly, we have established a direct messaging system which is linked to each claims
report. Customers having reported a claim can correspond directly with the claims
handler, enabling eﬃcient claims handling processes by making it easier for the
customers to follow-up the progress and for the claims handler to provide updates or
request input.
Thirdly, earlier this month, we launched an online mental health counseling service for our
private customers over 18 years with child insurance or disability insurance. Customers are
oﬀered the web-based program for mental self-help which may either be an alternative to
traditional therapy or an oﬀer which may assist while waiting for a regular psychologist
consultation, for which the waiting time may be several months. The program is
developed by psychologists and services launched together with a start-up company.
Then moving on to our mobile solutions, a few weeks ago, we launched a brand-new
digital concept for young customers to ensure that small ticket belonging by a travel
insurance or have their claims handled. It takes us only ﬁve weeks from idea to launch of
the concept via the (00:09:21) app and we are probably the ﬁrst company to let the
customers buy insurance through augmented reality. It has been very well received in the
market.

FINAL

We also launched a health and lifestyle app in November last year targeting customers
between age 20 and 45. The customer receives health and lifestyle related advice,
articles, activity tracking, and more. All to contribute to having a healthy lifestyle.
Then the ﬁnal example is by far the largest initiative in the ﬁrst quarter, a real estate,
brokerage and property condition insurance. We want to create a better balance between
sellers and buyers of homes, reduce the number of conﬂicts and make real estate
transactions more predictable. We have introduced a new insurance product which
guarantees the condition of the property. With this guarantee, real estate buyers get more
better protection against seasoned eﬀects (00:10:28) than they have today. We are the
ﬁrst insurer to oﬀer this in the Norwegian market and believe this will become the gold
standard going forward.
I will now let Jostein present the results in more detail.

Thank you, Helge, and good morning, everybody. I will start on page 6 where you can see
that the report, a proﬁt before tax of NOK 727 million in the quarter. This is down
compared to the proﬁt reported for the ﬁrst quarter last year driven by lower underwriting
and ﬁnancial results. Both the private and commercial segments in Norway were
impacted by the regulated increase in claims. We estimate the weather-related deviation
in claims compared to historical ﬁrst quarter averages to approximate NOK 250 million to
NOK 300 million. The diﬀerence is even larger compared to Q1 2017 which was
particularly benign weather wise.
As announced earlier starting from this quarter, we will provide more insights in the
Nordic results by reporting Sweden and Denmark separately. The underwriting results of
Denmark of NOK 85 million rose considerably compared to the ﬁrst quarter last year.
Both the Sweden and Baltic segments contributed positively to the underwriting results,
reﬂecting the ongoing restructuring programs.
The Pension business recorded stable proﬁts of NOK 32 million. Retail Banking recorded
a higher proﬁts NOK 122 million mainly driven by portfolio growth. As mentioned, the
ﬁnancial results from our investment portfolio declined to NOK 255 million reﬂecting high
volatility in the ﬁnancial markets during the quarter.
Turning to page 7, premiums rose 5.7% compared with the ﬁrst quarter of 2017, 4.2%
adjusted for currency eﬀects. All main product lines in the Private segment recorded
higher premiums during the quarter. Premiums from the Commercial segment were up
compared with last year following solid renewals for most product lines, particularly for
motor, property, and liability. Sales initiative towards new sectors also generated positive
contributions to premiums for the Commercial segment.
Premium growth in Denmark was driven by the Mølholm acquisition. Adjusting for this
and currency eﬀects, premiums were down compared with the last year due to the re-

underwriting and general price adjustments in the commercial insurance lines. Current
premiums for the private insurance lines in Denmark were up during the quarter.

FINAL

Earned premiums in Sweden increased compared with Q1 2017 driven by the signiﬁcant
premium increases introduced in 2017. The Baltics have recorded lower premiums
adjusting for currency. The decline was driven by portfolio restructuring and repricing
activities aimed at improving proﬁtability.
The development in the loss ratio is shown on page 8. Both large losses and frequency
claims were up compared to the ﬁrst quarter of last year. The harsh weather conditions in
Norway negatively aﬀected by frequency claims and impacted the loss ratio (00:13:38)
percentage points more than expected based on historical averages.
Large losses were up 2 percentage points, partly due to the weather conditions in
Norway. The run-oﬀ gains came in somewhat higher than the expected level of NOK 250
million per quarter and reducing the loss ratio by 1.5 percentage points compared with
last year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Frequency claims rose 5.9 percentage points, with motor and property in Norway
signiﬁcantly impacted by the weather conditions. The underlying motor concession
(00:14:08) trend seen on some quarters now continued into 2018. In Norway, we now
expect an inﬂation at around 6% over the next 12 to 24 months, slightly higher than
before. This is due to the changes in our motor (00:14:22) claims bonus system which are
expected to result in an increase in a number of smaller reported claims.
In order to mitigate the expected claims inﬂation in motor insurance, we have
implemented pricing measures and we'll continue with this going forward. Our planned
average price increases in private motor in Norway, going forward, are now at least in line
with the expected claims inﬂation. We will, however, need to balance price and volume
conﬁgurations continuously. Bear also in mind that it takes 24 months from the initiation of
price increases as these are reﬂected in the account. We are pleased to see positive
development in the loss ratio in Denmark, Sweden and the Baltics and we are conﬁdent
the positive development in these segments will continue.
Let's turn to page 9 for an overview of large losses. Total large losses amounted to NOK
225 million, somewhat lower than the expected level and corresponding to 3.8
percentage points on a combined ratio. The impact is 2 percentage points higher than
the ﬁrst quarter last year ago. And the commercial segments recorded a signiﬁcant
portion of large losses, NOK 118 million for the quarter, partially related to the heavy
snowfall this winter.
Moving on to page 10 to comment the run-oﬀ gains. The runoﬀ gains for the quarter came
to NOK 340 million, higher than the current expected level of NOK 250 million. Random
variations as well as adjustment of large loss provision explained the additional NOK 90
million of runoﬀ gains. Our expectation remains that there will be approximately NOK 250
million per quarter in runoﬀ gains for the rest of 2018. The run-oﬀ had a positive impact
5.8 percentage points on the combined ratio.

FINAL

Let's turn to page 11. The cost ratio for the quarter was 15.3% reﬂecting continued good
cost control. Cost ratio excluding the Baltics was 14.5%. The cost ratio in the Baltic
segment is continuously improving due to ongoing restructuring eﬀorts.
Page 12 illustrates highlights from Bank and Pension operations. Gross lending in the bank
for the quarter was NOK 47 billion and measured by lending volumes, 75% of the Bank's
customers are general insurance customers in Gjensidige. The majority of these lending
volumes are related to mortgage and just a small portion to consumer ﬁnance loans. The
bank reported a pre-tax proﬁt of NOK 122 million in the ﬁrst quarter and the improvement
from the same period last year was driven by portfolio growth. Annualized return on
equity amounted to 10%.
The Pension company recorded a proﬁt before tax expense of NOK 32 million. Assets
under management in the Pension operations amounted to NOK 29 billion. 70% of the
customers in our Pension business are general insurance customers as well. Annualized
return on equity amounted to 12.9%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Moving on to the investment portfolio on page 13, the investment portfolio of NOK 56
billion yielded a return of 0.5% in the quarter, which we deem satisfactory considering
high market volatility during the quarter. The result was positively impacted by NOK 52
million related to the sale of a Danish IT company, SDC (00:17:49). Asset allocation in the
free portfolio reﬂected preparations for dividend and tax payments with adequate fund
invested in money market instruments.
The match portfolio yielded a return of 0.7% on a portfolio of NOK 34 billion. A large part
of the match portfolio consists of bonds at amortized costs which yielded a return of 1%.
The running yield in this portfolio was 3.9% at the end of the quarter and the average
reinvestment rate was close to 3%.
Unrealized excess value amounted to approximately NOK 1 billion. The free portfolio
which amounts to NOK 22 billion yielded a return of 0.1% in the quarter. The return was
generated by our investments in private equity funds and property oﬀsetting the impact
from weak equity and bond markets.
Last but not least, looking at our capital position of page 14. The capital position is still
strong. In February, Gjensidige was granted an approval from the FSA (00:18:48) internal
model to calculate the regulatory capital requirement. The approved model is more
conservative than the model Gjensidige applied for. The FSA has speciﬁed some areas
which have to be deferred, revalidated and documented to get an approval for
Gjensidige original version of the model.
Gjensidige decided to accept the approval and we will continue our dialogue with the
FSA. Same is to have the original version of the internal model approval. However, this will
take time. The legal perspective (00:19:17) internal model. This gives a solvency margin of
159% while owned calibration of internal model gives us solvency margin of 171%. These
solvency margins are calculated using book to reserves. (00:19:30) legal solvency margin

Page 6 of 19



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2018-04-25

should have been calculated using the best estimates. This would have resulted in
solvency margins of 188% and 203% respectively.

FINAL

Changes in the capital position from these two perspectives from last quarter are
relatively small. Eligible capital increases mainly driven by retained earnings and lower
technical provisions due to higher interest rates.
The capital requirement is stable from last quarter. We will continue to balance our capital
structure in a disciplined way in order to support the target return on equity while at the
same time allowing us some leeway for further bottlenecked decisions and stable
dividends.
In the interim report, we have again discussed some of the uncertainties related to the
capital position. Given the new tax proposal that has been launched, we assessed the
likelihood of a taxation on the security provision as higher. This will reduce Solvency
capital by approximately NOK 700 million, however, we expect the cash eﬀects to stretch
over the next 10 years.
I will then hand word back to Helge.

Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Thank you, Jostein. To sum up, we delivered results highly aﬀected by the harsh winter
weather and volatile ﬁnancial markets in the ﬁrst quarter. Looking past the winter, we
experienced the overall good competitiveness and good progress in our operation
overall and balancing cost eﬃciency measures with strategic investments is high on the
agenda also during 2018. Over time, we still expect growth in line with nominal GDP
growth and the combined ratio targets corridor is unchanged. Thank you.
We will now open for the Q&A session.

Good morning. Thank you very much. Helge, just looking at (00:21:50) now its two
quarters in a row we are hearing about the Norwegian winter and snowfall related aﬀects

coming outside the large loss. Have you explored or debated the possibility or some kind
of a reinsurance solution for these kinds of frequency, some kind of an aggregate cover or
something on to that aﬀect, which could provide some relief from this volatility? So, that's
the ﬁrst question.
Second question is, on the solvency, I mean, I'm a bit surprised because I originally
thought you are going to have a discussion with FSA to more align yourself or align – or to
reduce the gap, let's say, between your understanding and their understanding. And I
think now, you have stated that you were not bleeding (00:22:48) at all. How should we
think about the target then because if the FSA is applying stricter rules, are you likely to
change your target range if anything, because that will be important for us to understand
the future plans (00:23:07)? Thank you.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Thank you for your question. I would pass actually both of them to Jostein. Just to remind
you on the reinsurance policy we had, we have had that many years and it's based on
more capital tool, protecting of the capital (00:23:27). Jostein, it seems has had
discussion. I will actually pass both the questions to you, Jostein.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Yeah. I don't think I'll comment on discussions we've had internally. Just to remind you
that the reinsurance program is protecting ourself against events or things and losses.
Natural perilous events of about NOK 200 million as one event will be protected. You
have not – this is not natural perils as such. This is a weather that has aﬀected many larger
business and especially motor and property. And let's remember motor is not really a
natural perilous business as such. It's just been more – a higher frequency of collisions or
losses on the motor portfolio.
On the solvency position, we usually have an annual cycle where we discuss targets or
buﬀer targets above this legal capital requirement each fall. We have – based on this
theme, 120% to 175% buﬀer and for now that is standing.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

All right. Thank you very much.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonny Urwin from UBS. Please go ahead.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Hi there. Good morning. Just one question from me. So we've seen quite a lot of
deterioration come through in the underlying loss ratio in recent quarters. And I
understand the driver of that. Your claims inﬂation has run ahead of pricing. But you're
saying today that planned price increases are in line with claims inﬂation, but I wondered,
are already pricing for claims inﬂation now? And so we should expect more deterioration,

Page 8 of 19



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2018-04-25

but at least you stemmed the tide on the front book, or are you still in catch-up mode and
you plan to catch up in the next – in the coming months? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

I think I'll answer that. Price increases that are being aﬀected and everything renewed now
will be in line with claims inﬂation on average, and our plan price increases going forward
be at least in line in claims inﬂation.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Okay. And can you give us an indication of what those are? I know on motor, you were
ﬂagging – it was around 5% claims inﬂation, wasn't it?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Yeah. And (00:25:57) the same stat around 6% where the last kind of increase is due to
the changes in the (00:26:04) system which makes it a bit, you can say, less publishing
(00:26:09) if you have a smaller claim and expect that to have an impact on claims
frequency in line with what we see a couple of our competitors have done and the price
to catch – to mitigate that. So it's in a way for us, forecasted increase in the claims
problem, it's not a problem as long as we are able to price it through and this is what
we're doing now.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

And I guess you're also saying in your commentary that the tariﬀ model will be more
dynamic going forward. So I guess the aim of that is to prevent this sort of situation arising
again.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

That's two parts. That one is our ability to actually forecast against inﬂation and the second
is when they see a change to implement the changes in the tariﬀ. And it's the last part
that's kind of always improved through the more agile tariﬀ system but to be able for cost
due to claims inﬂation, it's still based on competencies of the people that are closest to
the business.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Great. Thanks, guys.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Niccolò Dalla Palma from Exane. Please go
ahead.

Q - Niccolò C. Dalla Palma
Yes. Good morning. My ﬁrst question is on the solvency targeting. So ﬁrst, if you could
conﬁrm that the A rating target is now being dropped for good so that we – because I
Page 9 of 19

Date: 2018-04-25

FINAL

think we're not getting that information anymore. And secondly, related to that, if you
were to go as low as 125% solvency on a legal perspective, would you be able to keep
your single A rating? I would like to understand that.
And then a question on the taxes. So, there's a NOK 700 million impact to come through
solvency. You mentioned there's a provision already taken. So is my understanding
correct that when we look at reported proﬁt, there will be no impact at all or will we see
something in reported proﬁt over time from the changes that we are seeing? Thank you.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Okay. First, we'll not talk to A rating target. It is still important, as we have explained
earlier and that we have an A rating for some segments, especially on the Corporate
business, for the Bank, for the (00:28:31), and also on the reinsurance side. So, there are
several commercial reasons for keeping an A rating, and we still have that as our ﬁnancial
target.

Bloomberg Transcript

Whether we'll be able to keep an A rating at 125%, one of the reasons why we dropped
reporting the number from the S&P model is that it's just one part of the basis that S&P
uses for giving us a rating. And we don't have a speciﬁc view on kind of the bottom level
of solvency margin that should support an A rating. That's more up to us and our
communication with S&P.
When we have a range of 125% to 175%, the middle point there is 150%, which is kind of a
reasonable starting point where we think we should capitalize over time. But as the
previous – or one of the previous questions asked, it depends a bit on the conservative
reports to build into the model ourselves. So, we'll take all these things into consideration
when we set the target.

Q - Niccolò C. Dalla Palma
That's clear.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

The tax (00:29:28) security question, you're perfectly right, there is no eﬀect on the P&L.
It's a paid tax that increases but also that this has a solvency capital eﬀect. This deferred
tax that we have on our books before this change if it is occurring, plus, deemed as kind
of a perpetual tax, deferred tax liability and now it's done more immediately paid and
then it will need to be subtracted from the solvency calculations in our interpretation.

Q - Niccolò C. Dalla Palma
Okay. Thank you so much.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Good afternoon – good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my question. I've just
got one question, and again it's on the motor claims inﬂation in Norway. So you've
increased your inﬂation expectation by around 1 percentage point to around 6% today.
So, I'm wondering whether the objective there is to actually stabilize underlying
proﬁtability in motor in 12, 20 months' time, or are you happy for underlying proﬁtability
to decrease because other parts of your portfolio are actually performing quite well,
especially your international operations. And if you look at the headline ratios you are
reporting excluding whether, they are still solid in other parts of your business.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

You are correct. The expected inﬂation now is 6% up from 5%. And as Jostein said, all our
price initiatives this year will meet and at least meet this claims inﬂation expectation going
forward. So measures are taken to increase prices to meet that claims inﬂation. We expect,
however, prices to increase, as I said, even more going forward to compensate for this
claims inﬂation. So, we are not happy to, over time, to reduce the proﬁtability in motor in
Norway. But as we also have said it has been claims inﬂation since end of 2016 to 2017
and we will not catch up with that development. But going forward, we will need the
claims inﬂationary price initiatives.

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone. I've got a couple of questions please. You mentioned that the
winter has been about NOK 250 million to NOK 300 million higher than the average on
the weather claims in Q1. Can you tell us what exactly has been the average winter claims
in Q1 over the last several years?
And then on your tax regulatory changes you mentioned that there's another potential
change coming through that could have a NOK 0.2 billion to NOK 0.6 billion impact.
Could you just describe this further? Give us a bit more detail and let us know whether
this is a one-oﬀ or could be a yearly impact on tax.
And then ﬁnally, you're introducing a new property insurance, property condition
insurance, apologies. Now, is this similar to the Danish change of ownership insurance?
What sort of premiums do you expect to receive in this new line of business and what is
the take-up so far? Thank you.

It's really hard to be very concrete on what the average winter and it's especially in
Norway. I guess they have that wind more or less in Sweden as well, but it's diﬀerent as
you know in Denmark. Last really harsh winter we experienced was in 2010. And that was
a diﬀerent kind though. It was related to temperature and freeze. And I think we also, at
that time and that was the signiﬁcantly lower premium volume, communicated around
NOK 360 million related to that harsh winter.
It was since 2011, 2012 until this winter, it has been very benign and very mild. So if you
compare the winter eﬀects in 2018 to 2017, you are comparing a very harsh winter with a
very benign winter. I guess the normal should be somewhere in between. But it's hard to
actually be very concrete on that going forward. As I communicated, this winter started
very early, and it still snow not – up in the mountains, its huge amount of snow and it has
been very volatile. So this is extraordinary harsh winter. We do not expect that kind of
winter as usual with going forward.

On the tax question, there are two other items in there in addition to the security
provision. And one part is the so-called Norwegian Guarantee provision privy in our
books, has set aside as a deferred tax liability. And that might not be the correct way. So
one of the possible outcomes of the taxation is that there will not be a tax liability
(00:35:25) so it's a positive. (00:35:28) suggested a possibility of increasing the amount
of products, that's included in the Norwegian Guarantee arrangement. Then a guarantee
arrangement for customers in non-life insurance sector, which does not exists in most
places in Europe. And this capital is not included in solvency capital in our perspective
which, in a way, represents some kind of an upside for us as well. That changes now.
And the second part is natural perils capital where we have not satisﬁed deferred tax
liability in our accounts on the assumptions that the tax on this natural perils capital is
never going to materialize because as long as we continue writing property business,
we'll continue to have this natural perils capital in our balance sheet.
The (00:36:18) assumed taxation of proﬁt on natural perils business going forward and
there's a small possibility that might change the weight needs to be existing account, i.e.,
setting up a deferred tax liability and that's being debated. And there's, I would say, a
very small probability that we'll also have a contagious eﬀect on the solvency capital. But
in regard, as I said, that's really unlikely.

Of a brokerage company. We launched this Gjensidige brokerage company in February,
and it's a combination actually of a completely new insurance product in the Norwegian
market. It's a ﬁve-year risk product. We have looked, of course, and we are involved in this
kind of business in Denmark.
In Norway, it has been a completely diﬀerent situation. It has been (00:37:28) products for
the seller and it has been more or less all the insurance companies and a small niche
player called (00:37:35) just been insured, just insured their buyers. So what we have

done here we have created a completely new taxation of properties. We have launched a
very digital brokerage company and we have introduced a completely new risk product
for both sellers and buyers. It has been some learnings from Denmark but it's not the
same product that's in Denmark. It's a completely new concept in the Norwegian market
and it has been very well received and we believe that you will see a change actually in
this market going forward where you will see all the insurance companies following us on
this with a completely new combined insurance product for buyers and sellers.

Good morning. It's Jan Erik from ABG. I just had two questions. The ﬁrst one is a follow-up
on the large – the premiums on the property side and the competition. I saw that you
compete head-on-head with Protector. And on the premium side, how much do you really
think this could be adding to your private lines in Norway.
And the second part is on the price and premium increases in general. On the private
side you may have some further competition from the banks, et cetera, DnB. While on the
Commercial side, it might be easier as Tryg has said that they are willing to give up
business. But just wanted you to tell us about the competitive picture, both on the new
property side and also on the general side. Thank you.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Thank you, Jan Erik. (00:39:33) handle the property insurance concept. So far, it's very
limited. This will take time. We will not compete head-on-head with Protector. It's a
completely new type of product. It's a (00:39:47) risk product. It's a combined – as I said,
combined insurance product composed of sellers and buyers.
Through the brokerage company and this new insurance product, we believe this will be
positive for all the traditional home and content insurance products. So this is the initiative
to secure that they have more dynamics in their home and content process. It's a new
product. That will take time. And it's not directly in competition with the Protector's
(00:40:26) product.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

In terms of competitive situation in private, in general, and in commercial in Norway, I
think so far, we've managed to keep our position very well. If you look at market shares

and so, we are fairly stable. So the picture there hasn't really changed that much over the
last couple of years. It's been quite (00:40:51) have been more aggressive one from their
stable and so our main competitors have been losing and (00:40:58) is stable.
It's hard to predict what's going to happen going forward, but we think that most of these
players will have to prioritize proﬁts before volume and will have seen (00:41:11) the same
way as we have done. We haven't listened to their results yet and I don't think probably
they have started yet either. And but you see as a 35% player, I think it's a safe bet that
they will have to see more the same eﬀects as we have and need to price accordingly. So I
don't really foresee a business short- to medium-term changes in the competitive
position.
In terms of commercial, our results, as you have seen, are (00:41:40) the pressure, and
we've seen that – we communicated that they all really focus on proﬁtability. And it's
always – it's more of a (00:41:49) account that is in the higher end of that Commercial
segment, and it remains to be seen what really happens when the customers are on
tender. But we at least prioritize proﬁtability of volume with margin here.

Just to add, we had the Capital Markets Day back in 2014, and we talked about 1% to 2%
claims inﬂation. What we are talking about today is 6%. It's not just structural changes.
Electric car, hybrid cars, leasing is a completely more dominant concept now compared
to what we saw some few years behind us. We, as you had heard, we will increase prices
with higher price increases going forward compared to what we have done. We are
market leader. We will do this and as we have said several times, proﬁtability before
market share. If this reduce volume a bit, we are prepared to take that as well.
We think we have to increase prices to meet a completely new high volume motor
insurance market in Norway with signiﬁcantly higher claims inﬂation, and the signal is that
we are in the mood of higher price increases going forward with more frequent due to the
new tariﬀ system, more agile.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Thank you. Just one follow-up on the commercial side, is it so that you have seen any
more foreign competition, if you, well, think about the typical Nordic ones? Or is it so that
they are still not apparently here on the commercial side and large corporate side?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

It's the same as we have had all the years (00:43:45). And the texture in some segments
and that's actually the competition.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay. Finally, just remind us on the ﬂooding. Last time it was a big ﬂooding in Norway,
that was 1995 and you were not listed, but you were deﬁnitely an insurance company.
Could you just give us as example of how damaging that was to staﬀ and what has
Page 14 of 19

happened on preconditions measured down in the past? As you said, you have already
done some stuﬀ to prevent the ﬂooding to happen or not to happen, but just to make the
damages less damaging for you. So what have you done and how was 1995 compared to
what you see today?

FINAL

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

1995, that's the biggest one. We had also a ﬂood back in 2011. It was quite signiﬁcant. Just
to remind you, the ﬁgures in 2011, the industry estimates back in 2011 was NOK 200
million, and we had around NOK 65 million. That was in 2011. In 1995, do we have ﬁgures
from 1995? It's a question mark here. No?

Thank you. Our next question comes from Johan Ström from Carnegie.

Q - Johan Ström
Hi. Good morning, guys. So ﬁrst of all, on the claims inﬂation, you're thinking – can you
just conﬁrm that the uptick from 5% to 6% on motor claims inﬂation was driven by the
changes on the bonus system.
And then secondly, on your capital position, the uncertainty related to the PIM model and
maybe a little bit on the tax side has reduced the solvency uncertainties. So, how should

we think about unutilized NOK 1.5 billion to NOK 1.9 billion of subordinated loan capacity?

Yes, it's due to the no exchange and no transfer, no system, so that's easy. In terms of
uncertainty related to them, the Partial Internal Model, as we have said, we kind of
disagree with the assumptions made by the FSA to utilize, for instance, the correlation
from the standard formula between market risk and then (00:46:43) discussed we are
forced to do. But decided against to kind of complaining and not accepting model. We all
respect the model and that's (00:46:53). And then we'll continue our work over time with
FSA and with internally, with our documentation.
But we are able to get more of them – of our internal model approved. And for internal
purposes, as we present to you, these are our own calibration of the internal model with a
slightly higher solvency margin. What we implemented now is some of these
requirements from the FSA, and then as we say in the report, during 2018, there are also a
number of smaller changes we need to do, with everything else equal, will reduce the
solvency margin by 10 percentage points at year-end. But then, of course, we also work at
the same time with our own model and to prove it and discuss with the FSA whether you
can get anything changed there. But that will take time as (00:47:42).
The uncertainties created by the tax hearing in Norway, we think it's highly likely that the
NOK 0.7 billion (00:47:54) solvency due the security provision and that will occur. We also
think it's fairly unlikely that they will have a negative eﬀect from the taxation of the natural
perils capital. We think that is really very unlikely because the natural perils capital stays
with the company as long as it's a going concern. Only if we close for business will that
come to taxation, hopefully that is (00:48:21) and then there is no present value of the said
tax bill.
And then, there ﬁnally was the guarantee provision, as I also took earlier question, there is
both upside and downside to the changes there. But from our solvency perspective, it's
more of an upside than a downside, I think.
The ﬁnal question was on the unutilized capacity for subordinate debt namely then Tier 1
debt. We see as you do, that the market is fairly positive with those kind of (00:48:57)
now. They (00:48:59), that's a spread of 250 basis points. So we follow that market and try
to evaluate the possibilities there, weighed on a continuous basis.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Wajahat Rizvi from Deutsche Bank. Please go
ahead.

Q - Wajahat Rizvi

{BIO 19928187 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning, everyone. Wajahat Rizvi from Deutsche Bank. Can I ask the question
again actually on solvency margins? So, on Partial Internal Model basis, you're looking at
your solvency ratio range of 125% to 175%, though on average, let's say you're 150%. After
this 10 percentage point impact that you have highlighted, you will be almost at that level.
Then on top of that, you have highlighted that EIOPA stress test changes may impact your
solvency negatively by 5 points. And then you have this ongoing drag from the tax
charge, which you have also highlighted.
So, I'm just wondering if we capture all of these things, you will be below the mid-point of
your appetite range. Would you need to change your dividend philosophy or raise capital
or do anything to shore it up or move back in the upper end of the range? Or you are
happy to operate bit more ﬂexibly around the middle of this appetite range? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

I'll start at the back end of your question that we're happy to be and operate ﬂexibly
within that range. We don't see that these uncertainties will have any eﬀect on our
ordinary dividend capacity. So, no.
And the ﬁrst part on the, yes, as we've said, there are 10 percentage points that eﬀect if
everything is implemented. And we think that the NOK 700 million is likely to go through
when the parliament decides ﬁnally on the new tax (00:51:00). But we do think that the
other changes are likely to go through. Remember also, as we're now past what is
historically the most – this is easily the most negative quarter for us and then new build up
accumulated retained earnings over the next three quarters.

Q - Wajahat Rizvi

{BIO 19928187 <GO>}

And can I just ask a follow up on this EOPA comment you have made, the changes, stress
parameters for interest rate risk. So, as I understand, that is on Standard Formula and
given that you have moved to Partial Internal Model, I would have thought you would
have no impact from that change. So why is change to Standard Formula also hitting your
Partial Internal Model?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

That's a very good question. And because we are on the Partial Internal Model on the
non-life insurance business, but with also our pension business and that is on the
Standard Formula. And that is aﬀected. That's why we have these numbers.

Thank you. Our next question comes from (00:52:17). Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi. Just two questions for me. The ﬁrst question is going to be on the guidance. If I
understand correctly, the guidance is not changing. But doing the math around and the
adjustments for the weather and for the release, the reserve release, the quarter was
basically combined with 95% versus 92% last year, so a 300 bps move. That's the ﬁrst
question. Is the math correct on that?
And the second question is going to be how do we reconcile those numbers with an
intact guidance, given that investment income is as well under pressure and the P&C side
has seen combined going up by 890 bps. So, I'm just trying to reconcile the numbers and
see how if we think about that guidance being intact and also the fact that the reserve
release have gone up, how should we anticipate that going forward? I think it's been the
highest quarter almost over the last few years on this side. So, thanks for reconciling the
two sides of the equation here.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

In terms of runoﬀ, I don't really remember if that's the highest level, but our runoﬀ
guidance here is that we do expect, based on planned reserve releases from intensiﬁed –
that was in the reserves of NOK 250 million or NOK 1 billion a year approximately. As
we're working on the balance sheet item of more than NOK 30 billion, there's some
natural volatility around that. In the ﬁrst quarter, as I said, there is kind of one large
(00:54:12) estimate as previous reduced and display some (00:54:15) normal volatility in
the reserve situation which explains the NOK 90 million on top of the NOK 250 million.
Our guidance is the same thing going forward. You should expect around NOK 250
million a quarter with some volatility around that – nature of the business.
In terms of guidance, we don't have a short-term guidance. We only have long-term
ﬁnancial targets and they remain the same and we believe that they are perfectly
achievable with the metrics that we have in place. NOK 90 million to NOK 93 million
excluding runoﬀ, NOK 86 million, NOK 89 million given the current runoﬀ guidance.
And then...

Q - Operator
Just on the runoﬀs, if we can have a bit of – is there any reason of this increase, maybe this
is because that's we are talking about NOK 340 million, so 5.8% versus 4.3% last year.
How should we think about it going forward?

FINAL

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

It's NOK 340 million versus NOK 250 million, which is kind of the deviation from the
guidance. This NOK 90 million, I just explained is partly due to kind of one large loss
provision that has been reduced, and partly has some normal volatility around this. As
explained, this balance sheet item is more than NOK 30 billion with estimates going 20,
30 years into the future, it's naturally somewhat volatile.
