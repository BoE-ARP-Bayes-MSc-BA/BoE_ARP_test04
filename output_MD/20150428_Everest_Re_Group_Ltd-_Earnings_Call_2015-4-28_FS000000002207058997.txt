MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to the First Quarter 2015 Earnings Call of Everest Re
Group Limited. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks
and introductions, I'd like to turn the conference over to Ms. Beth Farrell, Vice President of
Investor Relations. Please go ahead.

Elizabeth B. Farrell

{BIO 1986541 <GO>}

Thank you, Tim. Good morning and welcome to Everest Re Group's first quarter 2015
earnings conference call. On the call with me today are Dom Addesso, the company's
President and Chief Executive Officer; John Doucette, our Chief Underwriting Officer; and
Craig Howie, our Chief Financial Officer.
Before we begin, I will preface our comments by noting that our SEC filings include
extensive disclosures with respect to forward-looking statements. In that regard, I note
that statements made during today's call, which are forward-looking in nature, such as
statements about projections, estimates, expectations and the like, are subject to various
risks.
As you know, actual results could differ materially from current projections or expectations.
Our SEC filings have a full listing of the risks that investors should consider in connection
with such statements.

FINAL

Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Thanks, Beth, and good morning to all. We are pleased to report another excellent
quarter, in fact a record quarter and operating earnings as a result of a strong
underwriting result. All segments of our business contributed positive margin in the
underwriting account.
Quarter-over-quarter underwriting income was up slightly, even though the combined
ratio slipped to 81.9% from 80%. This was a result of higher earned premium in this year's
first quarter compared to last. The increase in the combined ratio was solely in the
reinsurance segments, where competitive conditions are continuing to push rates lower
and commissions higher.
Nevertheless, we have maintained our margins with our strategies of, first, moving our
capacity to better price layers; two, diversifying our exposure; three, expanding
capabilities in new lines of business; four, using capital markets and outlets; and, finally,
maintaining an extremely competitive expense structure.

Bloomberg Transcript

Offsetting the increase in the reinsurance combined ratio was an improvement of over 2
points in the insurance combined ratio. This is due in part to a primary rate environment,
while stable overall is increasing in certain classes. A more significant factor in this
improvement has been the success of efforts over the last couple of years to wind down
portions of the portfolio and reshape the insurance operation.
The build-out of new classes of business along with expanding certain others is beginning
to pay dividends, as growth quarter-over-quarter was 48%, reaching $340 million in 2015.
We still have much more to do in this segment, and we have bolstered our management
and underwriting ranks so that we may continue the progress. In addition, we have
embarked on a process to begin to build out our international insurance presence.
Overall, while operating income was positively impacted by underwriting results, there
were other factors contributing to the record results for the quarter. Foreign exchange
negatively impacted our premiums written, but it had a positive impact on earnings as our
foreign currency-denominated liabilities or loss reserves were converted to the stronger
U.S. dollar.
Also, as Craig will explain, income taxes, quarter-over-quarter, were lower by $12 million.
Investment income quarter-over-quarter was flat, but given where current yields are, we
believe that to be a reasonable result and certainly not unexpected.
Looking forward, the market will remain challenging as competitive pressures persist.
Market movements are difficult to predict and, therefore, we rely on our flexibility to
respond accordingly and modify our tactics as appropriate. These include, as I mentioned
previously, nimbly shifting our capacity, seeking new business opportunities, using thirdparty capital, buying in stock, and staying expense conscious.

FINAL

As a result, we have been able to maintain a strong ROE, which at 18%, is at a meaningful
spread to the market. Consequently, we are uniquely well positioned to manage through
market weakness and, therefore, maintain returns above our cost of capital while others
may not.
The market turn would seem inevitable should it drift down to this level. Until then, we will
maintain our competitive position and continue to be identified by clients, brokers and
analysts as a core lead market reinsurer and meaningful trading partner. In fact, one rating
agency recently cited Everest as one of four reinsurers best positioned to succeed
despite the prevailing market conditions. This attribute is one that has been earned over
the last several years as we have evolved our culture and the portfolio.
New capital and operating income as a result of intelligent underwriting by our teams has
built our capital base to a size where we can deploy meaningful capacity. At the same
time, while building towards $7.7 billion of equity plus third-party capital of $1.7 billion, we
have returned $3.5 billion of capital to shareholders since 2006. This is a record we are
proud of and one that deserves the market's attention.
Thank you, and now to Craig for the financial report.

Craig W. Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

Thank you, Dom, and good morning everyone. Everest had another strong quarter of
earnings with after-tax operating income of $330 million or $7.34 per diluted common
share for the first quarter of 2015. This compares to operating income of $281 million or
$5.93 per share for the first quarter of 2014.
Net income for the first quarter was $323 million or $7.19 per diluted share compared to
$294 million or $6.21 per share in 2014. Net income includes realized capital gains or losses
and represents an annualized return on equity of 18%. Solid underwriting results, sizeable
foreign exchange gains, and a lower income tax rate relative to the first quarter of 2014
contributed to these strong results. All segments reported underwriting gains for the
quarter. Neither this year nor last year included any catastrophe losses in the first quarter.
Total reinsurance reported an underwriting gain of $205 million for the quarter compared
to a $215 million underwriting gain last year. The Insurance segment reported an
underwriting gain of $11 million for the quarter compared to an underwriting gain of $4
million last year. Each year reflected an underwriting loss for crop insurance in the first
quarter due to the seasonality of crop premium against a full quarter of expenses.
The Mt. Logan Re segment reported a $21 million underwriting gain compared to a $10
million underwriting gain in the first quarter of 2014. Everest retained $5 million of income
and $16 million was attributable to the non-controlling interests of this entity in 2015.
The overall underwriting gain for the group was $237 million for the quarter compared to
an underwriting gain of $228 million in the same period last year. Our reported combined
ratio was 81.9% for the quarter compared to 80% in 2014. The overall current year
Page 3 of 21



Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td
Company Ticker: RE US Equity
Date: 2015-04-28

attritional combined ratio of 82% was up from 80.4% at the first quarter of 2014, but
equal to the 82% at year-end 2014. This measure excludes the impact of catastrophes,
reinstatement premiums and prior period loss development.

FINAL

The first quarter commission ratio of 22% was slightly up from 21.5% in the first quarter of
2014, but remained stable compared to year-end 2014. Our low expense ratio of 4.6%
continues to be a major competitive advantage for Everest.
On reserves, our overall quarterly internal reserving metrics remained favorable. For
investments, pre-tax investment income was $123 million for the quarter, on our $17.8
billion investment portfolio. The investment income was essentially flat compared to one
year ago. Despite the declining rates, our investment portfolio continues to perform well.
The pre-tax yield on the overall portfolio was 2.9% with a duration of just under three
years. The quarter reflected $7 million of net after-tax realized capital losses compared to
$13 million of capital gains last year. These losses were mainly attributable to impairments
on the fixed income portfolio in 2015.

Bloomberg Transcript

Foreign exchange is reported in other income. For the first quarter of 2015, foreign
exchange gains were $47 million compared to $2 million of foreign exchange losses in the
first quarter of 2014. This reflects the strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to other
world currencies and equates to about $1 per share this quarter. There were $200,000 of
derivative losses during the first quarter compared to $2 million of derivative losses last
year. This is related to our equity put options and is mostly a function of the change in
interest rates during the first quarter.
On income taxes, the 12% effective tax rate on operating income is on the lower end of
our expected range for the year. The low rate is primarily related to foreign exchange, the
geographic region where the income was earned and higher foreign tax credits. Stable
cash flow continues with operating cash flows of $455 million for the quarter compared to
$367 million in the first quarter of 2014.
Shareholders' equity for the group was $7.7 billion at the end of the first quarter, up $216
million from year end 2014. This is after taking into account capital return through $75
million of share buybacks and the $42 million of dividends paid in the first quarter of 2015.
Book value per share increased 4% to $172.63 from $166.75 at year-end 2014. Our strong
capital position leaves us with capacity to maximize our business opportunities as well as
continue share repurchases.
Thank you. Now John Doucette will provide the operations review.

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

Thank you, Craig. Good morning. As Dom highlighted, we have continued our trend with
another favorable quarterly underwriting result starting off 2015 on a very strong footing.

FINAL

Our group gross written premium for Q1 2015 was $1.4 billion, up 12% from Q1 2014 with
growth coming from segments within both our U.S. and international operations and from
virtually every insurance profit center. This 12% growth would be 14% on a constant foreign
exchange rate basis.
Our group net written premium was $1.3 billion or $56 million, up $56 million or 5% over Q1
2014. Starting with our reinsurance segment, I will cover underwriting results during the
quarter, then provide color on major renewals, predominantly 4/1 including a discussion of
the market and insights on ways we are navigating these challenging time.
For our global reinsurance segments, including both total reinsurance and Logan, gross
premium was $1.1 billion, up 4% or up 7% on a constant foreign exchange rate basis. Net
reinsurance premium was $980 million, down 4% with increased sessions on our
catastrophe business, consistent with our retrocessional strategy.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our reinsurance book including Mt. Logan generated $226 million of underwriting profit in
Q1 2015, a slight increase over Q1 2014. These strong underwriting results validate our
reinsurance strategy, which we have articulated for the last several quarters. Leveraging
our core sustainable strength, including global reach and comprehensive product
offerings, expanding our opportunity set to capture profitable growth and utilizing
additional capital structures to match risk with the most efficient form of capital, while
generating fee income.
April 1 renewals represent approximately 10% of our reinsurance treaty premium. 4/1 is a
key renewal date for Japanese and other Asian business, and for some Latin American
and U.S. regional property business. The reinsurance market remains challenging with
average market rates off between 5% and 15%, depending on the line of business,
product type, and territory.
However, globally, large fires in Japan, Australia and other regions are consolidating their
panels of reinsurers, focusing on a few core trading partners, including Everest. These
sophisticated buyers are not focused strictly on price, but are also seeking stable longterm relationships that can provide both meaningful capacity and comprehensive risk
solutions. This benefits Everest, as we gain preferential signings and in some cases better
than market pricing or terms allowing us to sustain attractive risk-adjusted returns.
Conversely, regional clients around the globe are increasingly placing business locally,
rather than just in global reinsurance subs, especially in the current softening market.
Everest centralized view of risk with a decentralized distribution enables us to capture
local market business. Individually, these deals are not always that large, but in the
aggregate, this is sizeable premium for us, and is more insulated from global competition.
Our strong ratings, longstanding client and broker relationships broadly diversified
portfolio, efficient expense ratio, underwriting expertise, and capital flexibility are critical
elements for achieving better-than-market results.

FINAL

We continually optimize our portfolios, which allows nimble deployment of capital to
where risk adjusted returns are best. At the same time, we are scaling back or declining
deals that do not meet our return hurdle. Where accretive, we use alternative capital
support. This flexible underwriting strategy has mitigated the impact of rate pressures.
Mt. Logan continues to attract strong investor appetite with $60 million of new inflows
from external investors at 4/1, bringing third party capital and Everest funds in Logan to
about $750 million. Logan is one of the fastest growing convergence vehicles, highlighting
Everest's ability to access and deploy third-party capital and improve Everest's internal
returns.
Now, turning to our insurance operations. We wrote $340 million of insurance premium in
Q1 2015, up 48% from last Q1, partially due to prior period negative premium adjustments
in Heartland last Q1. Removing this, our insurance operations'gross written premium for Q1
is up 32% quarter-over-quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

Important to note, this growth is diversified and originating from ten separate insurance
profit centers in a deliberately constructed portfolio of short-tail lines, long-tail lines,
regional, and state-specific insurance portfolios. Now, some detail on the business
composition, and what we are seeing in each market.
California Workers' Comp, one of our largest segments of the insurance book, was
almost $100 million in Q1, up over 20% compared to the prior Q1, and had a 94.3%
combined ratio. Our renewal retention rate stayed relatively steady and pricing remains
favorable with moderating rate. We continue to selectively add underwriting talent to
support growth efforts throughout the state with recent additions to our Northern
California team.
Professional liability premium, largely financial institutions, was $45 million for Q1 2015, up
43% over last Q1. The FI market is stabilizing after a year of price decline, and we
captured several new opportunities, while maintaining a high renewal retention, and grew
with selective expansion to other lines for FI. However, we remain cautious for commercial
D&O, as rate pressures are evident.
Other casualty business, including our environmental and casualty facilities, was up 25% to
approximately $40 million. Our direct facilities are ramping up with new agency
appointments and increased staffing, resulting in increased submission and quote activity,
and driving new business growth. Renewal retention rates are about 80%. We are bullish
on our opportunities in longer-tail insurance line.
Turning to short-tail, including property, DIC and contingency business, written premium
was $65 million, an increase over 60% from last Q1. Focused growth initiatives have been
successful. We added offices and underwriters in Atlanta and Chicago to strategically
grow and geographically diversify our property insurance book, and we plan to further
expand geographically.

FINAL

Specialty Insurance Group, our contingency business, has also expanded offices, hired
underwriters and forged several new strategic partnerships. Six products are highly
complementary to other insurance product offerings providing synergies across line. DIC
premium is flat, as competition has lowered rates and relaxed terms. However, we will
continue to adhere to our pricing targets and leverage our significant capacity to maintain
our position.
Non-standard auto grew over 25% to $26 million with rate increases over 5%. Our
strategic partner, Arrowhead, is providing select geographic expansion opportunity. We
are currently implementing predictive analytics to further enhance this portfolio. Accident
and health premium was up in Q1 with submission and quote activity very high. Our future
deal pipeline for A&H is strong, and we anticipate continued growth throughout 2015.

Bloomberg Transcript

Regarding crop, we compare favorably to last year due to prior-period negative premium
adjustments in 2014. While it is still too early to predict, our final full year crop rating, we
made several strategic hires and are seeing favorable year-over-year volatility factors. We
also could benefit from disruption within several transitioning crop companies.
Overall, the insurance segment ran to a 95.9% combined ratio for Q1, a 2.3%
improvement over last year with meaningful, diverse top line growth. This demonstrates
the success of the strategies to drive profitable growth that we've been communicating
over the last several quarters. We continue to build on our strengthening insurance
franchise through selective hires, both in the U.S. and international. We are bringing
additional products to market, opening new distribution channels, and enhancing existing
ones. We are diversifying geographically as we bolster our relevance to our insurance
customers and key distribution partners and provide meaningful solutions for their
evolving need.
In summary, we have made significant strides over the last couple of years to reposition
our insurance operation as evidenced by the noted improvement in results. We are
poised to take our insurance operations to the next level with our strong and dynamic
insurance team. Reinsurance has long been Everest tradition, but over the next several
years, we will build an insurance operation that will complement our reinsurance franchise
and strengthen and diversify the overall organization.
Thank you and now back to Beth for Q&A.

We'll take our first question from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Good morning. Thank you. And first question is on the recent, some catastrophe losses.
Do you have any potential exposure in the Nepal earthquake, the terrible earthquake that
happened, and also any potential exposure from the riot at Baltimore?

FINAL

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

In terms of Nepal, no. We have no material exposure if any there. In terms of Baltimore, I
don't have an answer for that at this point. Certainly, there might be some risk exposure,
individual risk exposure there, but I would not expect that to be material.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay, thank you. And then on your insurance side, it looks like you're making tremendous
progress out there. I just wonder is the 96%-ish combined ratio, you have said in the past
few years, basically ex some items, the underlying is really, ex-crop, has really run 95%,
96%. Is that kind of like a – still the target combined ratio for the insurance segment going
forward?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

The target combined ratio for the insurance segment would be lower than that. And I
would anticipate that we could continue to drive that combined ratio lower from here.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. My last question is on your capital management, it looks like you have record
earnings for the quarter. The payout ratio is in the 30%s. I just wonder – and also if you
look at first quarter last year, you had much larger buyback. I just wonder, given the market
condition, do you think that the payout should be higher than you currently are paying out
or are you looking for growth opportunities including both organic in the primary insurance
area or potential acquisitions?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Yes, to a couple of those questions. First of all, I think our share repurchase program, we
look at our capital position over a very long time horizon. Certainly, we look to grow the
business where we can profitably, and I think just as an example as we've mentioned in
the prepared comments, we've returned over – almost $4 billion of capital to
shareholders since 2006, almost 40% of that in terms of share repurchases. 40% of our
shares have been repurchased in 2006, so that's a very – that's over a long time horizon.
During that time period, all of us, including yourselves might recall that we've had certainly
significant pressure to buy in more stock certainly from the Street. But what we've been
able to do is balance that out between profitable growth and maintaining sufficient capital
to expand the business profitably, and I think we've demonstrated that, we've been able
to produce a quite respectable and superior return on equity by moving in that direction.

Page 8 of 21



Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td
Company Ticker: RE US Equity
Date: 2015-04-28

FINAL

To your question about going forward, given where the market is today, certainly if the
market continues to slip further from here, we would be less optimistic about premium
growth, and perhaps push a little bit more on the share repurchase. But that is something
that, again, we look at over the very long term. Our purchases of stock in the first quarter,
frankly, we have been in the market, and really the stock just kept moving ahead of our
price targets in the first quarter, otherwise we likely would have purchased a little bit
more.
Again, we don't have any specific targets that we've communicated to the Street, nor do
we intend to. Again, it's always looking at a balance between profitable growth and
maintaining the right level of capital, and those things will always be moving in tandem as
we move forward in time. I hope that answers your question, Kai.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Great. Thank you so much for all of the details.

Operator
We'll take our next question from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Thanks. Just maybe following up a little bit on the insurance book, just trying to – as far as
the growth that came from crop versus your other lines, I think, John, you kind of outlined
some of the specific items, but I know the seasonality of crop is a little bit different. Just
trying to think about how we should be looking at premiums for the rest of the year on an
earned basis? Is there – any context would be really helpful there, thanks.

A - John P. Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

For the overall growth, Michael, the position that has come forth is from a whole bunch of
different areas within that area, and it's across the page. I don't have those numbers
specifically in front of me.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Michael, let's first recognize that the growth year-over-year, we had a premium
adjustment last year, that's kind of amplifying the percentage growth that we're seeing in
that crop number. We won't know the actual premium number, but I wouldn't expect any
huge increase year-over-year as we finish the year, because a couple things are going on.
We would certainly – we do certainly expect to expand. We have expanded our
distribution. We are writing more business in geographically spread with more agents and
more territories, so that's a positive.

Page 9 of 21



Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td
Company Ticker: RE US Equity
Date: 2015-04-28

FINAL

Offsetting that, of course, will be the effects of pricing or expect, effect on premiums
from commodity price declines, so that's a negative to the premium account. And then a
positive will be, as John mentioned in his comments, was the volatility factor which could
help premiums go up. So all that being said, we're not providing a prediction on the
premium, but that gives you some flavor of the factors that will affect the premium
number.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it, okay. And then – thank you. And then, I guess just trying to understand a little bit
more in some of those target areas. Is it because Everest is able to be more tactical in
finding opportunities that you're able to grow and grow at attractive levels of profitability?
Just because some of our other companies are more focused on optimizing retained
books, and we just haven't seen elevated growth. So I'm just trying to understand or
maybe you can give me an example of, if possible, opportunities where you're able to
kind of pick off new business in this sort of low to mid-90%s range, if weather conditions
or there's some displacement in those target areas? Thanks.

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Well, are you referring – is that a question on the insurance operation or reinsurance
operation?

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Mostly on the insurance, just because we had the big stone (32:26) of growth and the
underlying was a couple points better than we had, for example.

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Well, first of all, excluding the impact of crop. I think the number would be insurance
premium growth probably in the low 30%s.

A - Craig W. Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

32%.

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

So let's recognize that first of all.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Second, there are markets that others aren't in, so California comp is one example where
we continue to grow, and that's not something that the rest of the industry is more
broadly speaking, has been a factor in. And we've got a very good position in that
Page 10 of 21

Date: 2015-04-28

FINAL

marketplace, so we're able to grow that. Same thing would apply with respect to
California DIC.
Again, given our appetite predominantly as a reinsurer, that's a risk that we feel nicely fits
into our balance sheet, where with many primary companies it may not. The same thing
would apply to our property ENS operation, which is certainly very strong, up and down
the Northeast Coast or in the East, I should say, up and down the entire Eastern Seaboard.
And so, a lot of companies and distribution partners look to place their property exposure
with A+ carrier. So that's certainly a reason why we're growing.
Same thing would apply in the excess casualty area. Remember that these are not today,
huge businesses but again distribution partners looking for A+ large balance sheet
partners. That's very helpful. And then, finally, in the contingency space, the hiring of a
new team in a specialty niche, again, something that we have built up some unique
expertise in, and not everybody is in it.
Same thing could apply to A&H. I mean, you could go down to each business that we're
involved in, as John mentioned, and you could look to a unique offering that we've made
to the marketplace, a unique appetite that others may not have, and a strong balance
sheet. These are all things that are attractive to distribution partners.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

I see. So in some of these insurance lines, so your rating and your sort of unique appetite,
those are differentiators that allow you to kind of see business and buying business that
may be better than peer profitability?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

That's correct.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Okay. And then one question, Craig, if I could, one more here on the FX impact on the
revaluation reserves. I was just trying to understand, should we be thinking about that
relative to premiums or should we be thinking about that relative to asset marks that run
through AOCI, so, because I was just looking at that. We had a bigger markdown on
assets in the fourth quarter, and then we had a smaller revaluation reserve and then no
real impact on AOCI this quarter relative to last quarter, but then we had the FX impact on
reserves. I was trying to get an idea, should I be thinking about those two next to each
other or should I be thinking about more of the reserves relative to the impact of FX on
premiums? Thanks.

A - Craig W. Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

So Michael, it is more relative to the reserves. But overall, I think, we've mentioned this
before. But we try to maintain an economic neutral position with respect to foreign
exchange, so essentially matching those assets within the local jurisdiction to the same
currency in each jurisdiction.

FINAL

What you have is a mark-to-market type adjustment here at a point in time on the balance
sheet, which is causing what's flowing through the income statement. That's the $47
million gain that you see in other income, other expense line. Offsetting that are foreign
exchange losses that you just mentioned coming through OCI. So on an overall basis, it's
almost completely neutral from a book value standpoint for the quarter.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Okay, so even though – so the AOCI that we see on the balance sheet, that includes the
investment marks and FX and then, but the investment marks were more than the FX
headwind, so that sort of obscured that $46 million that we would have seen on the asset
side?

A - Craig W. Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

That's correct, Michael.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Okay. Great. Thank you.

A - Craig W. Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

You're welcome.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

That means, Michael, in reverse, to the extent that the currency has reversed, of course,
then you'd get kind of the opposite effect. Right. So again, as Craig has highlighted, it's
economic neutral – neutral to book value, essentially.

And we'll take our next question from Josh Shankar with Deutsche Bank.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking questions today. My first question regards to
Kilimanjaro and trying to understand the structure. In the event of a loss that triggers
Kilimanjaro, does Mt. Logan also receive protection under the Kilimanjaro umbrella or is it
just the Everest Re book?

A - John P. Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

Good morning, Josh. It's John. It would just be Everest Re that gets the protection under
Kilimanjaro.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

So – and that would – that also does not include your equity participation – your equity
participation in Mt. Logan is under their terms as well?

FINAL

A - John P. Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

If I understand your question correctly, Everest's participation as an investment in Mt.
Logan stands pair pass with the investors in Mt. Logan.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Okay, excellent. And so now we are through 4/1 renewals, obviously into the big Atlantic
CAT win renewal, but the – I was sort of wondering, when you think about the investors'
appetite for third party capital, now that's a big renewal, is there more room for Mt. Logan
or a similar vehicle to grow in this environment?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Josh, we really can't comment on other vehicles.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I'm saying Everest, does Everest's possible third party participation stand to grow me
guess? Is the appetite for the market broadly out there for more third party capital
participation at current prices?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Well, we can't answer the question tied to Mt. Logan and Everest, and the answer is yes.
We have investors; we've been building our investor base in terms of number of
investors. We have investors that have been looking at it for a long time and a lot of them
it's a slow process in terms of getting comfortable with the underwriting, the team, the
analytics, the portfolio, the construction, the value proposition that we put forth, but
ultimately, we feel bullish that, that will continue as we feel we have built a meaningful and
significant and differentiating proposition for third party capital. So yes, we expect to
continue to have increased appetite into Mt. Logan.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

And does it – equally in the sort of 15% kind of return characteristic business and the 6%
type of return in characteristic or is the demand more so in one area of the market than
the other?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

It's very much – that's a good question. It very much depends on the investor and what
their risk profile is, what their return mandates or targets are, and what their overall
investment philosophy is, so it really depends on which investor and which type of investor
invests in, wants to put money to work in Mt. Logan.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

FINAL

Sorry about all of the Logan questions, I'm always learning. Do you need both kinds of
investors for Mt. Logan to be really successful? Do you need someone to take the
severity risk and someone to take the frequency risk or can you grow one pool without
growing another?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Again, an excellent question. What we've been doing – Mt. Logan is a core strategic part
of Everest Capital Management and property catastrophe management, and we will have
this for many years to come. But it also is not the only thing we do. You mentioned
Kilimanjaro Cat bond. So we balance across the cat bonds, traditional reinsurance
protections, traditional retrocessional protections, ILWs and Mt. Logan and the
combination of those suite of hedges and cat management structures gets Everest to the
what we're comfortable with in terms of a net catastrophe PML position.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Well, excellent answers to all the questions. I appreciate it and congratulations on the
book value growth.

We'll take our next question from Meyer Shields with KBW.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Thanks. Good morning. Two quick reserve questions, if I can. First, Gallagher was
discussing a TPA business and they noted close to 5% existing client claim increases yearover-year. Are you seeing that sort of trend in California workers comp where there's a
spike in claim frequency?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Was that a frequency trend that they saw or a severity trend?

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

That was frequency.

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Page 14 of 21



Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td

I cannot say that we have seen that, no, not that kind of trend.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Is there anything going on, on the severity side?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Not – that has not been what we've seen over the last couple of years. It's been relatively
– I don't want to say benign, but it's consistently emerging in the manner that we
predicted it would in our loss reserve in process.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay, perfect. And then broadly speaking, when you look internationally, underwriting
business outside the United States and you've got these currencies weakening against
United States, does that translate into a higher required loss trend? In other words, do
you have to have, let's say, higher inflation in those other regions?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Not per se. I mean, certainly a lot of what we do overseas is first-party cover, cat exposed
cover. So it's less casualty focused and more property focused. I mean if you think about
global demand, U.S. obviously being the most casualty-intensive place in the globe and, of
course, second behind that would be Europe. But no, not particularly noticing any, or we're
not fearful of any particularly troublesome inflationary trend, no.

Q - Meyer Shields

We'll take our next question from Brian Meredith with UBS.

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Good morning. A couple of questions for you guys. The first one, Craig, was there any FX
impact on the investment income or the fixed income investment income in the quarter?
Or is this decline solely related to just the lower yield?

A - Craig W. Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

That would – so in the investment piece, would actually come through OCI, Brian.

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Craig W. Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}
Page 15 of 21



Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td

And so that's reflected in the number down below the line.

FINAL

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Okay. So nothing would come by. So that's purely just lower investment yields in the
quarter, the 6% decline in the fixed income, okay. Second question, just on the cat losses,
once again, there was a couple of European windstorms kind of at the end of the quarter
that kind of fell into the second quarter. Was there any exposure there and can you tell us
if those were booked if you had any exposure in the first quarter?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

We don't anticipate anything at this point. We're not anticipating any losses getting into
our cat, what we could consider a catastrophe, right?

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you.

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

And we classify a catastrophe as above $10 million.

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay.

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

It doesn't mean we won't have losses, but at this point it's looking as if that would any of
those events would be below $10 million.

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you. So they're going to be relatively modest. Got you. And then, Dom, have you
seen any impact or seen any business yet from this kind of M&A wave that's going on
right now in the reinsurance industry? Or if you're going to see it, when do you expect you
might start to see that, some of the spillover?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Well, you see it in a few pockets. I mean, it's – I would not say that it's – at this point, it's a
huge impact. You do see it in terms of human capital as well though. There's certainly
more chatter in the marketplace about that. And that – it would take many months for it to
have any material impact for sure.

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you. So that's what we should be looking for is like teams of people leaving, and that
could indicate the movement of business?

Page 16 of 21



Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td
Company Ticker: RE US Equity
Date: 2015-04-28

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

FINAL

That would be one factor. It doesn't mean necessarily that we or anyone else frankly
would be picking up teams because we think we have certainly the resources to
underwrite that business. I'm just saying that could be a factor, maybe not for us, but
certainly it could be for others.

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you. And then just lastly, any kind of early thoughts on what you think the Florida
renewals are going to look like?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Well, certainly, there'll be pressure on the Florida renewals. There was some pressure on
what we thought was the appropriate premium base for the cat fund. In fact, we put out a
fairly big line on the cat fund, and we ended up not – our rate was not accepted. And as a
consequence, we took a very tiny line. So if that's any indication, it's possible that the
market could start to fall below what our pricing metrics would be.

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great. Thank you.

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And you have by the way...

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

And by the way, just to give some context to all that, for us, even though we're obviously
listed as one of the largest writers in Florida, a lot of that is pro rata premium. And our
excess of loss premium for the Florida-only companies now, right, which would represent
the June and July type renewals because we do have other Florida exposure coming
from nationals and other sources that have different ex dates. But our XOL business in
Florida is approximately $150 million. So any rate movement that you think about needs to
be thought about in the context of that premium base.

A - John P. Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

And just to add a little more color, we're not sure what's going to happen as we head into
June 1 and July renewals, but we do feel very comfortable that we're positioned well to
execute our plan, how it happens, where it happens and, again, moving, as we've talked
about, go back the last couple of years, we've moved between pro rata and cat very
easily. Risk, we moved from Florida-specific to nationwide covers and super-regional
covers. In terms of deploying more or less relative capacity as we look at those. We write
property insurance in Florida, we write reinsurance, we write retrocessional protections,
we write PURPle. So we have the ability to access Florida exposure in many different ways,
Page 17 of 21



Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td
Company Ticker: RE US Equity
Date: 2015-04-28

and we take advantage of that. And we also have the ability to hedge and manage the
net PML in many different ways as commented on, on one of the previous questions.

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

FINAL

Got you.

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

That's a great point that John makes, and the one offsetting factor to what I've described
is potential rate pressures at least with, obviously, the first client that's come to market,
large client is that there is also some evidence that there will be increased demand
coming from the market. So that could dampen any of the rate pressures that we're all
fearful of. But we will see as the market evolves. But as John described, we have many
different levers to pull and many ways to access profitable business.

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

We'll take our next question from Amit Kumar with Macquarie.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

Thanks, and good morning, and thanks for the call. Just maybe two quick follow-up
questions. The first question maybe goes back to Meyer's question. Is the California comp
book still running at an AOI LR of mid-90%s or has there been any shift in that?

A - Craig W. Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

Yes. That book's still running in the mid 90%s. Amit, this is Craig. And we feel as though
we're seeing exactly what we expected to come out from a reserving perspective. Those
metrics are still running well as well. So that book continues to perform as we would
expect.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

Got it. I guess just going back to Brian's question, in your opening remarks, you were
talking about, I guess, how insurance will complement reinsurance and you're talking
about the franchise. You talked about the other opportunity, but how does M&A factor in
into this picture, or are you more on the sidelines right now?

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

When you say how does this factor into what picture, Amit?

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

In terms of a strategy and if you look at the list of companies out there, who might be
looking for a buyer?

FINAL

A - Craig W. Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

Well, Amit, first of all, we look at many things and we've looked at many things over the
last couple of years. So it's not that M&A is not something that we don't consider, but
clearly as we've looked at many different things over the last couple of years, we've
ultimately determined that the path that we're on relative to what the other opportunities
have been was the best path meaning to build our own platform, continue to build out our
talent, build it one brick at a time so you know what you have. It doesn't preclude looking
at properties that might be a better fit or might allow you to get to a place faster than you
otherwise would, but of course that's all relative to pricing as well. So none of those things
are off the table. But clearly we have, as we've gone through the strategy, time and time
again, we've opted to continue to grow by building it one brick at a time. Something
comes along that's a terrific fit, then we will consider that for sure. But right now we think
we've been able to build the right platform on our own.

Q - Amit Kumar

And we'll take a follow-up question from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Thanks so much for taking the follow-up, just a couple quick ones here, if I could. One
thing I had a question was the tax rate, Craig. I thought normally like when the cats were
lower, the tax rate would be higher just because you had more profitability maybe in the
U.S. Was there something else inside that tax rate and how should we be thinking about
that part?

A - Craig W. Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

Michael, the way that the tax is calculated is based on a full year annualized tax rate.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Craig W. Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td

Date: 2015-04-28

FINAL

It's an effective tax rate for the year. So in essence, we still have catastrophes planned for
the remainder of the year in our plan so that's what goes into calculating the tax. If in fact,
we didn't have catastrophes like we've had in past years, that tax rate will inch up because
you'll have higher taxable income and have to pay higher taxes. But at this point in the
year, it's on the lower end of our range because of the fact that we still have three
quarters of catastrophes planned for the remainder of the year.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it. Okay, great. That makes sense. And then on the international reinsurance segment,
you mentioned some fires, I think, in the prepared comments. How much – could we
quantify how much the sort of one-timer-type stuff impacted the underlying there, or was
it significant? Maybe it wasn't, I don't know.

A - Craig W. Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

For this year, those numbers are not significant from a standpoint of reaching the level of
a catastrophe loss. In other words, it was several fires or several losses that fell below that
$10 million threshold that we have for catastrophe losses, but the number of – the amount
of those fires added up to about $40 million so far this year. Last year, that number was
substantially higher, which is the reason that we increased our loss estimate selection for
the international segment back in the third quarter of 2014. We continue to keep that loss
selection a little bit higher as we go through the year just because of these types of
losses.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it. Great. And then just last one if I could, I mean, just thinking about the cats being a
little bit lower, we get a little benefit tailwind from taxes, the FX item. How should we think
or how do you think about the current ROE relative to your own cost of capital, just given
your own historical context and how you're thinking about results at this point? Thanks.

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Well, clearly at an 18% ROE, we're well above our cost of capital. So I don't know that
that's necessarily a pressing issue. Even though – this may not be answering your question
directly, Michael, and if it's not please follow-up, but it's – we had, as I said, an 18% ROE.
We benefit, of course, from light cat years, but certainly so does the rest of the market.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Right.

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

If you take our expected cat load, which we think about as like 12 points, combined ratio
points, that's about 6 points of ROE.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it. Okay.

FINAL

A - Dominic James Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

And even at that level, we're well above our cost of capital and, clearly, we are
outperforming the market. Frankly, even after that cat load, I would almost argue that
we're outperforming the market even if you put that number in, comparing it to the rest
of the market with no cat. So we're not bumping into or getting close to even at those
levels to our cost of capital. The point I made in my opening comments was that it seems
to me that, as an industry, we are getting pretty close to that, but we are not there yet
and not even there. And so that should have some – you would think it would have some
impact on pricing.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Okay. Got it. Thank you so much for those answers. Really appreciate it. No, it's great,
Dom, thank you so much. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. So I think we're done with the questions. I don't think there's anyone left there with
a question. So let me just thank everybody. In closing, I'd like to emphasize our underlying
core results are strong, both in the reinsurance and in our insurance segments. As I said
clearly, we benefit from light cat years, but again even with an expected cat load we are
still very much outperforming the market. And this frankly is a result of portfolio
diversification and an effective use of capital, both internal and external. As we've kind of
highlighted on this call, and frankly in conversations we've had with many of you previously.
So I'd like to thank you all for your participation on the call and look forward to speaking
with many of you in the weeks ahead. Have a great day. Thank you.
