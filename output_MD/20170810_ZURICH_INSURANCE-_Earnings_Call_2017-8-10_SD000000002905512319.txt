FINAL

Thank you, Richard. Good day, everybody. And thank you for joining us today. These are
good results. I'm very pleased with the ﬁrst half results. This show that we're making
further progress against the targets and the priorities that we indicated to you last
November. If we adjust for the impact of Ogden in the First Quarter, all of our businesses
have contributed positively to the ﬁrst half performance.
On the expense plans, we delivered around $550 million of net savings against 2015
basis. And there is more to come over the remainder of the year. But this is what I would
say, it's good progress on the expense side.
We also made some good progress against the other targets outlined last November. The
return on equity, again stripping oﬀ Ogden, is at 12.5%. So above the indicated target of
12%. And cash is also developing very nicely as expected.

Property & Casualty business. We think we stabilized the business. The top line is showing
slight growth on a like-for-like basis, underpinned by improved retention by new
business. The combined ratio is coming down driven by improvement in administration
expenses and the underlying accident year loss ratio. And this is in a tough market which
remains quite soft in a number of locations around the world.
The life business has continued to deliver excellent results. BOP is up 16% at the ﬁrst half.
And this is very much based on our strategy, focusing on protection and unit linked
products and there is a visible improvement in product mix, which is triggering the higher
margins that we have at the half year.
The Farmers Exchanges also have solid growth in their chosen areas and the combined
ratio in motor, which has been worrying many of you and ourselves for a while, has shown
a sharp improvement as day rate actions have taken eﬀect. Now these trends will continue
to support growth from a Management Services as well as the turnaround of Farmers Re.
Turning to balance sheet. It is very strong today. Z-ECM ratio is at 134%, with strong
operating capital generation of 6percentage points complemented by similar beneﬁts
from market movements and more than -- and this is more than oﬀsetting accrual of the
dividend. Furthermore, we continued to focus on releasing capital from noncore
businesses. And that has allowed us to fully oﬀset the acquisition of the Cover-More Travel
Insurance business on the capital side.
Now let me pause for a second and anticipate your questions or following up on some
questions we received this morning. Let me just remind you that M&A is not a strategic
priority for us. We're not focused on M&A. We don't need to do M&A. We have no gaps
to ﬁll on M&A. And we remain extremely disciplined on our capital and we very well know
that our priority is to deliver on what has been promised in November, which is to
increase shareholder returns over the next years.

Overall, all these results give us conﬁdence that we can maintain the positive momentum
into the second half of year. And so we take them as an encouragement to gain even
more traction in continuing on our eﬀorts to improve the proﬁtability and to deliver on the
3-year targets that you heard us presenting in November last year.

FINAL

We're now ready to take your Q&A. And so it's back to you, Sarah.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) The ﬁrst question is from Farooq Hanif from CrÃ©dit Suisse.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

I'll keep myself to the 2 questions. So ﬁrstly, when you talk about positive momentum
continuing, given the rating environment versus inﬂation, are you not signaling that
maybe some of the underwriting side is going to stabilize and really now it's about
expenses? That's question one. And question two, going to Farmers. As obviously in
Farmers Management Services, there's a bit of an interplay between growth in numbers of
policies versus pricing. So I'm just wondering at what point do you think there will be an
underlying growth in number of policies? Are we sort of hitting an inﬂection point here
and therefore could this be more positive for next year?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mario Greco

{BIO 1754408 <GO>}

Let me start from Farmers and maybe George can help me on the rate environments, your
ﬁrst question. So Farmers is still passing very signiﬁcant rate increases in order to bring
the combined ratio below the 105 and more towards 100. Now optically, the next quarters
will be better benchmark, because we already -- we will already compare ourselves
against quarters where Farmers started or gave customers high rate increases already. But
in order to change the speed of growth of customers, deﬁnitely prices have to stabilize.
As long as they continue seeing high increases in motor rates, this has an impact on new
business and partially on our customer retention, even that is very minimal. And we also
said in some other lines like home. But I think we all agree that proﬁtability is the most
important thing that they have to go after.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Can I add one thing. So just, I think, also on Farmers, Farooq. If you look at trends across
the industry, that also looks substantially better than it has for some time. So we're seeing
loss-cost trend signiﬁcantly improve, both on the frequency and severity. And obviously,
given that, I mean, Farmers have grew signiﬁcant rate last year, they fell for more rate at
the beginning of this year. If that loss-cost element stays somewhat more stable at that
point, that Mario has stated that stabilization proﬁtability will come much more quickly. I
think the overall goal that Farmers have remain the same. So what they're doing on the
price side is they're trying to address the issues that they have, of course, this year and
reach out relatively steady state by the end of 2017. On the more general rate issue topics
of the market. So let me restate the question again to make sure I got it correct. So I
Page 3 of 18



FINAL

mean, are we signaling that given the market conditions that we now expect somehow
the technical performance to somewhat plateau and to look for improvements to come to
exclusively from expense topics. I think the answer to that is no. I think you're absolutely
right about the market conditions. I mean, it's tough. I mean, there are markets that are in
good condition and have diﬀerent drains. But by and large, we see despite positive rate
overall for the portfolio, inﬂation in many of the markets that's running slightly ahead. So I
think as we had anticipated at the Investor Day last year, the market itself will not help us
get to the overall goal. We don't have to sit with just the portfolio that we have. I mean, we
are looking to rebalance the portfolio. We are looking to change the shape over time.
We'll look to emphasize areas, where we believe we see stronger performance and
stronger potential. And we'll use that shift to also beneﬁt the technical performance.

The next question is from Vinit Malhotra from Mediobanca.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Just on the -- just moving to the noncore business campaign for the in-force
management. And I was just wondering is -- I mean, given that this was such a talked
about topic, is it likely to be repeated in the future? Is it -- are there plans to keep doing
this? Because it does look like a noncore unit. But actually it's eﬀectively an achievement
of the company's strategy. The second question is on the one point large losses from
EMEA. George, could you just update us on the man-made insurance program was
tightened? And whether this is adding to those deductibles? Or what's the status in that
case?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thanks, Vinit. So on noncore, I mean, there are 2 things in the quarter that drive the
performance. So one of them is something that you've seen several times before, which is
around the steps that we're taking to reduce our exposure to some of the (inaudible)
annuity product that we have in the legacy portfolio in North America. So you've seen that
repeat in more than 1 quarter over the last probably 5 or 6. I wouldn't necessarily
extrapolate that. I mean, we are looking to get rid of these things, not really intended
they're continual source of proﬁt, nor are they intended to any source of loss. The other
thing we had in the quarter, we had a very small reserve adjustment on one of the
portfolios we just done a study. And again, that is somewhat unpredictable in nature
given the size of the business and noncore. I mean, the easiest way to think in noncore is, I
mean, we would look for blank 0 from that business. I mean, anything we move there is
generally on the exit ramp. And we look to do it economically. But we're looking to get rid
of this stuﬀ. So it's not going to be an outgoing source of proﬁt. On the reinsurance topic,
I mean, you mentioned, obviously, one of the reasons we pointed at half year rather than
to the quarter for large losses is that, I mean, for the half year, we had relatively low; and
Q1 is slightly higher; and Q2 is more balanced over the 6-month period. We do have
some large loss experience in EMEA. Again, it's the nature of the business that we have.
From a reinsurance perspective, it's good news and bad news. And the bad news is that, I
don't believe we'll attach the reinsurance this year. I mean, it obviously depends on what
happens in the second half. But the good news is, I don't expect our large losses to reach
that type of level. And I think if you look at the experience since 2015, when we clearly had
Page 4 of 18



FINAL

Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG
Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2017-08-10

a major issue, I mean, we've not only substantially reduced the absolute level you see an
accident year, x cat loss ratio improvement of, I mean, nearly 3 points. If you look at the
end of the quarter volatility, we're going from 6 points in 2015 to 2 points over the course
of the last 6 quarters. So I mean, obviously, the reinsurance will protect us one day. But
we're looking to weigh the (inaudible) rates in the way that we structure the portfolio to
remove this issue. And I think maybe we'll ﬁnd some success, not that we would never -not that we would ignore the issue of large losses, I think the primary focus today is
actually just outright incremental improvement, that's what we're really trying to drive in
the portfolio.

The next question is from Peter Eliot from Kepler Cheuvreux.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

I'll take my questions on the Z-ECM please actually. The ﬁrst one was, I'll just -- I was
struggling to understand the movements precisely. I guess, the business proﬁt
development is equivalent to about USD 2 billion, which seems -- it seems more than -- a
lot more than earnings. I'm just wondering whether you can sort of split that out a little bit
and conﬁrm whether you think that's sort of sustainable run rate? And also, in terms of the
market sensitivities seems a little bit more than I was expecting. I mean, the equity market
seems to be contributing to about 2 points of the gain, which according to your
sensitivities would have required a rise of about 20%, Maybe I'm just going very wrong on
my math. I just wonder if you can give us a little more guidance on how those changes
have come about? And I guess, the second question is sort of inevitable given the very
strong level of capital that you've got at the moment. I guess that at what point do you
start to address that? And are you able to give us any hints on what's your priorities might
be? I mean, you look into that share in an improving shareholders return, I just wondering
if you can elaborate anymore?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Peter, I'll suggest -- I'll start with the walk through the Z-ECM movement. Again to avoid
any unnecessary volatility, I'll focus on the ﬁrst half rather than just a quarter. So if you look
at where we ended the year at 125%, we've seen an improvement of around 9 points.
About 6 of that comes from business proﬁt. So -- I mean, that's close to the level that you
quoted. If you look at market changes, they drive about 6 points. I think the 2 points that
you referred to is equity and credit rather than just equity and so on. There's a number of
other items that drive those sort of things like foreign exchange. We beneﬁt from some of
the interest rate moves. But the favorable legacy market and credit spreads in practice
between 1 and 2 points in total for both of them. From a business -- and then, of course,
there's dividend accrual and there's some very small increase in insurance risk which
explains the diﬀerence. The dividend accrual is 4 points. On the business proﬁt, I mean,
obviously, it reﬂects more than just the earnings for the quarter. And I'll emphasize maybe
a bit more from the life performance. And for example, given the relatively strong new
business value performance you see in the second half, particularly from the
Bancassurance transaction, I mean, that would be expected to boost the reported result
when we translate into an economic performance. Those are really the drivers. I think the
second point was about capital strength and priorities. I think -- I mean, all I would say
Page 5 of 18



FINAL

Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG
Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2017-08-10

there is that -- I mean, as you've heard from Mario already today and in the press release,
the -- I mean, we have very strong capitalization. It's a fantastic foundation for what we
intend to do around the dividend and earnings. So even with -- I mean, with signiﬁcant
volatility in the market, we would maintain our capital strength and it would pose no
impediment to us whether we intend to one to drive higher earnings and to use that to
drive higher returns and to shareholders through the ordinary dividend. I mean, I think
mid-year is an unusual time to discuss capital topics for me. So I mean, it's a topic we'll
come back to at the end of the year.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Could I just maybe follow-up very quickly. The 6percentage points of business proﬁt, you
said that's a pretty good sort of sustainable underlying ﬁgure?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

I think it's partly dependent on -- I mean, what happens in the life business, because, of
course, there's a capitalized element there. So it can be a touch volatile. But I think if you
look at life, in particular both on a bulk and an economic basis in Q2, I mean, very strong
performance, not dependent on one-oﬀs. We're very happy with what we see there. I
think that's a strong and (inaudible) for the future.

The next question is from Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous.

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Two simple questions, I think. First of all, there's a lot of moving parts in the combined
ratio half year, quarter, quarterly, et cetera. Maybe, George, you could just give us a view
as to what you think "normalized combined ratios" running out? I'm thinking relative to
sort of 99, strike a 100 it was running at last year versus the 97.5 sort of soft target for full
year '17. It's very hard to know. I mean, given all the moving parts. So just what's your
view? What is the current run rate of normalized combined? Secondly on cost saves. I
think the plan was to achieve an additional 400 this year, you're actually running slight
ahead of that I suppose at the half year. Do you think you're actually running ahead? Is
that just sort of timing issue? And maybe qualitatively, the achievement of the cost saves,
is it easier or harder than you thought? Are you discovering any more things that are
interesting in terms of potential? And just to clarify, if I look at the absolute admin
expenses in non-life, all the movement there is cost saves. There's nothing else going on.
Obviously, they came down quite a lot quarter-on-quarter.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So ﬁrst of all on the normalized numbers, there's a lot of diﬀerent ﬁgures it's relatively
easy to be confused and it's really relatively easy to choose the number that you prefer. I
mean, I'll tell you how to look at it. I mean, I think if you took the quarter and you would
do what I would normally suggest, which would be PYD and cat, I mean, you'd get a much
higher number than the one that we believe we're currently running at. There are a
number of smaller items, I'll touch on them in a second. But are one of the reasons why I
Page 6 of 18



FINAL

Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG
Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2017-08-10

don't think that's particularly good guide in Q2. I think to make that clear that that's not
cherry picking, the -- I mean, we did the same thing in Q1. So we tried to steer everyone
away from doing a straight normalization in Q1, because you would have ended with the
number that was too low for us. So -- and I mean, the principal driver of that was large
losses where we're not far away from planned that late Q1 that we have a relatively simple
reverse of that by Q2. I think if -- I mean, if you allow for the fact that large is slightly high
and you allow also for the fact that the commission ratio through the ﬁrst half is tilted by
correction in Europe. I mean, it's -- that 0.2, 0.3. And I think on the ﬂip side, if you also
allow for the fact that we have some seasonality in expenses. And while well the cost
program will continue to lead in the second (inaudible). Maybe you do have a better
seasonal pattern that you've seen before and you will see to some degree continue into
the second half of this year. That would mean that the expense ratio, all things being
equal in Q2, it's going to be a touch low. I think if you allow for all of them, we would see
an underlying combined ratio that's around that 98 level. I mean, not far away from the
half year combined x-Ogden. So that's roughly where we think we are at the moment.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mario Greco

{BIO 1754408 <GO>}

So Andrew, on the cost side. So ﬁrst of all, we wanted to have an accelerated
development of the beneﬁts, because both which are intentionally and for you guys
outside of the company having back end loaded plan wouldn't work. So we are where we
wanted to be. By year-end, we would like to be above the mid-range of this target. And
we think we can get there, which would give us further comfort to that -- a big chunk of
the program has been done in the initial two years. On how tough or diﬃcult it is, look it is
deﬁnitely much more challenging and much more complex to reduce the combined ratio
than actually just cost. Cost is about discipline and focus. And so we activated the
process. We'll continue with that. You asked if we found further ways do it. And I think,
yes, every day we ﬁnd some more initiatives, some more chances to reduce the cost.
What is important with that, again internally and for all of you guys, I think we are showing
discipline and we are showing that we walk the talk. We indicated the targets and we are
delivering quarter-by-quarter.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

I want to point that how much of the P&C expense (inaudible) is I think sustainable cost
reduction given the move that you can see. I mean, what you see in the expense ratio, it's
a combination of lower charges from the center which are absolutely sustainable and the
impacts of action that we're taking already last year and the early part of this year in P&C.
So that there's no signiﬁcant one-oﬀ expense (inaudible).

The next question is from Dhruv Gahlaut from HSBC.

Q - Dhruv Gahlaut

{BIO 16209870 <GO>}

Two questions. First, going through the North American commercial business, could you
say a few words in terms of how price is developing with respect to claim inﬂation on that
book at this point of time? Second, you reiterated your guidance in terms of the cash ﬂow

Page 7 of 18

over the next three years period. Could you say how that is looking in the 1H, I'm
assuming fair amount is -- will get limited in the 1H for your guys?

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So on the North American commercial market, ﬁxed rate versus lost-cost inﬂation. I mean,
you probably picked the -- one of the parts with portfolio that has some of the bigger
challenges also from a market perspective. So I think if we look at the overall today and
again compare it to the assumptions that we would have had when we put together the
targets that we discussed at the Investor Day last year, I think we would have anticipated
slightly more rate and slightly less inﬂation in North America and we see a bit less rate and
a bit more inﬂation. And if you look at it by line rate, it's particularly troublesome still
around property and also to some degree around workers' comp. Inﬂation, I mean, higher
generally across-the-board. But again the liability-wise, particularly the motor-related
business shows, I mean, relatively healthy lost-cost inﬂation. Having said that, not to leave
it just on an absolute negative. I mean, that is oﬀset by what we see elsewhere in the
portfolio. And if we redrew the picture today, I'm not sure that sum total will signiﬁcantly
change. But you see an expectation sort of that contribution from the U.S. and maybe
more from Europe. And if you look, I mean, again even more recently in Q2, we see APAC
nicely contributing pretty strongly and the Australian markets are starting to turn to some
degree. So I mean, overall, we're not far away from what we thought we're going to be in
November, albeit the components are maybe a bit diﬀerent. From a cash ﬂow
perspective, I mean, Mario commented that we are absolutely on track. We're very happy
with what's happening around cash ﬂow. We'll update you again at the year-end. But we
are very conﬁdent that we will deliver more than the $9.5 billion that we have committed
at the Investor Day last year.

Operator
The next question is from Nadine van der Meulen from Morgan Stanley.

Q - Nadine Adrienne Marion van der Meulen

{BIO 15200446 <GO>}

Two quick questions from my side. You just talked about the expenses. On the
restructuring costs or restructuring provisions, they were down quite a bit in the Second
Quarter. Do you still guide -- or maybe you can remind us again on the guidance you
gave for that. Is it still around $500 million for 2018? Then the second question is on the
dividend. So the current dividend policy of 75% earnings payout ratio are maintained with
CHF 17, whichever is the higher. You emphasized or you mentioned in the past that the
dividend is based on forward-looking earnings or could be based on forward-looking
earnings. I was wondering, given the sort of strong capital of the group and the earnings
growth that you are continuing to show, do you see the possibility to increase the current
'17 dividend, whilst having a temporary payout ratio of about 75%?

A - Mario Greco

{BIO 1754408 <GO>}

No. We're looking in the eyes, George and I on who should tackle this question. Okay. I
think it is my turn. So look, it's clearly early to talk about dividends. So George said that
before. I mean, we can't talk in August about the dividends for the year. Deﬁnitely, the
year has been progressing well. So what we see is that we have signiﬁcant performance
Page 8 of 18

improvement. If this momentum has continued through the year and if this performance
improvement make us conﬁdent that we can keep running the business with this higher
level of proﬁtability or even better and considering the capital situation, we will carefully
look at the dividends by year-end. But it's really too early to say. In the horizon of the plan,
there is no doubt that the plan brings us to reward shareholders in a better way. And so
it's more a question on execution and speed of execution of the plan than about what will
get done by us over the time. Sorry that I cannot add more to that.

Q - Nadine Adrienne Marion van der Meulen

{BIO 15200446 <GO>}

No. This is already quite helpful.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Nothing on the ﬁrst part of your question around expense and particularly the
restructuring topic. So I mean, it has been a slightly quieter quarter from a restructuring
perspective in Q2 than the linear run rate would suggest. We're not changing guidance.
We said it won't be more than $500 million. I don't expect to be very substantially less
than $500 million. So we'll be within that $500 million level. Just one point I want to ﬂag
ahead of time. Given the deﬁnitional requirements for restructuring from an accounting
perspective, we may see some of the restructuring (inaudible) go through BOP in the
second half. So you may see up to 150 run through BOP. But we still expect the total
economic restructuring to be within the $500 million guidance.

The next question is from James Shuck from Citigroup.

Q - James Austin Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Two questions from my side. I'm kind of going to give up trying to get answers to the
question about returning capital and what your plans are around the dividend. But I
would like to just ask kind of theoretical view of what is actually possible. Because you've
got 134% Z-ECM. You actually run -- 100 to 120 is the target. If you just take the kind of
midpoint of that level, you get many billions of theoretically usable surplus. And I guess
I'd just like to get your thoughts on what are the binding constraints when it comes to
actually distributing or the potential to distribute or deploy that capital. Is it rating
agencies? Is it SST? Is it central liquidity? If you could just update on that, that would be
great.
Secondly, on the U.S. commercial. There's been a bunch of repositioning of the portfolio
in that territory, particularly kind of around deepening customer relationships and moving
into new areas and trying to take some of the volatility out of it. If you could just update on
where you are with that. Obviously, the competition's got much stronger in the larger
ends. I'm interested in what you're doing at the micro end. You've seen a number of your
competitors make acquisitions and start to move into that segment. So I don't think you
have so far. So just an update on what's happening on U.S. commercial would be helpful.

So a good try. And if I can't satisfy you with the answer -- but it's a good try on capital and
dividends. I guess, what I would ﬁrst like to remind you is that there is volatility in this
capital ratios. At year-end over the last four years, we've been almost in a very narrow
range between $120 million, $122 million in each single year. Today, it's $134 million. Part
of it is due to market movements that can change. And part of it is due to our actions into
the business proﬁtability. I don't think that we're focused -- that we have focused
ourselves on capital returning or excess capital when we presented the strategy. We
focused on dividends. And we committed to have a clear payout ratio policy and we
spoke about achieving the capacity to improve on the dividends. And this is still where we
are. I mean, we're glad that the capital is moving this way. We're glad that we're ﬁnding
ways to protect and improve our capital position. But our commitment -- the ﬁrst
commitment we have is to show that we can establish a positive dividend growth after so
many years.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

I would like to add one comment. So James, I think there was a -- part of your question,
which was asking about whether there was a hidden constraint that we haven't disclosed.
So I mean, the -- as you'd expect, ordinarily, rating agencies tend to be a more signiﬁcant
constraint than some of the internal models. Liquidity is no constraint for us. I think,
though, if you look at the overall -- I mean, we certainly have more balance between all
the measures than I've seen for some time. So there's nothing that we're not showing you
that wouldn't materially change the picture.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - James Austin Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

I guess, if I can just very quickly -- you have a target range of 100 to 120. That's meant to
allow for the volatility as is. So at some stage, you've got to manage yourself to the
midpoint of that range, I would guess. So or you need to revisit the capital management
framework.

A - Mario Greco

{BIO 1754408 <GO>}

And we will at some stage, as you said. But in the meantime, let us deliver on what we
promise, which is based on dividends. And this is what we owe you all. And this is our ﬁrst
priority, to show that proﬁtability can allow us, by gaining momentum, by maintaining
positive momentum to have a more rewarding dividend policy. That is our priority #1.
On U.S. retention and customers. I mean, I think if there is one thing which is undisputed
at ZÃ¼rich's strength is that -- the customer management system and the customer
services. We are still enhancing it. And the good thing is that we see retention moving up
in U.S. and in Europe on our midsize companies and our commercial companies. We see
lots of opportunities for further cross-selling. We're carefully exploring client-by-client,
account-by-account. You know that we have 1,000 clients which are managed individually
by account managers. And for each one of them, on a name basis, will look at how many
products that we have sold them, what are we missing, what else can we sell them? And
that I think is much more eﬀective than going through acquisitions. We don't need
acquisitions for that, not at all. We need to work ordinarily day-by-day and with
methodical pressure on knowing our portfolios and bringing the oﬀers to the customers.
And that is working well. This is one of the things where the traction is visible internally.

The next question is from Thomas Seidl from Bernstein.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

I come back to this combined ratio point because it's so important for ZÃ¼rich, obviously.
So at half year, you had 97.8. George, as you said, compared to last year half year, you
have a similar period. You had 0.9 higher reserve, 0.5 lower cap, a few one-oﬀs. But it
seems that the combined ratio, that is stable, if not slightly. And notching upwards. And
you want to get to 95 to 96. This is what the market also has started to expect from you. I
wonder how you get for the next two years to the 95%, 96% level. Question 1.
Question 2 is on reserves. You have this Ogden hit, $289 million. You did a lot higher
reserve leases in this quarter, the highest since 2014. And still you say that the reserve
adequacy is unchanged to the date. I mean, (inaudible) has this morning basically
reported a similar number for Ogden but has clearly said that this -- their reserves trends
negatively as one would expect. So I wonder why this is not the case at ZÃ¼rich.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So on the ﬁrst one, Thomas, on the combined ratio. I mean, I think I said in response to
Andrew's question earlier that -- I mean, there are -- there's a lot of numbers around the
combined ratio. I mean, you can choose how you prefer to assemble them. I think the way
I see it and the way I would suggest that others look at it is that if you look at the
performance for the half -- I think that's a better starting point x Ogden. If you prefer to
start from the quarterly combined ratio and normalize it, I think you also need to allow for
some of the -- I mean, not one-oﬀ. But some of the more unusual elements that are in the
result. In the same way that I discounted the positive large loss experience in Q1, I slightly
discount the negative large loss experience in Q2. The half is just a bear guide. So again, I
mean, if we allow for that, we allow for the commission one-oﬀ, we would see ourselves
around the 98 level.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Which basically leaves you 2percentage point to improve over the next year as a
minimum. So how do you get there?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So -- I mean, as Mario said earlier, we make good progress on the expense program. But
we're by no means done. So I mean, we still have the second of $1 billion to deliver. And
you know the proposals of the group and you know how much of that will beneﬁt the P&C
business. So even if you discount the comment I made earlier about portfolio
management being used to more than oﬀset the impact to some of the market softness, I
mean, that expense ratio on its own is a very signiﬁcant state. And taking the combined
ratio, that's exactly in the range that you just quoted.

On the reserving topic, as you saw from us, we took the full charge, I mean, back in Q1.
Well we took the -- part of the charge based on the same announcement from the
government in the U.K. And that clearly had an impact on our reserving position because
we simply let it ﬂow through. We had indicated earlier that through the course of this year,
we expected that we could absorb it within a normal 1% to 2% PYD. What that means is
achieve 1% to 2% after the absorption of Ogden. As you've seen from us in prior quarters - and the growth reserve releases have run slightly higher than the ones that we've
typically released over time. I mean, we have a bit of that again in Q2. So while I had
expected that it would take us probably more of a year to absorb the full impact of
Ogden, I mean, here we are at the end of Q2. And we have absorbed it and we are back
at our targeted PYD range with no adverse impact on the group's reserve strength. I
would not expect that PYD would run at that same 3% level for the next 2 quarters. You
should expect to see something back more consistent with what you've seen from us
before.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

I think what's slightly confusing is you did a higher reserve and still you said -- to oﬀset
Ogden, obviously, to get to the 1percentage point net and still you say the reserve
adequacy stays unchanged. How...

Bloomberg Transcript

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yes. It's important to remember that a number of diﬀerent things drive reserve strength.
So of course, there are -- there's a reserve strength that you start with and there's the
reserve -- the reserve strength that's changed by facts and information that comes to your
attention during the course of the quarter. And I think you can see within the PYD that -- I
mean, we have some notable one-oﬀs, for example, in New Zealand. And the change that
was made there. So at the beginning of the quarter, that would not have formed part of
reserve strength. But if we have left it, at the end of the quarter, it would have. So that
partly explains why you see the signiﬁcant PYD. But with no impact on reserve strength.

The next question is from Ralph Hebgen from KBW.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

It's actually only one question, I'm going back to the combined ratio. And speciﬁcally the
component, which is the accident year loss ratio before net cuts. I appreciate all your
comments. And I understand that it will be just some point, even arbitrary or discretionary
to take the combined ratio apart. And yet it is cut oﬀ thicker, the increase in the accident
year loss ratio from 64.5% in 2Q; '16, to 66.3%. So any comment there would help. And
perhaps -- what I have in mind is perhaps something like the normalized expectation of
large losses. We're following the implementation of the various management initiatives.
You would not expect some of the large losses to run. Then perhaps you could indicate
where 2Q '17 runs against the benchmark compared to where 1Q '17 ran and where 2Q '16
was, if that makes sense. I mean, I'm just groping around a little bit trying to get a
benchmark against which I can measure or gauge where the dynamic, the underlying
dynamic of the loss cost and the loss ratios are.

FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So I think the ﬁrst point, Ralph, is that you point to the answer in the question. The
comparison of Q2 this year to Q2 last year is heavily impacted by the point that you make.
I mean, we had a very, very benign quarter in Q2 of 2016. And we've had a very slightly
heavy quarter in Q2 of '17. I mean, again, I think I also mentioned in response to an earlier
question that -- I mean, despite that, we've been in a relatively tight band. So if you look at
us over the course of the, I think the last 6 quarters, I mean, since we've started making
changes both to the way we underwrite to the risk selection and to the reinsurance. I
mean, you've seen the accident year loss ratio x cat move in a band. It's around 2 points. I
mean, if you look at Q2 2016, that's probably the low point. If you look at it again today, I
think we are at or around the high point. I mean, I think that type of variation -- if you take
high to low over I mean 1.5 years, it's not impossible to see that type of move, given the
kind of business that we have.
As far as benchmark goes, I'd point you back to what I said both in response to Andrew
and just a second ago to Thomas. I mean, if you allow for what we see as slightly largerthan-expected large losses, I don't want to make a huge deal of it. If you compare that to
what you see as a normal normalization -- if that's not too much of a twist. I mean, we
would see ourselves around 98%. And that would give you an immediate sense of what
we would believe the excess large loss on the quarter to be. But that can pass. And yearover-year is driven by one very benign quarter versus a slightly heavier quarter.

The next question is from Paul De'Ath, RBC.

Q - Paul De'Ath
And another question, sorry, on the combined ratio. More speciﬁcally, looking at the
commission ratio. So I think, George, you mentioned that part of the increase in the
commission ratio was a correction and -- this time around. But then there's obviously an
element of it, sorry, that is due to mix. And I guess going back to this point of how do you
see that in relation to then the loss ratio? So if you say your 0.7 possibly points of
movement down to mix on the commission ratio, should we expect a kind of reciprocal
movement on the loss ratio? And that's kind of the ﬁrst point.
Then the second one was just going back to Ogden. And obviously, there's potential that
we get further moves in the Ogden rate later in the year. And obviously, any comment on
that would be gratefully received. But assuming it moves in the right direction, is that just
an additional bonus in terms of numbers for you guys in the second half or whenever it
comes?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

The only thing I will say that it you are completely tenacious around this commission topic.
You checked this with me the last time we had this conversation. I mean, you make a very
good point. I mean, we have talked about the mix of business driving this. I mean, we do
expect to see improvements in performance. I mean, if I -- again, if I point to the things
that -- maybe start with the numbers ﬁrst. So I mean, we're -- commission ratio is up by
Page 13 of 18

about 1.5 points. Bulk of that -- I mean, the vast bulk of that is business mix. And there's a
small piece of it, which is that commission adjustment, that's -- I referred to earlier, about
2/10, 3/10 of a point in the quarter. Within -- and that's a one-oﬀ. We do not expect that to
recur. Within the business mix, a number of diﬀerent drivers. So I mean, we've been
successful in Latin America. It's driving growth in the mass consumer business. If that
opportunity continues to present itself to us in a way that we drive proﬁtability, we would
continue to take it. The characteristics over the businesses that it has higher commission
levels was typically lower and typically far more stable loss ratios. I mean, I can't
scientiﬁcally point you today that this drives that. So I'm sure there's a piece of what we
see in the commission, which is showing up in the loss ration improvement. I think just as
importantly, probably the stability that I've referred to earlier -- I mean, I think we'd all like
it to be more. I mean, one of the beneﬁts of that business mix shift is more stability in the
group's performance. And that's something we will continue to pursue in the future,
assuming that, that opportunity was proﬁtable.
The other big driver of it is actually in the U.S. I mean, as you know, the more competitive
end of the market is the large commercial. Typically, it comes at much lower cost of
acquisition. I mean, we've continued to prune that book, at the edges. That's been oﬀset
by growth in the Direct Markets book, which for us the F&I business and the Surety book. I
mean, they both carry much heavier commission rates than the commercial book. I mean,
one additional comment on that -- and that's -- I mean, ordinarily, we'd expect those
businesses to be again of characteristics closer to the, I'm going to say the mass
consumer than the large corporate commercial, which would be more exposed on peak
risks. I mean, it was a relatively diﬃcult quarter for some of the direct markets business
because they were more impacted by the cat experience that we've seen in Q2. So that's
somewhat dampened the ability to bring down the overall combined ratio for the quarter.
But I mean, that's something we are driving towards. And I would hope that we could
demonstrate that more clearly as we move through the year and we have a bit more
experience behind us.
On your second point on Ogden. I mean, really diﬃcult to say anything on that today. I
mean, from an information ﬂow perspective, I think -- I mean, you guys point to it at least
as much as I do at this stage. There was an expectation of an announcement last week,
which has been postponed. As far as I'm aware, no subsequent date has been
established. Obviously, Ogden as a topic is a major event for the U.K. market. It's a
relatively substantial (inaudible) -- it's on rates. As to how much, when, even if the U.K.
government would come forward with a diﬀerent proposal, I mean, my guess today is as
good as yours.

The next question is from Niccolo Dalla-Palma from Exane BNP Paribas.

Q - Niccolo Cornelis Modesto Dalla-Palma
My ﬁrst question is on top line. Clearly, good news to see that the like-for-like top line has
been stabilizing and P&C both in Q1 -- I mean, Q2 actually slightly up, you mentioned. I
just wondered if you could tell us, is this still requiring above-normal eﬀort to keep it
stable, especially on the commercial side, I guess, from the management? Because my

understanding was that your eﬀorts to show you -- you're there to write business where
more important than in the business-as-usual situation. Just wondered if that -- where we
are in that.
Then the second question is: If you could run on -- as for the impact on earnings from -speciﬁcally, from the Banco Sabadell deal, what impact should we expect from here? But
also cover more group, if you could run us through today. Given your expectations of the
increase of insurance on that book, what should probably impact of these 2 transactions
for the remainder of the year and going forward?

A - Mario Greco

{BIO 1754408 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So Niccolo, I start. This is Mario. I start with the sales in commercial question you raise.
And then I leave it to George on the Sabadell impact.
On sales in commercial. So it's not really an extraordinary eﬀort that was needed. But
deﬁnitely, we have been in changing transition also for the organization. We uniﬁed the
organization of commercial and corporate almost a year ago or some quarters ago. And
we uniﬁed also the management in each country. That initially created some distress in
the people and in the sales organization, which is now over. So the better situation we
have now is that we're settling down with the long-term organization that we want to
have. People have the roles, people feel good about the roles. And that is naturally
facilitating them going back to customers' markets and growth initiatives. And I think that
this will continue. I'm quite positive that this will give us a further boost later on. But still
extremely careful. We know that the markets are quite soft. And so we're doing only the
things that we want to do with the customers. But the power of the engine is back in
place.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

On the impact of the 2 transactions. So Sabadell will have, I mean, an immaterial negative
impact on life earnings. Obviously, part of the transaction is to capitalize a future earnings
stream and dispose of it. But I don't expect that to be signiﬁcant in the context of reported
earnings. Cover more this year. I mean, it will have some impact. Of course, there's some
initial upfront cost that we'll incur. So expectations this year are relatively low. I mean, we
price these transactions. But we don't price individual transactions. But we set huddle
rates for the transactions that we'd be expecting to achieve ROIs, a minimum level of 10
and perhaps higher, depending on the risk proﬁle of the transaction. I mean, you can
apply that same growth to cover more.

Q - Niccolo Cornelis Modesto Dalla-Palma
Sorry for a small follow-up. On Banco Sabadell, do you expect that capital to be released
up to group? Or is that ﬁrst not in your hands and secondly, not in today's plan also for
cash remittance?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

That's a really good question. I mean, as you heard earlier, there's no signiﬁcant capital
beneﬁt to us from the transaction because of the diﬀerent treatment between Solvency II

and SST. It would therefore be -- I mean, even though we're not in control of it. And it's
subject to regulatory approval. I mean, the beneﬁt to us would be the cash ﬂow, assuming
that the business was to receive approval to make that additional payment to us. Given
the uncertainty of something like that type of transaction, that would not have been in our
initial plan.

The next question is from Michael Huttner from JPMorgan.

Q - Michael Igor Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

On the organic capital generation, could you just say -- give a little bit more granularity.
Looking at the BOPAT report, it was $1.66 billion taxed. And you said the proﬁt ﬁgure,
which was mentioned, the organic capital generation, is just under $2 billion. So there's a
gap of about $200 million. And you said that's capitalized less the cost. And I just
wondered if you can say a bit more about that?
Then the second. You talked about mix of businesses and you gave some examples. Is
there any way that -- for us to follow it? I mean, the examples you talk about are fantastic
and it's lovely granularity. But is there anything that we can see in the slides or the
supplemental information where we can say, aha, here's -- I can track it myself, here's a
mix shift that I can see and it's really lovely.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thank you, Michael. So on the ﬁrst question, it's a bit diﬃcult to give you much more than
I gave an answer to the earlier question. So I mean, I don't have a bridge in front of me
that I could give you it point-by-point. But I mean, the key diﬀerence between the
reporting earnings that you can see and the impact that we have in that Z-ECM ratio
essentially is the new business value in life. That's the main explanation of the diﬀerence.

Q - Michael Igor Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

And the Ogden is deducted from both?

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

On the second topic, I suspect that we'll have to have a look. It would be relatively diﬃcult
to substantiate my comments from the disclosure that we make. I think you can use some
proxies but they won't. I mean, we -- you have a commercial segment where you can see
the change in volume and the impact on the expense ratio there. Brazil, it's not solely
mass consumer. But it certainly dominates the overall portfolio. I think Richard and I will
have to have a look and see if there's something we can do that's more helpful around
that mix topic. So I mean, yes, I think you couldn't bridge it from what we gave you today
other than my comments.

Q - Michael Igor Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Okay. And if I think about the bigger picture about the mix shift, you say at the -- when

do like, 2018. Where are you now?

We've certainly improved (inaudible) where we are in that continuum. I'm not sure it ever
rains is the problem, isn't it? So you're always looking at the portfolio again and thinking
that there's further steps I could take to improve it. So I don't think -- there's never a
landing point in, at least in...
That's the last question we have on the call. So thank you all very much for joining us

Just before we close the call, I want to point out something that's in the press release
