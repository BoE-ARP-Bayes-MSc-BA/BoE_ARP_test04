Good morning, and thank you for the introduction Brett. Welcome to everyone on the call.
We filed a short slide deck this morning that is also posted on our website. I'll refer to
certain slides at various points in my prepared remarks. Today, I will speak to you about
some of the Strategic progress we have made over the recent months and our plans for
the future. I will also discuss some of the positive signs we are seeing in the market
environment and comment on our results for the quarter. Since I last reported to you and
throughout the year we have made significant progress as a company.
Slide 3 provides a summary of some of our key achievements. There are five key projects
where I am pleased to report additional detail. As we announced yesterday, we have
entered into an agreement to sell our reinsurance business Ariel Re. We expect the
transaction to close later this year subject to certain regulatory approvals.

Bloomberg Transcript

We have also made progress on a plan to exit our Underwriting operations in Continental
Europe outside of Lloyd's. This includes our Platforms in Italy and Malta. In Italy, we are
closing -- close to finalizing an agreement to transfer employees and sell our operations
to a third party. In Malta, we have stopped writing new business altogether. We will
continue to evaluate options for the business going forward. In the U.S. we have decided
to put our grocery and retail business unit into runoff. We have not been able to achieve
either the scale or returns to continue to invest in the business.
Finally three weeks ago we announced entering into a reinsurance to close transaction for
Syndicate 1200's reserves for the 2017 and prior years. In total the business I just outlined
represents over $400 million of annual gross premiums all but approximately $30 million
of this comes from our International operations.
I would note on a net basis the impact on premiums and underwriting results is less
meaningful. These businesses in total represent approximately $175 million of net
premium including approximately $75 million from Aeriel Re. As we've discussed
previously we are constantly reviewing the best uses for our capital to produce the best
possible returns. This series of announcements does not mean we are done.
We continually review businesses that are underperforming or not aligned to our strategy
and we will pursue options to maximize value for Argo and redeploy our Capital
elsewhere. These actions reflect a lot of hard work from many of my colleagues since the
start of the year. This represents an important step in our journey to becoming a highperforming U.S. focused specialty insurer.
We know we are not there yet and there is plenty of work ahead of us, but I'm excited
about the progress we have made. Exiting these businesses will free up capital, resources
and management time to focus on our strategic growth areas. As we and many in the
industry have reported, underwriting conditions remain attractive across many lines we
operate in. Our strategy is to focus resources on the highest returning areas and these
strategic actions help support that goal.

FINAL

I would also note that the reinsurance to close transaction provides us with protection
against any further reserve volatility from the years of account 2017 and prior for Syndicate
1200. The transaction was priced approximately at our booked reserves, which is another
sign of comfort with our current reserve position. We are happy to put this behind us and
focus on better underwriting opportunities we have ahead.
As we have said before, our goal is to become a more focused and efficient organization.
Today, we are sharing our plans to take expense actions of $100 million against total
expenses incurred in 2019 of $724 million. We will be reinvesting some of these savings
into our ongoing businesses where we are generating better returns. We expect the
savings to result in an expense ratio of 36% by year-end 2022, which is a 250 basis point
reduction from 2019.
We provide additional detail on Pages 5 & 6 of our slides. We believe this is an achievable
near-term target that we will hit by focusing on a few key areas. First we have announced
several new executive hires and departures in recent months. The reorganized leadership
team will reduce the size and cost associated with Senior Management.

Bloomberg Transcript

Second, we are reviewing our real estate footprint and have reduced our marketing
budget. Since Sheltering in place began about 7.5 months ago almost all of our
employees have been working remotely. This is allowed us to re-evaluate travel,
entertainment and real estate needs for the future. Most of our leases are long-term, but
we expect to produce savings in this area.
Third we have and will continue to exit businesses that are not able to control costs or
meet our return hurdles. Several of these actions and transactions I mentioned a moment
ago fit into this category. Lastly being a more focused organization, we will reduce needs
for some external resources and we expect to reduce certain holding company and
investment expenses.
There has also been a drag on our results from other corporate expenses. In 2019 other
corporate expenses totaled $38 million. These costs are not included in our expense
ratio, but have a meaningful drag on our results. I'm pleased we incurred only $400,000
of other corporate expense during the third quarter of 2020, and we do not expect these
costs to impact our results in the future.
We believe these actions are a positive initial step to bring our expense base more in line
with our peers. While we're highly focused on reducing expenses, we will continue to
invest in our platform. Today, we are seeing opportunities to benefit from investments to
improve our processes and increase automation.
We provide several examples of this on Page 7 of the presentation. We are confident
these investments will continue to support long-term sustainable benefits to underwriting
results by being able to handle more business with the same amount of resources.
This year, we expect to spend about $10 million on our digital investments. We believe we
are getting good returns on those investments as they support some of our most

profitable and fastest-growing business units. A good measure of this is our U.S.
operations -- in our US operations is premium per employee.
In the last 10 years we've been able to double the amount of premium we write with
roughly the same headcount as seen on Page 8 of our presentation. Turning to market
conditions. We continue to see strong rate increases during the third quarter. On average
pricing was up more than 10% across the Group. The U.S. was up over 9% on average
while international was in the mid-teens.
We are encouraged by our ability to get rate and do not foresee slowdown in the
momentum. Additionally, we are seeing favorable changes in terms and conditions. While
the pandemic is certainly having an impact on the economy and growth in certain lines of
business for us, we remain very optimistic about the underwriting opportunities ahead of
us.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our financial results for the quarter were impacted by several natural catastrophe events,
mainly U.S. windstorms and wildfires as well as additional catastrophe losses from COVID19. The combination of these pushed us to an underwriting loss for the quarter. However
on an underlying basis there were some very positive signs in our results. Our current
accident ex-cat loss ratio improved 4.6 points from the prior year quarter. Better result
was primarily related to stronger rates and re-underwriting actions we have taken across
our book of business.
Similar to the first half of the year reserve development was modest in the quarter. Both
our U.S. and international operations experienced favorable development in the third
quarter. And on a year-to-date basis this was offset by strengthening in our runoff
segment primarily related to the legacy asbestos exposures.
We are very pleased with the stability of our reserves have shown this year. As we
mentioned in last quarter we had a third party review done at year-end 2019. Study
showed a central estimate that was in line with our booked reserves. We now have three
quarters in a row during 2020 with very modest net development. Overall,. we remain
comfortable with our current reserve position.
The expense ratio was up 60 basis points from the prior year quarter to 36.9%. However,
it was down nicely from both the first two quarters this year. Although, it won't continue in
a straight line we expect our expense ratio will move in the right direction to 36% by yearend 2022.
As you recall at the beginning of the year, we set our combined ratio target of 96% to
98%. On a year-to-date basis our combined ratio is 104.8%, above our original target.
However, if we apply a more normalized cat load to our results, we would be within our
guidance range for the first nine months of the year.
Page 4 of our presentation shows our year-to-date performance relative to our guidance
range in 2019. Looking through the impact of catastrophes and COVID, our underlying
performance for the first nine months of 2020 has been strong.

FINAL

In terms of growth our top line was up about 1% in the quarter. U. S. growth was 2.4%,
while international declined 1.4%. In the U.S. I would note all lines of business experienced
growth with the exception of liability. The primary driver of the decline in liability was our
workers' compensation business that has been impacted by payrolls. This included our
fronting business where we don't retain any of the risk and to a lesser extent at
Rockwood.
Despite this impact the U.S. still reported its strongest premium quarter in history. I would
also note that liability submissions were up more than 5% in the quarter. We're making
good progress on the underwriting side and anticipate continued benefits from the
strong market conditions across many areas of our business and the expense initiatives
we now have in place. We're extremely well positioned to our size with our capabilities
and talent to continue to build a leading specialty Insurance business.
I will now turn the call over to Jay to discuss our results in more detail.

Jay S. Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks, Kevin. I'll spend the next few minutes sharing some more detail on our results and
then we'll take your questions. For the third quarter of 2020 Argo reported a net
operating loss to common shareholders of $11.9 million or $0.34 per share an
improvement from last year's results of a $0.44 per share loss.
And while still a loss the current period was -- it was impacted by fundamentally different
factors than last year's results namely elevated catastrophe losses included losses -including losses stemming from COVID-19. The underlying current accident year margins
represented a significant improvement. And for the third quarter running prior year loss
activity was not material.
A further positive note we experienced a nice rebound in the marks on our private equity
and hedge fund portfolio that are reported through our net investment income. First on
the top line. Gross premiums written of $890 million were up approximately 1% from the
prior year quarter. Similar to last quarter growth was impacted by continued strong rate
improvement being partially offset by lower insured exposures as a result of economic
headwinds and the exit of business that Kevin alluded to in his comments.
In the third quarter, U.S. Gross premiums were up 2.4%, our growth was driven by a
continuation of positive rate trends and strategic growth initiatives in certain business
lines. The strongest growth was in professional liability and Inland Marine. Net written
premiums declined 3% in the quarter, primarily due to the impact of additional reinsurance
purchases relative to last year's quarter.
On the international side, our gross premiums year-over-year were down 1.4% in the third
quarter of 2020, this reflects a balance of right increases that continued in the mid teens
during the quarter offset by certain profitability initiatives including extreme business lines
in terminating binding Authority relationships.

FINAL

Overall, we feel good about the top line in the quarter. As Kevin noted, this was the
largest gross premium total in the history of our U.S. business. And international was down
only modestly and in line with our strategy to focus on profitability over growth.
Given the macro backdrop we think this is a pretty good result. Our combined ratio in the
quarter was 110.7% compared to 111.4% in the prior year period. The 2020 result included
16.5 points of catastrophe losses which were primarily due to U.S. hurricanes and wildfires.
The remainder was due to the continued impact of COVID-19.
Similar to the last quarter most of our catastrophe losses related to COVID-19 were the
result of event cancellation exposures within our contingency business. We believe we
have manageable exposure and expect future losses related to COVID-19 will be
meaningfully lower than we have reported on a quarterly basis during 2020.
As to the contingency business virtually all exposed events will have been determined by
the middle of 2021, and the impact from those events is modest in comparison to recent
quarters. The U.S. combined ratio was 102% in the quarter and included $26 million or 9.4
points of catastrophe losses. The international ratio was 116% and included approximately
$45 million or 30.9 of catastrophe and COVID-19 related losses in the quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

Reserve development in the quarter was unfavorable by $1.6 million. This reflects
favorable development in both our U.S. and international operations offset by asbestosrelated strengthening in our run-off segment. Overall, we're very pleased that for the
third quarter in a row, net reserve movement has been modest. And on a year-to-date
basis, both the U.S. and international are reporting favorable development.
On an underlying basis excluding catastrophes and prior year development our loss ratio
and combined ratio showed very positive year-over-year improvement. Our ex-cat
accident year loss ratio improved 4.6 points from the 2019 third quarter. And on a year-todate basis it is improved by 2.3 points. This demonstrates to us that our underwriting
actions over the last 18 months are beginning to bear fruit and depict up in the numbers.
In the U.S., we reported a one-point increase in the current accident year loss ratio
excluding catastrophes. The increase includes approximately 1.7 points from two large
claims while the prior year did not have any similar experience.
Overall, we're excited about what we're seeing in terms of underlying margin trends,
particularly with the pricing environment that appears to have strong momentum for some
time to come.
Our expense ratio in the quarter was 36.9% compared to 36.3% in the prior year quarter.
The current period was impacted by reinstatement premiums, which increased the ratio
by 0.3%. While we are still above our ultimate expense ratio goals as Kevin shared earlier,
we have a strategy to address our expense ratio and have established targets as he
outlined.

FINAL

In the U.S., the expense ratio was up a little over a point year-over-year. This primarily
reflected change in business mix and the impact of reinstatement premiums. On a yearto-date basis our U.S. expense ratio hasn't improved compared to 2019 and stands at
32.2%.
The international expense ratio showed some good progress in the quarter. We've
reported an expense ratio of 38.9%, which was flat with the prior year quarter. However,
the expense ratio was down nicely from the first two quarters of the year where it was
over 40%.
Turning to investments, our investment portfolio performed well in the quarter and
included a nice rebound in our alternative investments. Alternatives contributed $19.3
million to our investment income during the quarter, that's private equity and hedge fund
marks rebounded. This also included the receipt of a performance-based contingent
payment related to the 2017 sale of an investment that had been accounted for on an
equity basis and therefore, included in investment in the company historically. That gain
was just over $6 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our core portfolio continues to face pressure from lower yields and tight credit spreads.
Investment income excluding alternatives was down approximately 30% from the prior
year, quarter to $22.7 million. Part of this decline reflects de-risking decisions we made late
last year, but the general yield pressure in the market is unavoidable and we are not
currently looking to expand our risk appetite.
I would note that the foreign exchange loss was greater than we have experienced in
prior quarters and the result of an increased level of volatility in currency markets related
to the dollar, pound, sterling, euro and Canadian dollar. A portion of this loss is offset by
gains in our investment portfolio from assets held in non-U.S. dollar currencies.
Turning to capital, during the quarter, as expected we used part of the proceeds from the
preferred stock offering to repay the outstanding term loan of $125 million. Again I would
note that preferred provides capital credit while the term loan did not. Our book value per
common share was down slightly in the quarter, but was flat relative to June 30 when
adjusting for dividends.
I'd like to provide some thoughts around our announced transaction to sell our
reinsurance business Ariel Re. As we have discussed previously Ariel was largely
supported by third-party capital. In 2020 Argo's Capital commitment to support Ariel was
approximately 26% of the capital supporting the business against which we had
approximately $100 million deployed.
Under the agreed transaction we will keep the historical reserves and the remaining
exposures related to the 2020 year of account. And the buyer will provide the capital for
the business going forward. We expect that this will free up about half of our capital
commitment at closing with remaining have to be released over the next two years. I
would note that there are only about $80 million of reserves associated with this business
and that they relate mostly to short-tail lines.

Questions And Answers

FINAL

Operator
(Question And Answer)
At this time, we'll begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). And
first question comes from Greg Peters of Raymond James. Greg, please proceed.

Q - Greg Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone. Let's just first step back and talk about the business that you're
-- I think you called out $400 million of total gross written premium and $175 million in net
written premium that's going to be coming off of the books. Can you talk about, what the
combined ratio was on that business relative to the group average? Just trying to
understand from a modeling perspective. Is this going to be a lift or a drag on the loss
and expense ratios?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Yes, Greg. Good morning. The -- let's exclude the reinsurance business from that because
that was performing okay for us and in line. The reason that we sold the reinsurance
business was that the returns and the -- we were shifting capital to lower volatility as Jay
talked about a little bit that with our strategy today, we're not set up for the volatility, the
upside and the downside that comes with that business. So it wasn't necessarily about
performance in that business itself. So the other ones that you're talking about would be
Europe, the two European operations and Argo Insurance. And suffice is to say those had
been drivers of poor results. We have not talked about them in the past, but I -- splitting it
out like that I don't have the number off the top of my head but I can get it for you.

Q - Greg Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

I'm just directionally...

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

They certainly underperformed. And that's why we've been taking underwriting actions in
those businesses over the last several years, right? So to come under review, the
businesses are either not making the appropriate returns, or they don't fit the strategy or
we're not the right company for the strategy that you could get with an organization such
as Aerial. I think about it that way.

Q - Greg Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

Got it. Okay. I understand directionally where you're trying to head with this. And I know
you in your slide deck you focused on that slide 8, which is the employee count for gross
written premium. I look at that in the context of you dropping, next year $400 million of

Page 8 of 14



Company N ame: Argo Group I nternational H oldings L td
Company Ticker: ARGO US Equity
Date: 2020-11-03

gross written premium. Is that -- will we see that -- will we see that chart on slide 8 go
down now because of the reduction in gross written premium?

FINAL

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

That's a really good question, Greg. I want to point out this slide is for the U.S. operations
only. And it was the point it was really to highlight what the investments in digital and
systems have done over the past 10 years since the initiative started. They weren't all
digital until 2012 but in '11, some of the work started on the workflow side. And it's
important to note that through that period, there was also about $600 million of business
that was pushed out. So this is U.S. exclusive. And the whole point is to show that we have
put tools in place and we're moving to businesses that are efficient and profitable, but we
can continue to grow as we do that and we're setting ourselves up for really good growth
going forward.
The impact of the largest premium you're talking about is going to be felt in the
international business. And because of that, we're going to have not a linear drive
towards the 36% group expense ratio. There's going to be costs associated with the exit
of some of those businesses or re-underwriting that goes on. So that's why we said it's
over a two-year period that we are looking at. And we'll, each quarter track and let you
know where some of those moves come from. But there will be some times where
there's costs associated with exiting it that will appear in the business.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Greg Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

Got it. And then I guess the other area just to talk about, and I know you've provided color
around the expense ratio and reinstatement premiums causing some headwinds to
improvements there. But as an offset to that, most of the companies that we're dealing
with are reporting favorable -- favorable expense ranges like on travel and entertainment,
et cetera. And I guess to some degree we didn't see as much of that come through in
their consolidated numbers this quarter. When you go forward I mean do you -- are you is
it your intention not to incur travel entertainment and to keep it at these current levels as
we think '21 and '22? And I'm thinking about this in the context of your goal to get down to
the 36 expense ratio. Where's that going to come from essentially?

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Yes, yes. No, that is a great question, Greg. If you go to Page 6 and look at the four
segments, right? We actually talked about T&E in there. The best way to think about this is
that the bottom one other general expenses is going to be about one-third of the total.
The one above it, business rationalization is going to be a little bit less, but roughly onethird. And then the other two are going to be split with the remainder with more
weighting towards marketing and T&E and real estate. So there has been some savings
this year from where we were at '19. And those total around $55 million across the four
buckets. So costs are associated with that. So you're not going to -- like in bucket three,
there's a lot of costs associated, and there's some in bucket one. So you're not going to
see that necessarily in the expense ratio itself. Similarly where we've had reductions in
real estate travel and entertainment and marketing, those will continue longer than we
thought but they're going to -- they'll go back up at some point in time. Well, T&E will go
back up when the world and eventually starts trading face-to-face again. But I -- because
Page 9 of 14



FINAL

Company N ame: Argo Group I nternational H oldings L td
Company Ticker: ARGO US Equity
Date: 2020-11-03

we are reducing our footprint in terms of where we have people and the business we are
focused on, we expect there to be a reduction there. And we're not going to go -- we're
not going to operate the same way we did with the types of meetings that were
conducted and the amount of business travel. A lots of people have been able to figure
out how to use the technology to work well and get the business for us. It doesn't work in
every line of business, but it works in most of us quite well. So -- but we'll address those
each quarter and we can highlight when we're starting to travel again. And I think what we
want to be able to do is give you insight into what's in the buckets and a scorecard
update each quarter. So what's left unsaid there is this $45 million and that roughly
equates to 250 basis points that we talked about, that would get to the 36 by year-end
2022. And I keep emphasizing that because there maybe times when it ticks up and it
doesn't look linear, it may get frustrating.

Q - Greg Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

That makes sense. I guess the final question and I'll let others ask, would be strong capital
management. Your stock is trading below book value, you have a track record of
dividends and at times share repurchase. Where does Board stand with capital and capital
management and specifically share repurchase?

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. So I think, every meeting we look at the alternatives we have and one of them is
share repurchase and other would be dividends, obviously. And then the third one which
has been really what we've been pushing the money towards is business opportunity. And
as we continue to see good business opportunities, any excess capital we have we'll go
there first.

Q - Greg Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

Thank you for your answers.

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Thanks.

Operator
And our next question comes from Jeff Schmitt of William Blair. Jeff please proceed.

Q - Jeff Schmidt

{BIO 15098244 <GO>}

Good morning. The -- on your expense ratio Target of 36%, could you give us a sense on
what your targets are for each book. I mean, is a lot of that coming from the international?
I just want to get a sense on what the -- like what the U.S. target is?

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

No, that's a good question. The majority of it would have to come in terms of a
percentage basis on the expense ratio in each segment from the international, both

FINAL

because it's starting so high. But the growth that we're going to have in the U.S. business
is outpacing the business in the international area. So that means that they'll be more cost
borne by the U.S. business. So even though they're all U.S.-focused businesses, right? It's
just math. So we will be working on both sides, but I think you'll see more investment in
the U.S. and probably over time more on a percentage drop from the international side.

Q - Jeff Schmidt

{BIO 15098244 <GO>}

Okay. And then when we look at sort of corporate expenses, which you can kind of, I
guess, back into, if you take that total underwriting expense line and subtract out the
segments. Historically, that had been probably averaged $12 million a quarter $13 million,
$14 million even and that's been running at $8 million. Now I know there's incentive comp
in there which can vary, but it's been $8 million this quarter -- last quarter. Is that the right
run rate? Or is there some incentive comp lower there where maybe that's going to be
$10 million or $12 million going forward?

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Yes. So it's not an easy question to answer for you, I'm sorry. Because with some of the
departures that we're going to have, some of that may impact what was in the incentive
comp and that move as we go forward as well. But what I would say is that the -- our
expectation over time is that, as the business gets more focused there will be a reduction
there. Jay, do you want to add anything here?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jay S. Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

Yes. No. So It's a -- I think you got to the point I was going to get to Kevin. And I would say
that, currently kind of $10 million a quarter. Remember, this is the cost that we retain at the
corporate level. Think of it as the cost of running a public company and a public company
that trades in several international markets. As the platform simplifies, there's opportunity
to reduce that cost. So right now that's what I would think of it as but that's also
something where I think we plan to make progress.

Q - Jeff Schmidt

{BIO 15098244 <GO>}

Okay. And then in -- one more on the expense ratio, the 36% target. Does that assume
that the Ariel Re deal gets completed? I mean, I presume you still have regulatory
approvals and all that. I don't know if was Ariel Re was rerunning at a much higher or lower
expense ratio than that?

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

That is a very good question. The -- it does contemplate the sale of Ariel, right? We're
waiting regulatory approval. But the -- our intent and the buyer's intent is to move forward.
And the reinsurance business had -- has some -- on a direct basis was not as expensive as
the rest of the organization. However, there was a lot of resource consumption. So some
of that corporate expense would show up in that area. So -- but it's all contemplated.

Q - Jeff Schmidt

{BIO 15098244 <GO>}

Okay. Okay. Thanks for the answers.

(Operator Instructions). Our next question comes from Casey Alexander of Compass
Point. Casey, please proceed.

Q - Casey Alexander

{BIO 1521572 <GO>}

Yes, good morning. You called out the fact that you had added reinsurance purchases to
the net written of U.S. operations. Is it the company's feeling that looking at the
prevalence of CAT events and the changes in weather patterns that you may actually
further increase reinsurance purchases in the U.S. operations to again dampen the
volatility of earnings related to CAT events?

A - Jay S. Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning, Casey. We protect the exposure to CAT events across the group. So
that's done with what's looked at as the property exposure we have in the U.S. book
through the Bermuda operations and through the international operations. So I don't think
there'll be a change in how we look at that. But on the casualty side, we've had some
significant reductions in our limits exposed in not only the Bermuda casualty market, but -where it's down, 27%, but also in the U.S. casualty market our excess limits are down 15%
year-over-year. In ARGO pro, over a two-year period they're down 25% with an increase
of cumulative over that two-year time period 60% in rate. So we will be re-evaluating what
our reinsurance purchasing needs are and whether the programs fit the current limit
profiles because they've changed and that could lead to some savings for us in the U.S.

Q - Casey Alexander

{BIO 1521572 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. Secondly, I understand if I got this right. You have about $100 million of
capital deployed to the reinsurance and the transaction would free up about $50 million
immediately and the rest over a couple of years. But is there also a purchase price related
to the transaction?

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Yes. We haven't disclosed that. We'll wait til the close. So...

Q - Casey Alexander

{BIO 1521572 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

But when it's appropriate, we will come forward with the appropriate information.

Q - Casey Alexander

{BIO 1521572 <GO>}

Well, it costs me nothing to ask the question. So...

And our next question comes from Bob Farnam of Boenning and Scattergood. Bob,
please proceed.

Q - Bob Farnam

{BIO 15005467 <GO>}

Good morning. So you've made -- obviously you made a lot of changes in the international
business with the selling of Ariel Re and the reinsurance to close transaction at Syndicate
1200 and the changing -- exiting the continental Europe operations. The question is
probably for Kevin, what do you actually envision for international going forward? Is this
relative to the overall pie here, how much of this is going to be international? And what
types of this will be in that unit?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Yes. Bob that's a good question. I'm glad you asked it because it highlights what we've
talked about in this supplemental deck today where we talked about being a U.S.-focused
specialty insurer. And we -- there's -- we are focused on specialty insurance. It -- we write
a lot of it in the United States. It does make its way -- specialty insurance that's U.S.-based
makes its way into the Bermuda Market where we have a platform and into Lloyd's where
we have a platform. The reunderwriting that's gone on in Lloyd's and we didn't talk about
it, but there's been a number of stories throughout the quarter about some areas we've
gotten out of in Syndicate 1200 like the cyber area or we've gotten out of professional
liability that wasn't related to the U.S. So I think those type of things will help identify that
we're going to use those platforms. And as long as the businesses can perform at the
hurdles that we are setting, then they'll remain. If not we'll have to put them under review.

Q - Bob Farnam

{BIO 15005467 <GO>}

So as of right now since they're still around have they been performing to your hurdles?

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Well, I think when you talk about certainly recently Bermuda, yes, I think last year was
obviously challenged, right? When we had some reserve increases. So on an expense
side, Bermuda operation is very, very good. The challenge in the 1200 operation is the
expense side, but their loss ratios are good. So we've got to look at the total business
and what kind of return we are getting and the fact that there's predominantly U.S.

business that we're writing there and going forward, we'll just continue to watch it. And if
it works out, that's great. If it doesn't we'll look at alternatives.

Q - Bob Farnam

{BIO 15005467 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.
