Welcome to the presentation of TopDanmark Results for 2020. Proﬁt for 2020 was
DKK1.124 billion down from DKK1.547 billion in 2019, but better than between DKK750
million and DKK850 million, which was assumed for 2020 in the Q3 report. The
combined ratio was 86.5 compared with 83.7, mostly caused by lower run-oﬀ proﬁts and
by a higher claims trend on house insurance. Premiums increased by 3.6% in non-life, but
decreased by 1.1% in life. For 2021, the assumed combined ratio has been improved from
around 90 to between 89 and 90, excluding run-oﬀ. The proﬁt forecast for 2021 amounts
to between DKK1 billion and DKK1.1 billion, excluding run-oﬀ.

Bloomberg Transcript

As announced in the Q3 report, TopDanmark has upscale the eﬃciency program. The
eﬃciency program is expected to generate annual gross eﬃciency gains of around
DKK500 million in 2025.
Finally, the Board of Directors will recommend to the AGM a dividend of DKK1.8 billion,
which -- this corresponds to DKK20 per share.
These are the main points of my presentation.
Pre-tax earnings decreased by DKK534 million to DKK1.453 billion. The technical non-life
proﬁt decreased by DKK218 million to DKK1.316 billion. The decrease was primarily due to
lower run-oﬀ proﬁts and higher claims trend on house insurance. COVID-19-related issues
improved the technical result by DKK121 million.
The investment return decreased by DKK81 million to a loss of DKK15 million. The
investment return was impacted by the turmoil in the Danish mortgage market during Q1,
which resulted in a substantial spread widening that impacted the portfolio of Danish
mortgage bonds used for hedging the provisions.
Proﬁt in life insurance decreased by DKK210 million to DKK117 million, primarily due to a
lower investment return.
The claims trend deteriorated by 2.5 percentage point to a 70.1. The claims trend was
negatively impacted by lower run-oﬀ proﬁts of 2.5 percentage point, as well as a
deteriorated claims trend on house insurance of 1.9% percentage.

FINAL

Based on the negative claims trend on house insurance TopDanmark is taking actions by
with price -- risk-based price increases as well as increased focus on acceptance criteria
and claims prevention.
The underlying claims trend, which is the claims trend adjusted for run-oﬀ proﬁts,
weather-related claims, large scale claims, discounting and COVID-19 related claims was
71.0, a 0.1 percentage point improvement compared with 2019. COVID-19 impacted the
claims trend positively by 1.2% percentage points.
Premiums increased by 3.6% in non-life. The premium growth was split between 1.3%
increase in the private segment and a 6.2% increase in the SME segment.

Bloomberg Transcript

The good start to the distribution equivalent with Nordea continued into Q4, and number
of customer needs in the private segment was -- has reached 89,000, well above the
target for 2020. Accounting wise premium growth generated from the change of
distribution partner front Danske Bank to Nordea had a negative impact of 1.1 percentage
point in 2020. But in terms of portfolio of the switch distribution partner had a small
positive impact already 2020. Consequently, we still expect that the premium income in
2021 from the inﬂow of Nordea customers will fully compensate for the terminated
distribution agreement with Danske Bank. We continue to assume at premium growth of
just above 3% in 2021.
As stated, the combined ratio was 86.5 in 2020, up from 83.7 in 2019. For 2021, we have
improved the assumed combined ratio from around 90 to between 89 and 90, excluding
run-oﬀ. Since the announcement of the Q3 report, the discounting has decreased
representing a 0.5 percentage point deterioration of the combined ratio. On the other
hand, further eﬃciency gains have improved the assumed combined ratio by 0.5
percentage point. Furthermore, the outbreak of the new COVID-19 rotation has had the
positive impact on the 2021 assumptions of 0.3 percentage points. Finally, the actions
taken to improve the claims trend on house insurance have improved by further 0.2
percentage points. Consequently, the assumed combined ratio for 2021 has been
upgraded by 0.5 percentage point to between 89 and 90, excluding run-oﬀ.
Proﬁt in life insurance decreased by DKK210 million to DKK117 million. The lower return
was primarily due to a decrease in the investment return of DKK167 million, but also due
to the lower sales and admin result as well as a lower result on the insurance risk.
For 2021 the assumed proﬁt in life insurance is improved from between DKK50 million
and DKK100 million to between DKK100 million and DKK150 million due to the assumed
investment return being improved because of price increases and growth in the AUM.
Premiums in life -- in the life division decreased by 1.1% split between a 3% -- 3.6% growth
in regular premiums and 3.1% decrease in single premiums. In the second half of the year
premiums were negatively impacted by price increases on illness and accident insurance,
which is the interim product selling pension schemes to the corporate market. We assume
development in regular premiums in 2021 between minus 5 and several percent.

of Topdanmark's asset management company of DKK94 million. In Q4, the investment
return was DKK292 million, positively impacted by a good performance on equities.
As announced in Q3 report, Topdanmark has upscale investments in becoming more
eﬃcient. The eﬃciency program is expected to generate annual gross eﬃciency gains of
DKK500 million in 2025. The gross eﬃciency gains in 2021 are expected to amount to
DKK120 million. Compared with 2020, additional costs following the increased level of
investments in the eﬃciency program will impact costs for 2021 negatively by DKK100
million.

DKK30 million as assumed in the Q3 report to now positive DKK20 million in 2021.

earnings per share of DKK12.
