Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Storebrand's fourth quarter 2015
conference call. My name is Kjetil Ramberg Krokje, and I am the Head of Investor Relations at
Storebrand. Together with me I have Group's CEO, Odd Arild Grefstad; CFO, Lars Loddesol;
Finance Director, Sigbjorn Birkeland; and Head of Economic Capital, Trond Finn Eriksen.
In the presentation today, Odd Arild will give an overview of the developments in the quarter and
2015, and Lars will give some more detail on some elements in the results. The slides will be
similar to the analyst presentation released this morning and are available on our webpage. After
the presentation, the operator will open up for questions. To be able to ask questions you need to
dial into the conference call.
I'll now leave the word to Storebrand's CEO, Odd Arild Grefstad, who will start the presentation on
slide number two.

Thank you, Kjetil. Storebrand delivers a Group result before amortization and longevity reserve
strengthening of 275 million for the fourth quarter and 1,762 million for the full year. The result is
affected by significant special items during the quarter as we announced in a press release on
January the 28th. And Lars will come back on these in more detail later.



FINAL

The operation of Storebrand is showing strong underlying growth in fee and administration
income, which grew by 8.2 percent points adjusted for currency effects and discontinued business.
On the right-hand side you see some key figures from 2015 -- from 2015. We are experiencing
strong customer and premium growth in the insurance segments. Premium grew by 17% with
strong sales of individual P&C. We are also experiencing strong growth in non-guaranteed pension
and premium growth in 2015 was 25%.
In the fourth quarter, we decided to chart the result with the expected amount of the remaining
reserve strengthening for longevity. In total we have reserved almost 1.8 billion in 2015.
In two years, we have -- two years have now passed since we entered into the reserve
strengthening scheme with a need of 12.4 billion, of which now 83% is completed. The estimated
Solvency II margin for the fourth quarter is 168% with transitional rules, which is an increase from
the 146% in the third quarter. The estimated Solvency II margin without transitional rules is 124%. I
will get back to these features in more detail later on in the presentations.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let's then move to slide number three, adaption to Solvency II and reserve strengthening has
affected Storebrand in the past three years to five years. The transformation and adaption of our
business towards Solvency II has been strong and it has been a core focus for us to do this without
asking our shareholders on additional capital.
Storebrand has successfully entered Solvency II without raising new equity and now has the strong
solvency position of 168%, including transition rules and 124% excluding transition rules. As
previously mentioned, the expected equity charge for longevity is also finalized in this quarter. This
further shows that the Company is returning to a normalized situation and we expect also the
underlying Solvency II to increase ahead.
There is still of course challenges ahead, in particular relating to the management of the
guaranteed reserves in a low interest rate environment and we see strong market preparations,
especially in the first quarter of 2016 with falling shares, with falling interest rates, and also increase
in credit spreads. There is also remaining of 2 billion in longevity reservation to do going forward.
With these factors given, the Board of Directors have proposed no dividend for 2015, but plan to
pay a dividend for 2016. Let's then move to slide number four, just showing that the Storebrand is
in a fundamental transformation and that will still work, of course, with also handling our
guaranteed balance sheet going forward, while we also will make sure that we continue the strong
growth within savings and insurance.
Moving then to slide number five, longevity. We see that we have satisfied -- we are very satisfied
with having reserved a total of 10.2 billion of the 12.4 billion in the need for longevity. And this is
done now in two years out of the seven years we have to do this reservation strengthening. We
have also substantially built buffers to ensure that we will both meet our interest rate guarantee
going forward and also meet the remaining longevity reservation needed. By having charged the
reserve to be about 1.8 billion for longevity strengthening into 2015, we expect that the owner
share of the longevity strengthening is now completed.
Moving then to slide number six, we have divided the paid-up policy back book into four different
segments. And we have allocated held-to-maturity bonds in these different segments and three of
them actually have from 60% to 90% in asset allocation to what is held-to-maturity bond portfolio.
This is the main reason why we expect to have about or around 4% in return in this portfolio for the
next few years.
After 2020, the interest rate guarantee drops to 3% and we also have in 2015 this 16 billion of new
held-to-maturity bond portfolios with a yield above 3% and 13 years average life. And that is done,
of course, as you understand in a low interest rate environment. And this is in average of AA rated



bond portfolio. In total, this portfolio is now above 100 billion and will be in average on our books
for the next eight years.

FINAL

If we then move to slide number seven, the Solvency II position in Storebrand has been
strengthened by 22 percent points to 168% at the end of 2015. Excluding transition rules, the
solvency margin is 124% 20 percentage points strengthening from Q3.
The development in the solvency position from third to the fourth quarter is affected by several
factors. There is of course positive results, there is also this change in the interest rate curve in SPP
as Lars will revert to and there is also a change in the modeling of tax. There is also some factors
that has -- that have affected the solvency ratios negatively. For instance, one example is that, we
have changed the modeling horizon from 30 to 60 years. The most important change though is
that we have changed our accounting for tax effects, going into the Solvency II stress.
Storebrand has not previously accounted for this in our book. And including this tax stress, it leads
to our strengthening in the solvency position for the Group at approximately 17 percent points -percentage points.

Bloomberg Transcript

Another effect of improved modeling is that the sensitivity in the Solvency II numbers is reduced.
We are well aware that there is, of course, volatile market, functional markets in 2016 as I had
already mentioned. Stocks and interest rates have fallen and credit spreads has increased. This has
of course, as we see from the sensitivities, had effect on our Solvency II numbers in the first
quarter of 2016.
If we then move to slide number eight. As you know, we have working with cost for a long time and
we continue doing that in a very strong way going forward. We delivered a cost reduction of 400
million between 2012 and 2014. On our Capital Markets Day, we launched a cost-income target of
60% to balance the need for a high-cost discipline and growth in savings and insurance.
In 2015, Storebrand has increased costs due to an increased number of staffs within insurance and
savings, as well as costs related to restructuring. But adjusted for this restructuring cost, we have a
cost-income level of below 60%.
During the fourth quarter, the restructuring was implemented in the customer area in Norway and
Sweden. And that led to a workforce reduction of about 80 employees. We see that in relation to
the sale of Storebrand Baltic, the number of employees in Storebrand is dramatically reduced and
we also move from a fixed cost base and transformed into a variable cost base.
In 2016, we begin the process of transferring business processes of IT to our strategic partner
Cognizant. This will result in additional restructuring cost in 2016, however it turns into a situation
where it will be lower cost in 2017 and 2018. So we are now guiding on a lower cost base in 2018
compared to the nominal cost base in 2015, and this is the same as 300 million to 400 million in a
real cost reduction.
Moving into slide number nine. We see that the growth is coming through in savings and insurance.
I already talked about the growth within insurance and we see also strong growth here in unitlinked reserves of 22%, driven by growth in premiums of 25%, also 4.7 billion in conversion from
paid-up policies into investment choice. And this is done in a market that has been somewhat weak
when it comes to financial markets in 2015.
We also see strong growth of our asset management business of 7%. And it's also very
encouraging to see that the growth within our banking activities is now picking up, retail banking is
instrumental in the success in our private market strategy going forward.



FINAL

Then let's move to slide number 10, where we see that the growth in premiums in unit linked has
been strong in 2015. We met the level of more than 50% premium income within non-guaranteed
in 2014. This trend has continued very strong in 2015. And we are also very happy to see that a lot
of very important customers in Norway and Sweden has chosen Storebrand as their pension
provider during 2016.
The last slide from me is slide number 11, it shows very much the same picture as we have already
talked about. The switch from guaranteed business into non-guaranteed savings and insurance.
And the waterfall to the left is showing that the income reduction in guaranteed pension comes
from discontinued business in the public sector, but it's more than taken up by the growth of the
savings area where we have strong growths in 2015.
So by that, I give the words to Lars to take us through some of the numbers.

Lars Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Good afternoon, everyone. I will start on page 13, and I will only comment on two pages, but I will
spend some time on the first page, page 13, to help you understand the numbers.

Bloomberg Transcript

I suppose the 2014 and 2015 numbers were significantly impacted by one-off effects, I have in
these -- this first page 13 Storebrand Group adjusted -- tried to normalize the results above the
line and then explain the special effects under the line here.
So let's start with fee and administration income. It's -- and one more comment I will comment on
the full-year numbers as they -- as the quarterly numbers do -- are impacted by some periodic
effects, so the full year numbers for 2015 versus 2014. Fee and administration income as Odd
already said adjusted for currency and non-discontinued business is up 8.2%.
The risk result in the life and pensions business -- for life and pension is down significantly from '14
to '15. In '14, we could take into the income the risk adjustment fund, that was not possible in 2015
for regulatory reasons and instead the risk adjustment or risk utilization fund has been used to
strengthen longevity reserves.
The insurance premiums are up significantly from '14 to '15, up by 17%. But the claims are up
significantly as well. Netting these two effects, we see there is a strengthening result from these
two lines of 31 million. The operational cost is up by approximately NOK150 million. That is less than
the combination of normal inflation and strengthening Swedish kronor versus the Norwegian
kronor. So we have been able to keep a relatively good cost control, hiding the fact that we have
made significant investment in new customers and digitalization and we've been reallocating
resources in the Group.
The financial result is significantly down from 349 to 73. And that is a result of an lower return on
Company portfolios in Norway and Sweden, where we are impacted by the low interest rate
environment in both countries. In 2014, we benefited from falling interest rates in terms of
increased bond values and also a much higher interest rate level into the year. During 2015, we've
been hurt by a low interest rate environment throughout the year with Swedish rate stabilizing
below zero and Norwegian rates stabilizing at a low level. That gives a more normalized result
before profit sharing and loan losses falling from 2.6 billion to 2.2 billion from '14 to '15.
Then we have net profit sharing and loan losses and the result -- the fall in the result here comes
primarily from profit split in the Swedish operation where again there was a benefit during 2014 of
falling rates during bond price gains and also gains from the equity markets. This has not been the
case in 2015, and the results are significantly weaker. Of the 480 million in difference here, 460
million is due to lower profit split of the Swedish operation. That gives the result before



amortization write-downs and the special items falling from just short of 3 billion to a little more
than 2 billion.

FINAL

The special items are as follows. There is a -- we have strengthened disability reserves in the
Norwegian operation by a 100 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. In 2014, there was a release of
reserves, especially from the Swedish operation of 224 million weakening the overall risk result and
risk reserves by 324 million.
On the operational cost side, we have taken 97 million in a charge for laying off people and the
reorganization in 2015, whilst in 2014 we discontinued the defined benefit scheme we had for
employees in Norway. And that released pension liabilities of 571 million. Then we have a financial
result, minority share of result. We sold a large property in Norway, actually, in January, but the part
of the profit that went to a minority shareholder is for accounting purposes taken into our result
and then is taken out again as the minorities share of the results. We're deducting that here to -- or
adjusting for that as a special item. And then last, but not least, in the Swedish operation, we've
done two changes to our assumptions, we have taken the discount curve that we use for the
accounting purposes and made that the same as the one we use for solvency purposes. That has,
by using a lower interest rate curve to discount liabilities, the liabilities have increased in value. So
that gives a negative effect in the accounting result.

Bloomberg Transcript

We have also made changes to the cost allocation between traditional product and nonguaranteed products and between sales and maintenance of the product portfolio. That has a
positive effect.
The net effect of the two is 265 million loss in the fourth quarter. However, that should also be
seen in the context of improving results in the long-term going forward. And it's part of the
management actions that we do to, to make the Company well-prepared for Solvency II.
Then below the or the last line on this page is the provision for longevity. By taking 1,764 million in
charge for 2015, we basically take away all expected charge to shareholders of longevity
strengthening for the future. And we can now -- we don't -- we no longer have the 90 million or 90
million to 140 million that we've had in charges towards the shareholders result on a quarterly basis
for the last couple of years. This has now been neutralized by this one-off charge.
On page 14, very briefly, it's the same results put together, the special items and the normalized
items put together. In addition, we show here the result before tax, and the tax, which is a positive
contribution in the quarter and in for the full year 2015.
That is the result of a risk management within the property -- our real-estate portfolio that we have
where we've dissolved some holding companies as part of our risk management structure. These
holding companies had a tax loss, which then benefits the Company results with a tax carry loss
forward really giving a positive tax result for the quarter and for the year 2015.
And on the following page 15, that's broken into the three main business areas; savings, insurance,
and guaranteed pensions, where savings is developing very well adjusted for these one-off items,
insurance is relatively stable, while guaranteed pensions continues to be in run-off and with lower
results.
And that finalizes the introduction from our side and we are now opening up for questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator



Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And the first question come from Peter Eliot from Kepler
Cheuvreux. Please go ahead, your line is now open.

FINAL

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you very much. I have three questions, please actually. The first one was on the dividend,
where you said you plan to pay one for 2016. I guess I'm just trying to interpret a little bit how we
should think of the plan, I'm thinking if it's a really firm intention, then I'm just sort of wondering
why, I'm kind of struggling a little bit, a token dividend for 2015 wouldn't really have changed much
in the scheme of things in terms of the balance sheet, but I guess would have been taken very
well, so I'm just wondering whether that's sort of a hope for 2016 or a reasonably firm intention?
The second thing was on the paid-up book. I think that's grown sort of 12% versus the previous
year and in particular in Q4 seem to be quite high, the increase. I'd understood from previous
guidance that Q4 I could -- sorry, the Q1 or the start of the year could seasonally show quite lot of
growth, but thereafter it should be fairly muted.

Bloomberg Transcript

So I'm just wondering what we should expect there going forwards? And if there is anything you
can do to reduce that growth rate? And then finally, if I can fit in one more, you've shown some
very helpful sensitivities in terms of running yield in the next five years and you mentioned about
the eight-year average duration of the liabilities. But I'm just wondering, for the tail, is there any
sort of sensitivity you can give or have you done sort of work on what reinvestment rates you
would need over the long-term to keep being able to pay that and how that compares to current
new money rates? Sorry for the length of those, but thanks very much.

A - Lars Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Well, thank you. Let's start with the dividend discussion. It's very clear that we look upon our
Solvency II numbers in the end of 2015 as strong numbers. I am very satisfied with the
development of our Solvency II position during the year and now by the start of the regime in the
first quarter of 2016.
And of course, there is also, as you see from the sensitivity, it's quite a strong impact on falling
interest rates in combination with the falling shares and also credit spreads widening as we have
seen in the fourth quarter.
So and you should think about this as a situation where we now are entering into a position where
we are able to pay dividend that there has been two long periods that Storebrand has not been
paying a dividend. But when we start paying a dividend again, that is of course meant to be for
every following years going forward. And we like to be very sure that we are able to fulfill that
commitment. And you just look up on the guiding the Board here, as a very -- as a clear signal, they
have never said this before I think, when they came out with this kind of numbers, what they
guided on, they have a clear intension of paying a dividend for 2016.
Shall we then move to the next one?

A - Odd Arild Gref stad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Yeah, on reinvestment rates, I guess, Lars touched upon it on the new money rates (inaudible).
We've done 16 billion in the held-to-maturity portfolio now at above 3% level. And that is of course
with today's interest rates. And we view that as sufficient to cover the risk, the reinvestment risk in
the guaranteed portfolios as of today.
I think it's very important topic, of course, what we have done now is to invest to ensure our paidup policy portfolios in the period around 2025 to 2030. And we know that the interest rate
currency is then picking below, down below the 3% level. And we have been able to invest 16
billion in average of 3.1% in 2015.



That is still with average of the total portfolio of AA rated portfolio. And of course credit spreads is
also increased, so we see that we will have opportunities also to fill up in the paid-up in the heldto-maturity bond portfolio during 2016.

FINAL

A - Lars Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

And with respect to the paid-up policy growth. It's correct that it's strong growth in the fourth
quarter as a consequence of certain companies converting there in the fourth quarter. I don't have
a specific, I can't be a lot more specific than that. We have guided that, we think that there will be
approximately 8 billion in additional paid-up policies coming out of or coming in 2016. So you will
see continued growth in the paid-up policy book for the next few years.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks very much.

Operator
The next question is coming from Matti Ahokas from Danske Bank. Please go ahead, your line is
now open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Yes, good afternoon. It's Matti Ahokas here from Danske. Three questions please. I want to follow
up on Peter's, the dividend side, I'm just looking at your dividend policy and obviously also some of
your peers have said that the kind of payout ratio, IFRS-based payout ratio probably doesn't fit this
world especially taking into account, you haven't paid a dividend for many years, even though the
payout policy would have suggested one.
So the question is, basically, are you considering about changing the dividend policy for example,
at the Capital Market Day, in order for us to get a bit more kind of clarity on what are the key
drivers there, or is it just still the 35% of profits before amortization?
The second question is regarding DB Norway, the fee and admin income was up quite a lot
quarter-on-quarter, was it just that Q3 was unusually poor or why was it so strong? And then also
on the unit linked Norway, the operational cost was up I guess for the reserve increases, but could
you give us the figure for unit linked Norway please? Thanks.

A - Odd Arild Gref stad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Just to comment on the dividend again. I think you are absolutely right that the new regime now
entering into Solvency II clearly makes it very clear that we need to look into the dividend policy
and we will do that. And we will of course be much more clear on the capital position situations
then how to look at these issues when we come back to you on the Capital Markets Day.

A - Lars Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Yeah, on the DB margin, that was a little bit stronger in the fourth quarter, but overall a little bit
weaker for the full year. And it's little bit weaker for the full year since a lot of the public sector
contracts have moved out. And there are, of course, some cost base still left. So that's, I guess,
the main explanation.

A - Odd Arild Gref stad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

And in terms of growth, the defined benefit premiums are significantly low quarter-by-quarter
throughout the year.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}



But the income was up quite a lot, so is it the kind of, one should be looking at the full year
average as a normal run rate or --

A - Lars Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah, I think our average is a better proxy than looking at the movement from the third to the
fourth quarter, which is more of a periodization effects on the piece.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

And then unit linked, Norway operational cost was up, how much of this was related to reserve
increase and I guess it had to do with that --

A - Lars Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

We have stepped [ph] out -- or on the webpage Matti, there is an excel spreadsheet which divides
the restructuring costs down on the different -- the different sub-segments. So there it's disclosed
per sub-segment.

A - Odd Arild Gref stad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

In addition, there were increased sales bonuses in that area in the fourth quarter as a result of very
good sales during 2014. And also somewhat higher marketing spend.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Great. Very helpful. Thanks.

Operator
The next question comes from Jonny Urwin from UBS. Please go ahead, your line is now open.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Hi there, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I've got two. The first is, just the points
of clarification really. I mean I have respect to the IR department about the tax treatments
announced on January the 28th, just to do with the real estate portfolio being sold.
I guess I'm just struggling here a little to see how the DTA [ph] has arisen just given there's been
no economic loss as far as I am aware, and you sold down the assets but you transferred the
money up as dividends. And then it just seems like there is a loss on the tax accounting but no
economic gain. My somewhat basic understanding of tax legislation is that, normally that follows
substance rather than form wise, here it seems to be following the form. So if you could just talk a
bit about that, that would be very useful?
Secondly, around credit, clearly it's become a bigger issue for the sector this year and we still don't
have any sensitivities from Storebrand to credit spreads or defaults. So I was just wondering if you
could perhaps give us a steer on this and also comment that it would be, you know, be great to
get some of those sensitivities as soon as we can. So those are my two. Thanks very much.

A - Lars Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

Okay. If I start with the tax. You have a fair point. However, the way the, when we sold down in realestate a few years ago, in order to efficiently reinvest funds in bonds and equities, we were
allowed to take a dividend around some holding companies where you then booked a tax loss.
When this holding company has been dissolved since, then that is the tax consequence.



FINAL

I agree that this is strange, but there is an asymmetry in the way they handle tax for life companies
and non-life companies in the Norwegian legislation and this is a consequence of that asymmetry. I
agree that it's not necessarily logical, but it's a consequence of the tax legislation and it's -- this has
been fully transparent the whole way. And the dividends that were taken and the way they were
taken were approved by the authorities at the time they happened. So this is not any fixing of the
books or anything, it's a consequence of tax accounting, the way it works in Norway.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

And that's helpful. Thank you. And so the dividends have been approved by the authorities and has
the tax driven also subsequently been approved by the authorities or is it pending?

A - Lars Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

No, but it's fully transparent in the way we have reported to the tax authorities and we expect
them to look at this in the light of the big effects. But we also -- and we also have third party
opinion clarifying that this is the consequence of something we've done operationally. And
sometimes we get negative tax effect and in this case, we got no tax -- positive tax effect of
something that we've done operationally to improve the business.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Odd Arild Gref stad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

When it comes to your question regarding, sensitivities on credit, I can confirm that, that will be
presented on the Capital Markets Day.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Okay. And can you give us any sort of (inaudible) now?

A - Odd Arild Gref stad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

What I can say is that, that most of our portfolio in Norway is in a held-to-maturity bond portfolio
that really reduces the risk, the credit risk element into a Solvency II. So it's more on the mark-tomarket bonds that we are carrying in Sweden and also partly in Norway. But maybe Trond Finn if
you --

A - Trond Finn Eriksen

{BIO 17132188 <GO>}

I mean operational this is of course, it gives us the reinvestment opportunities. So if the higher
credit spreads doesn't reflect a higher default risk and then of course this is better reinvestment
opportunities in the market. When it comes to the solvency position, credit wide or spread
widening and will of course be negative on the solvency position. Although we're also worried is
seeing a lot of this risk is actually handled in the held-to-maturity bond portfolio. But we will come
back with the business activities on the Capital Markets Day.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Operator
(Operator Instructions) And we have another question from Matti from Danske Bank. Please go
head, your line is now open.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}



Yes. Thanks, just a follow up, could you give us some guidance on where would the full Solvency II
ratios stand as of today? I know you have given some of the sensitivities, but would be helpful if
you could point us to a figure. Thanks.

FINAL

A - Odd Arild Gref stad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Well, I think it's fair to say that this is quite complicated elements altogether, that needs to be
done. We do that of course on quarterly basis. We try to also get more monthly basis calculations.
And are doing that in a better way as we go along.
I think for this time being, it's more for us to look at the sensitivities, that we have provided. And of
course we have provided, the sensitivities in is the most important ones. And basically you can see
that, almost half of our stress test that we have shown in both the interest rates and when it
comes to shares has actually occurred during the first quarter.
So, that means that you of course can look at the impact of that, and that will, I think be close to
10% points in self and on top of that, we will also see in some impact from credit spreads and also
a combination of this is something different than just a single stress in itself. But I think that is the
most I can say about these sensitivities by now as such.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Right. Thanks, Odd.

The next question is coming from Jonny Urwin from UBS. Please go ahead, line is now open.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Just a very quick follow up, thank you. I was wondering if you could tell us anything about the stakes
of the SCR ex-transitional, year-end just how much was, that will be really helpful. We had some
disclosure around the -- from memory it was Q3 2014, but we haven't had much since then, so if
you could give us a stay [ph] that will be great.

A - Lars Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

The SCR as of Q4 was 28 billion.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Sorry, could you repeat?

A - Lars Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

28 billion.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

28. Thank you very much.

Thanks very much everyone. Just one question actually, just looking at your dividend guidance
around the 45% payout ratio essentially under normal conditions. I just really wondered, now that
we have the shareholders contribution to the longevity buffer building complete, what is to prevent
this from being taken as normal conditions now with the market volatility that you've had recently I
mean you would consider this to be still abnormal conditions? Thanks.

A - Odd Arild Gref stad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Well, as we said, we will guide more on this when we come back to you at the Capital Markets Day.
I think it's a fair statement that we now have finished shareholders portion of longevity reservation.
Although it is still 2.2 billion left before we have finalized the total longevity reservation means that
we need to ensure that we take the surplus the customer's return, already next years to also fill
the remaining 17% of this longevity reservation.

Q - Andy Sinclair

{BIO 17749036 <GO>}

Sorry, just following on from that. About how long do you except it to take for that 2 billion to be
built?

Well, that is very much, I think you see that there is strong buffers, that is possible to utilize to do
this. So, it can done, quite soon. But then again, we have a five years horizon on it. And of course
some contracts have a high guarantee and also low part still, that is been fulfilled with longevity.
So I think that, if you ask from us straight risk management point of view, we should use some time
to finalize this. And I am sure that we have the buffers available both for low interest rate levels in
itself for the interest rate gravity and for the longevity reservation. But it is very clear that if we
need and if we like to do, we can fulfill this reservation under remaining 2.2 billion much faster than
this remaining five years.

And the next question comes from (inaudible) from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, your line is
now open.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Hi, thank you for taking my question. I have a really quick one. As a follow-up to the question posed
by the gentlemen from UBS regarding the SCR figures. And I was wondering, so of that 28 billion
that you disclosed for Q4, can you provide a breakdown or are you in a position to provide the
disclosure as to how that breaks down into various risk sub-modules in terms of life, non-life,
etcetera? And this is -- if you cannot today, at least this is something that we could expect going
forward? Thank you.

A - Lars Loddesol

{BIO 3969188 <GO>}

I think that's a good question. And I think it's something that we will prepare for the Capital Markets
Day, and present.

A - Odd Arild Gref stad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

And I also like to add that, if you look at the Capital Markets Day for 2014, there is a -- the SCR is
broken down by risk type and it's probably a good rough guidance for what it is now as well.



Q - Unidentified Participant
