{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Well, thanks, Ken. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. As society
continues to navigate the shift from a pandemic to an endemic disease and impact we
remain focused on being there for customers in both good and bad times, protecting our
employees in an evolving work environment and helping to build a resilient society that
can grow and prosper.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our ability to do all of this is largely due to the momentum in our business and the
resilient and strong performance we continue to deliver. This last quarter was no
exception. Yesterday evening we announced step -- third quarter net operating income
per share of $2.87, a 3% increase over Q3 last year, driven by strong underwriting and
distribution results with upper single digit accretion from the RSA acquisition.
With our operations performing really well, a strong balance sheet and favorable outlook
for capital generation. we're pleased to increase our quarterly dividend by 10% to $0.91
continuing our 16-year track record of annual increases. Top line growth of 68% was
obviously driven by the acquisition of RSA, but with approximately 7 points of organic
growth reﬂecting strength in commercial lines across all geographies.
The overall combined ratio was solid at 91.3, despite including 7.5 points of cat losses,
double the expected level. Following several severe weather events in the quarter, our
teams move quickly to get our customers back on track.
Now let's look at our results by line of business, starting with Canada. So in personal auto,
premiums grew 27% year-over-year with 1% organic growth. The combined ratio was
again strong at 85.1%. Our personal auto business is solid and it's well positioned to
operate at the lower end of mid-'90s as we integrate RSA.
Looking at the industry, we expect muted premium growth in the near term, until driving
patterns returned to pre-pandemic norms. In personal prop, premiums grew 34%, organic
growth was healthy at 5%, driven by ﬁrm market conditions, which we expect to continue
given the challenges that weather and climate change present. The combined ratio of
93.5% is right in line with our view that this segment should operate sub-95 even with
severe weather.

FINAL

In commercial lines premiums grew 33% in the quarter, including 8 points of organic
growth. The 91.2% combined ratio was strong reﬂecting our proﬁtability actions over time.
Looking at the industry, we see hard market conditions continuing. Our Canadian
commercial lines business is well positioned to deliver low '90s or better performance
going forward.
Moving to our UK&I business, the ﬁrst full quarter added $1.3 billion of premiums to our
platform,in line with our expectations. The combined ratio of 93.9% was solid and
included 10.3 points of cat losses, approximately 6 points above expectations. Personal
lines with a 97.9% combined ratio is clearly an area of focus for the team we already have
action plans in place. In commercial lines, the 90.5% combined ratio was strong. Overall.
the UK&I business is in a good position and we're focused on building sustainable
outperformance,
Looking at the industry, we see softness in personal lines in the UK ahead of reforms next
year. While the commercial lines environment it hard. In our US commercial business,
premiums grew a very strong 21% in the quarter with hard market conditions and solid
new business contributing. The

Bloomberg Transcript

Combined ratio at 92.8% was solid despite including 4 points of cats [ph]. This business is
very good momentum and the US team is executing on its objective to deliver sustainable
low '90s performance.
Turning to our RSA acquisition, which we closed in June. The integration and transition
are on track across the board. In Canada, nearly all of our RSA colleagues have been onboarded into our HR platform. There's strong traction and engagement with the brokers
and aﬃnity partners, which further solidiﬁes our outlook on volume retention. Policy
conversions in Canada are well underway and we're on track to begin to shutdown
systems in 2023 We're also integrating our claims operations and leveraging our supply
chain capabilities to deliver a strong customer experience, while realizing synergies.
In the UK&I segment, it's all about building outperformance. There are three near term
areas we're focused on. First, for personal lines, we've already launched initiatives to
increase pricing sophistication and to be ready to compete as pricing reforms come into
eﬀect in 2022.
Second, in commercial lines, i's about growing in the segments where RSA has already a
sound and high performing oﬀer. It's about building on our strength. Great example is the
mid-market in the UK. At the same time, we're tightening our focus in areas where the
economics are not stacked in our favor.
And the third area, we're looking at in the UK is to simplify the business operating model
and the technology platform to increase agility and help deliver on our outperformance
On global specialty lines, there's been strong collaboration and engagement across
regions, in tax [ph] on boarding into RSA's global network as commenced, which brings
in-house the ability to support global customers.

FINAL

Finally, we're spending considerable time assessing the potential capabilities for global
franchises and have identiﬁed a fortunate these to leverage our expanded scale and
expertise to drive meaningful outperformance.
Alongside the RSA integration, our teams continued to advance our strategic roadmap,
distribution earnings have become a signiﬁcant contributor to our outperformance and
growth with EBITDA compounding at over 20% over the last ﬁve years. We expect the
momentum to continue in 2022 and as we continue to build scale in Canada.
In August, BrokerLink acquired Archway insurance and South Coast insurance, doubling
our size in Atlantic Canada and becoming one of the leading East Coast brokers. In our
direct business, Biller Direct [ph]-has evolved or oﬀered to create a simpliﬁed insurance
experience for customers by reducing the number of products, forms and rules by over
50% in the last 2 years. Our coverage is now easier to understand and coupled with the
improvements to our apps to drive digital engagement, yields a better customer
experience and that's driven our industry-leading direct distribution expense ratio to
below 20%.
The signiﬁcant cat experienced in this quarter act as a reminder that our customers are
facing the devastating impacts of climate change right now. Globally, the last decade was
hotter than any period in the past 125,000 years and Canada's heating at twice the global
average. Society's collective eﬀorts to transition to net zero carbon emissions are critically
important. At the same time, we must double down on adapting to the current extreme
weather impacts of climate change. And this requires an approach that includes
government, NGOs, businesses and individuals. And in fact, we've invested in community
eﬀorts to help get critical projects oﬀ the ground including through our signiﬁcant
investments in the Intact Center on Climate Adaptation.
Our investment team recently joined Climate Engagement Canada, an initiative that
drives dialogue between the ﬁnancial community and corporate issuers on climate
change risks and opportunities. And we're taking important steps to transition our own
business at zero. These clear actions will ensure that we can help society better protect
our customers and win in the marketplace.
In support of this, I've just wrapped up a few days at COP26, the United Nations Climate
Change Conference in Scotland, as a member of the Canadian delegation. And it's our
goal to help build a clear roadmap to future-proof society..
In conclusion, momentum across the business is very strong. and the RSA acquisition has
signiﬁcantly advanced our strategic roadmap on all fronts. Our ability to deliver strong
results react quickly when weather events happen and made strong progress on the RSA
integration and our broader strategic agenda would not be possible without our people.
And I want to thank them for their continued engagement and coloration.
As we set our sights on 2022 and beyond, we have a clear focus on what we want to
achieve, and that is to provide second to non-customer experience with an engaged
workforce and to continue to deliver on our ﬁnancial objectives to grow net operating

income per share 10% annually over time and to outperform the industry ROE by 500
basis points every single year.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Louis Marcotte.

FINAL

Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Thanks, Charles, and good morning, everyone. We delivered solid results again this
quarter, despite heavy cat losses, well above our expectations for the third quarter. I'm
very pleased with the performance of all of our operations, delivering a 91.3 combined
ratio and net operating income per share of $2.87. These results include RSA's Canadian
and UK&I operations. And as expected, the acquisition was immediately accretive,
contributing 8% to our Q3 net operating income per share.

Bloomberg Transcript

Underwriting income grew 15% to $426 million compared to a very strong Q3 last year, as
robust performances across all segments continued to reﬂect the beneﬁts of our actions
over time. As expected, prior year development was healthy at 2.6% of opening reserves.
We continue to expect favorable PYD in the 1% to 3% range in the long term, but at the
upper end of this range in the short term.
Net investment income of $191 million increased by 34% year-over-year, driven by the
addition of RSA's investment portfolio. We expect a similar level of net investment income
in Q4. Distribution EBITDA and other income continued to outperform our expectations,
growing an impressive 30% in the quarter, driven by higher variable commissions as well
as solid organic and M&A growth. Keep in mind, that these earnings are partly oﬀsetting
the elevated variable commissions in our Canadian expense ratio.
Looking ahead, we expect growth for the fourth quarter to be in the mid-teens following a
strong Q4 last year. For 2022, we expect EBITDA to surpass the $400 million mark on the
back of continued momentum in the business. Looking at underwriting results in a little
more detail. First, the Canadian segment. In personal auto, the underlying loss ratio of
62.5% remained strong slightly increasing in the quarter to reﬂect an uptick in driving
activity.
Our telematics data suggests that kilometers driven are nearing pre-pandemic levels, but
claim frequency remains below historical averages. Favorable prior year development was
healthy at 4.7%, reﬂecting reduced uncertainty around claims patterns during the
pandemic.
In personal property, the 93.5% combined ratio reﬂected 17 points of cats, which is 10
points higher than expected. This was oﬀset by a weather-driven 4.4-point improvement
in the underlying loss ratio and higher favorable prior year development.
Looking at Commercial Lines, high single-digit organic growth is driven by rate
momentum in what continues to be hard market conditions. The underlying loss ratio of
50.6% was very strong as the beneﬁts of our proﬁtability actions continue. The overall
expense ratio in Canada increased 2.2 points to 32% largely driven by a high level of

FINAL

variable commissions following continued strong underwriting performance. The addition
of RSA had a positive impact on the expense ratio, thanks to a higher proportion of direct
business and the beneﬁt of synergies.
Overall, our Canadian business performed very well despite heavy cat losses. The
addition of RSA's Canadian segment had a slightly positive impact on the combined ratio
in the quarter. We saw solid performances in personal lines, while commercial lines saw a
fair bit of non-weather-related cat losses.
In the US, our business is doing very well both from a top and bottom line perspective.
Rate momentum continues to be strong and favorable market conditions. Our 93%
combined ratio after 9 months is aligned with our low 90s expectations after considering
excess cat losses.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to the UK&I, I'm pleased with the ﬁrst full quarter of results. If we normalize the
reported combined ratio for excess cats, we are ahead of expectations, thanks to benign
non-cat weather and fewer large losses. It remains early innings and although it has only
been one quarter, we like what we see thus far. We expect this business to run sub-95 in
the near to midterm.
IFT's earnings per share for the quarter was down close to 30% due to RSA-related
integration costs, as well as the partial sale of shares and impairment losses related to a
venture investment that IPO-ed in Q1 of this year. After considering the $273 million gain
recorded in Q1 and realized losses and impairments this quarter, we are left with a net
gain of $69 million on this investment. Our remaining position in the stock today is
minimal.
As we near the one-year anniversary of the announcement of the RSA acquisition, our
view of the ﬁnancial merits of the transaction remains very compelling. We delivered high
single-digit accretion after four months against a strong stand-alone performance of IFC.
We delivered $24 million in earned synergies year-to-date and are tracking towards an
$85 million run rate by the end of 2021. I'm conﬁdent we can beat our $250 million target
within 36 months, and this is without reﬂecting any risk selection improvements to the loss
ratio.
And ﬁnally, we've agreed to an exit of the Danish business on favorable terms. When
considering all of these elements, we see the IRR of the RSA transaction tracking near
20% above our initial calculation.
Moving to our balance sheet. It's been a busy quarter. Our teams have been working hard
to combine our asset portfolios, migrate the asset allocation towards our optimal mix and
at the same time, capture opportunities in the market. We have also been successful at
reﬁnancing of some of the UK capital instruments into Canadian debt instruments with
positive impact on our ﬁnancing costs and capital structure. Finally, we have derisked our
Canadian pension plans by purchasing annuities representing approximately a quarter of
the total Canadian pension obligations.

Our ﬁnancial position continues to be strong. We closed the quarter with approximately
$2.7 billion in total capital margin, a healthy buﬀer to absorb potential shocks, reﬂecting
strong regulated capital ratios in all the jurisdictions. Our debt to total capital ratio was
just below 24% at the end of the quarter. Most of the proceeds from the sale of Codan
Denmark will be used for deleveraging. The remainder will be used for growth
opportunities or buybacks as for our well-established capital management framework. We
expect to reach our debt to total capital ratio target of 20%, well ahead of the initial
objective of 36 months.
The strength of our results over the past year has led to an operating ROE of 18.3%. With
the acquisition of RSA and the progressive return to normalcy, we expect our operating
ROE to migrate towards a mid-teens level. Given the pace of earnings growth, further
bolstered by RSA's earnings and synergies and the strength of our balance sheet, we
have increased our dividends by 10% this quarter, and we expect to resume our usual
dividend increase announcement at the Q4 earnings release in February 2022. As society
cautiously moves towards a post-pandemic new normal, our priority remains delivering
on our strategic roadmap. With the RSA integration well on track and strong earnings
momentum supported by favorable market conditions, we are well positioned to emerge
from this pandemic with continued strength and outperformance.
Together with RSA, we have a highly resilient platform with signiﬁcant growth potential,
and I am conﬁdent in our ability to continue to create value for our shareholders.

With that, I'll give it back to Ken.

Thank you. Good morning. So I want to ask, ﬁrst oﬀ, maybe you can dissect a little bit
more the trends for personal auto, just in terms of frequency and severity? And I guess
there's some particular concerns around severity trends for the industry. So maybe you
can address that and how you're thinking about that going forward?

frequency, but I think more importantly, maybe, Patrick can give us perspective on what

Sure. So in terms of driving and frequency, driving space close to about 5% below
historical average for a few weeks now. but we still see ﬂuctuations week-over-week in
one region versus the other. Frequency is also still below pre-pandemic level, but it has
been at it is size [pj] since the start of the pandemic entering into September. So we're
following a lot of mobility indicators, both internally and externally and all those indicators
are showing consistently higher driving in 2021 versus 2020.
What we see also is that return to the oﬃce weekdays congestion, especially the morning
rush hour and public transit indicators are steadily increasing since the end of the
summer, but we see it's taking a bit longer than anticipated to return to the pre-pandemic
levels. And we believe that's what is explaining and part why frequency is still below
historical levels, even if the driving is pretty close.
As people continue to return to the oﬃce in the coming months, we expect the driving
activity to continue to rise, and we'll be following that very proactively to add up our
strategy. So that's what we think the...

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Thank you. Yeah. Thanks, Isabelle. So Patrick, I mean, we've been observing inﬂation and
personal automobile for some time why don't you share with us what you're seeing now
and what was there before, maybe?

FINAL

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Great. Yeah. So on the severity side, it's important to take into account, as you point out,
shall some mitigating actions that we've been taking, as well as some oﬀsetting factors
that we currently observe in the supply chain. So in severity, ﬁrst of all, it's important to
mention that on the injury side, we see no severity increase there. And this is reﬂective of
our prudent approach in reserving since the start of the pandemic.
On the short-tail line, so the physical damage, we do see a 5% increase in severity when
we compare Q3 this year versus same period last year, and it's driven by two main factors.
The ﬁrst one Isabelle talked about driving habits that create less concentration of driving
in the rush hours, especially in the morning that creates proportionately more severe
accidents. So we -- there's less of the small bumper claims in the mix, and that in itself is
driving about 3 points of that overall 5% increase in severity.

Bloomberg Transcript

The remaining 2% continues to be driven by the technology in cars. So when we say that,
we mean that the parts are costing are higher, but also the complexity of the repair
process that creates more costs. We've identiﬁed that at least 3 years ago and have
started to implement mitigating factors in the way we handle the claims as well as in
pricing.
There's a lot of indicators on the price of new and used cars, and we see as well here in
Canada, double-digit inﬂation on market values on these cars and even higher ﬁgures in
the 20s for some makes and models. But this is where we have some important oﬀsetting
factors. This has very limited impact currently on our severity -- the severity of our claims
because when a car is declared total loss, which is when we have to replace the car by a
new one or a used car, we sell the damaged car for the parts. and we've seen signiﬁcant
increases there in the recoveries.
So net-net, on the total loss when I look at Q3, the total loss severity is actually slightly
down in Q3 this year versus last year. So we're reﬂecting these trends in our actions. We
continue to leverage the tools that we have to mitigate some of it. And this is why when
we look forward, we say this business is well positioned to operate in the lower part of the
mid-90s on a go-forward basis.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Thank you.

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Want to provide additional color on this front? Well, I would say the variable commissions
are up. But keep in mind, they're sharing some of the beneﬁts we have from the better
Page 9 of 25

FINAL

combined ratios, and then we get some of it back to distribution. So the net eﬀect of the
higher CPCs is largely oﬀset by the distribution income. And then it leaves a net beneﬁt of
just a better performance net to us, and that's positive to the ROE. It's clear.
We have not necessarily tried to match the exact ROE beneﬁt with that dynamic. But given
the strong combined ratios we've delivered despite higher CPCs that's positive, and then
we capture the distribution income in our ROE calculation. So I think net-net it's positive.
It's just -- I wouldn't be able to take a number speciﬁcally to the pandemic portion of it.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Okay. Just my second question is, just as we're starting to see more growth in terms of
sales of electric vehicles, what sort of work or what have you done to give yourself comfort
around appropriately pricing auto insurance policies for EVs to avoid negative surprises
down the road?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. It's interesting, Geoﬀ. So ﬁrst of all, it's not a big portion of the car pool. I'll just say
that. And second, there's a very diﬀerent proﬁle in terms of claims both frequency and
severity within the electric vehicle category, where the diﬀerence for cheaper electric
vehicle is quite not the diﬀerence, but the patterns are very diﬀerent for the more
expensive electric vehicles. So it's hard to generalize. I'll ask Isabelle to share her
perspective on that because she's pricing for these diﬀerences.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Isabelle Girard

{BIO 17342111 <GO>}

Yeah. So we've talked about in the past, our pricing segmentation that is quite precise
with machine learning, but also with the data we have internally. So despite the electric
vehicles being a small proportion of the pool of vehicle, we're working with our claims
colleagues to look at the data we have, and we price each make, model and year
individually, and that include the electric vehicles as well.
So we're able to be very segmented in our pricing to reﬂect diﬀerent types of costs we
may have for those vehicles, and that's what we've been doing in the past and continuing
to do the more we get information and data on those vehicles.

over the next year or so? And how does that diﬀer for your US business versus your
Canadian commercial lines casualty business?

FINAL

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you. Again, another pattern we've been on for a number of years. And I'll ask
Darren to share his perspective on that? And then maybe, Patrick, you can chime in if
there's anything to add.

A - Darren Godfrey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks, Mike. I mean you're right relative to one. This is one that we've been
watching for quite some time around social inﬂation, both in Canada and in the US. The
social inﬂation is not a new topic for us. It's not incrementally increasing. That's not our
observation at this point in time. It clearly is more relevant, though, for our US operations
than our Canadian operations, where our book in the US is more heavily skewed towards
casualty type exposure. So it's very much relevant to the US So we're watching very
carefully.

Bloomberg Transcript

I mean it exists. It's in place, but nothing of material concern. And in fact, if I look at sort of
our loss trends that we have in place at the moment in the US relative to the rate that is
ﬂowing through the book, we have a meaningful gap at the moment between our loss
trends and our rates that are ﬂowing. So we're quite comfortable from that standpoint.
From a Canadian standpoint, obviously, we've been watching this one quite some time.
It's obviously been very, very relevant on the personal auto side that we've been ﬁghting,
obviously, in terms of longer tail coverage for some time. Obviously, on the commercial
side, it's more property inﬂuenced compared to the US. But nonetheless, we're still
watching very, very closely social inﬂation. But similar to the US, nothing material, no real
sort of net change in the environment of late. But again, there, we're also still continuing
to push quite strong rates as well.
And then, obviously, lastly, on the UK as well, too, very, very, very similar from a Canadian
standpoint, strong rates, watching both property inﬂation, social inﬂation, but good
margin versus loss trends at the moment.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I think on the US, the point -- there's a few points that need to be made. So ﬁrst of all, the
duration of the liabilities in our US book is actually very short. It's less than in the Canadian
book. It's a little more than 2 years. That's the ﬁrst point. The second point that I would
make is when we bought the US business, we've shut down three lines of business in the
months following closing. The lines of business that we've shut down are the lines of
business that have been most impacted by casualty inﬂation in the US. We saw that. We
had, I think, a reasonable read on older accidents years development and felt that we
couldn't compete in a number of sectors, whether it's health care, whether it's architect
and engineers programs and so on, and we exited these lines.

I would say where -- our footprint in the US now actually looks really good, short tail. And
we have a few lines of business where we're going through a curtailing of the portfolio
lines that are under proﬁtability improvement and they would be lines that have been
more exposed to casualty inﬂation, but we've been working on these lines for three years.
So these would be lines we have not exited, stayed in, we feel we have a good shot at
winning, but we're working hard on the inﬂation there. Patrick, do you want to share your
perspective from a claims perspective.

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Yeah, very much aligned with what was already shared. Maybe the only additional point I
would make is we have a competitive advantage in the way we handle casualty claims. We
have a team that will reach with the internalization of RSA, about 600 lawyers and law
professionals that handles more than 80% of these claims internally in Canada, and we've
started two years ago to internalize a portion of the US as well. So I think that helps us
manage these trends, but also understand very well the driving forces and where it's
happening.

Thanks, Patrick. or are you, Paul?

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

It's very helpful. So I mean partly given that answer, what I want to ask is a bigger picture
question. So Louis just said that your expectation is for the ROE to migrate back down into
the mid-teens, which has been your long-standing target. I would ask today, given
increased scale advantages, the investments you've highlighted that you've made in the
business over time to increase your competitive moat. And then just more favorable
earnings mix, I would argue over time. Like why isn't that ROE objective pushing to
something a little bit higher?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. Paul, the objective is to outperform the industry's ROE by at least 500 basis points
every year. We've built out clearly our leadership position in Canada. And the strengths
we've invested in, namely pricing, risk selection, claims, supply chain management over
the past couple of decades are driving the outperformance.
Keep in mind, we're building a business in the US, and I think the US team has done a
great job to create outperformance over a 4-year horizon, and I'm very pleased with the
trajectory there.
But I think in the UK, we need to build outperformance. And as such, when I think about
the objective, there's a lot of momentum in the organization. No doubt about it. We've

Page 12 of 25

invested in our strengths, the sandbox in which we're operating is bigger, and we need to
create outperformance across the platform, and that's what we're focused on.

FINAL

Louis, I don't know if you want to provide additional color here, but not going to guide
towards, yeah, a point estimate. But Louis?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Yeah. Maybe I think if you listen to the guidance in terms of long-term expectations for the
combined ratios as we get back to normalcy that tends to migrate towards the mid-teens
ROE. So that's consistent. I think we're trying to guide everyone here into the guiding or
the gliding of our ROE towards that mid-teens level compared to where it is today. And
the other dimension we need to keep in mind is the NOIPS growth objective as well. So
we got to balance EBITDA too here. And I think the mid-teens target that we're aiming for
is consistent with the NOIPS growth target that we're trying to achieve as well.

Your next question comes from Geoﬀ Kwan of RBC. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Geoﬀ Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. You've had this dynamic now where the pandemic helps the claims
ratio and that in turn has increased your expense ratio from the higher variable
commission, which has also resulted in higher distribution income. And so my question is,
is relative to the pre-pandemic levels, like what has been the net impact on the ROE from
these diﬀerent variables?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Thanks, Geoﬀ. Well, ﬁrst of all, the expense ratio is up you know, not down because of
variable commission. That's the ﬁrst point I would make. I think that as you think through
what we've done in the pandemic, and you go back to March 2020 when the pandemic
started. We put in place right at that moment, a relief program that was risk-based and
needs-based and provided our customers close to $650 million of relief eﬀort. A big
portion of that has been earned already.
And beyond some of the relief provided rate adjustments where appropriate, again,
based on a risk and on a need basis. It's also important, Geoﬀ, to keep in mind that we've
put up in commercial lines north of $100 million of reserves for pandemic. So in balance at
this stage, if you take a long-term perspective, the net beneﬁt is -- there's no real major
net beneﬁt here, give the relief we've provided given the impact that the commercial lines
cost of COVID has been and some of the rate adjustments that have been put in place.
Louis, I don't know if you want to provide additional color on this front?

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

FINAL

Well, I would say the variable commissions are up. But keep in mind, they're sharing some
of the beneﬁts we have from the better combined ratios, and then we get some of it back
to distribution. So the net eﬀect of the higher CPCs is largely oﬀset by the distribution
income. And then it leaves a net beneﬁt of just a better performance net to us, and that's
positive to the ROE. It's clear.
We have not necessarily tried to match the exact ROE beneﬁt with that dynamic. But given
the strong combined ratios we've delivered despite higher CPCs that's positive, and then
we capture the distribution income in our ROE calculation. So I think net-net, it's positive.
It's just -- I wouldn't be able to take a number speciﬁcally to the pandemic portion of it.

Q - Michael Phillips

{BIO 21023048 <GO>}

Okay. Just my second question is, just as we're starting to see more growth in terms of
sales of electric vehicles, what sort of work or what have you done to give yourself comfort
around appropriately pricing auto insurance policies for EVs to avoid negative surprises
down the road?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. It's interesting, Geoﬀ. So ﬁrst of all, it's not a big portion of the car pool. I'll just say
that. And second, there's a very diﬀerent proﬁle in terms of claims both frequency and
severity within the electric vehicle category, where the diﬀerence for cheaper electric
vehicle is quite not the diﬀerence, but the patterns are very diﬀerent for the more
expensive electric vehicles. So it's hard to generalize. I'll ask Isabelle to share her
perspective on that because she's pricing for these diﬀerences.

A - Isabelle Girard

{BIO 17342111 <GO>}

Yes. So we've talked about in the past, our pricing segmentation that is quite precise with
machine learning, but also with the data we have internally. So despite the electric
vehicles being a small proportion of the pool of vehicle, we're working with our claims
colleagues to look at the data we have, and we price each make, model and year
individually, and that include the electric vehicles as well. So we're able to be very
segmented in our pricing to reﬂect diﬀerent types of costs we may have for those
vehicles, and that's what we've been doing in the past and continuing to do the more we
get information and data on those vehicles.

FINAL

Yeah, hi. good morning. First question, just in -- still in personal auto with driving seeming
to begin to normalize and severity a little bit higher. Can you talk about the timing for
when you might start to think or even -- or maybe you are in the process of ﬁling for rate
hike approvals in various provinces? Can you just sort of talk us through where you are on
that stage?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. Isabelle, why don't you share your perspective on that? Maybe talk a little bit about
seasonality as well in personal automobile, which I think is relevant for people to assess
the sort of run rate and where this is going.

A - Isabelle Girard

{BIO 17342111 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. So as you mentioned, driving is normalizing, but there are still a few things that
continue to evolve, and we're really focusing on following those trends. Frequency
remains below historical level because people are still readjusting their driving habits and
we've been proactive throughout the whole pandemic to follow this and readjust our
rating strategy accordingly. So it's not only that we made one move in our rates and that
we're waiting for the new norm to adapt. We've been continuously adapting it throughout
the situation. So that's maybe one point to clarify.
We also see, as Charles mentioned, seasonality in the two lines of business that have
impact on frequency. We're entering into the fourth quarter with the winter period where
we can see spikes in frequency that are related to weather events. So just to give you a
perspective, on Q4, we expect around 3 points of unfavorable seasonality relative to
personal two lines of business. So that's also something that we'll need to take into
account. And a bit like Patrick mentioned, on the severity side, while we've been at this for
many years now, we also need to make sure that we follow the trends and readjust to the
new norm that may comes out from the pandemic.
So all that saying that we've been quite active during the pandemic to adjust our rating
strategy to this. We're continuing to be very proactive in communication with regulators
on what we see to make sure they are aware of our relief eﬀort, of our strategy as well and
the gradual approach we want to take going forward to reﬂect the new normal.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

So as I said, Jaeme, at the start, we provided a fair bit of relief as a onetime relief payment
to Canadians, done the same thing in SME, adjusted rates where we felt that driving
patterns would be diﬀerent for an extended period of time. But we've done it in a way
where we can react very quickly from a pricing point of view should driving patterns shoot
up. We did not put ourselves in a position whereby you price 12 months out and then 3, 4,
5 months into your pricing cycle, driving a shot back up.
And the regulators, I think, have been constructive in this process understanding that this
environment is very, very -- it's a new zone. And as such, we've created optionality, but
we've given a lot of relief so far but not all true rates, some of it, as I said, through one

Page 15 of 25

shot payments because we felt rating is tricky here because you price for 12 months and
the world is changing.

FINAL

Q - Jamie Gloyn
Got it. Understood. Second question is on the UK performance in this quarter looks good
on the combined ratio. But I want to focus in more on the premium side of the equation. It
looks like ﬂat in personal and reﬂecting hard markets in commercial. I was just hoping you
could give us a little bit more color and frame how premiums look this quarter versus the
industry growth rates? And then frame some of the dynamics that are at play and how we
should expect that premiums to evolve in both personal and commercial lines in the UK?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. High level, I mean, look, it is early. But since closing, what have we done? I've talked
earlier in my remarks in terms of putting action plans to improve pricing and risk
selection, okay? So that is critical as far as I'm concerned to create outperformance in the
UK. The team had built a lot of good momentum. These results that you're seeing this
quarter are not the product of the actions we've put in place this quarter. They are the
product of the work of the team over the past few years.
And so ﬁrst point, pricing, risk selection improvements. Second point, rationalizing the
footprint of the organization. We want to make sure that we play where we can win, and
we want to make sure that we play where the economics are favorable to us. And so
there's a number of elements across the platform in both personal and in commercial
lines at the moment, where we're trimming positions in certain distribution relationships
and so on.
And then the third element that is coming is the pricing reforms in personal lines in early
'22 that one needs to take into account. There is a big dislocation at the industry between
new business pricing and renewal pricing, new business pricing being lower than renewal
pricing, the regulatory change, which I think is quite good, will level up new business and
renewal pricing. This will create, I think, opportunities in the marketplace, but the personal
lines environment in the UK and certainly in the ﬁrst part of 2022 will likely be quite
dislocated.
So when you put all that together, I see a couple of things. In commercial lines, you're in a
healthy hard market environment, we're curtailing our position in certain segments but I
do expect healthy growth in that line of business and an expansion of our margins there in
commercial lines. And not inconsistent, I guess, with where we are in the cycle in
relationship with the inﬂation, both in Canada as well as in the US. First line is a whole
diﬀerent ball game for the 3 reasons that I've mentioned.
We are curtailing the footprint. We're bringing pricing improvement. And then there are
the reforms and the team's perspective, and they've been very disciplined this year. That's
why you're not seeing much growth in personal lines. We're just not densing with the
market gyration here, we have a rise ﬁrmly focused on the combined ratio, we have our
eyes on creating outperformance.

Page 16 of 25

FINAL

And I do expect that we won't see much growth in personal lines in the near term as
regulations work through the system. And as performance improvement measures roll out
in personal lines in the UK. There might be growth opportunities as a result of the reforms.
And if there are, we'll be there to capture them. But we are in a moment where we want to
make sure we're positioned to create outperformance. And as such, I wouldn't bank on
rapid growth in personal lines in the near term.

Bloomberg Transcript

Hey, good morning, Charles. A couple of questions here for you. I just want to dig in a
little bit more on the physical damage severity in personal auto. I appreciate the answer
with respect to used car prices up, but you're selling the scraps, obviously, for more
money, so that helps oﬀset it.
But that also would imply that parts inﬂation is potentially pressure on severity as well.
And are you seeing that from parts inﬂation as well as other supply chain issues like
getting cars ﬁxed and back in the road, additional rental car prices, those things. Are you
seeing that? And I guess, as a follow-on to that, does Intact have things in place to help
mitigate that and kind of have an advantage over the industry in mitigating the severity?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. I think it's really good to go one layer down, Brian, because you're right. There is
stuﬀ happening in the supply chain that is changing the mix a little bit, and I'll let Patrick
provide his perspective on labor in the state of the repair industry. And probably
worthwhile, Patrick, going back on a number of the measures we've put in place 2, 3 years
ago to deal with the inﬂation that we've been focused on in physical damage just to give a
sense to Brian, of the advantages that we have from a claims management and a supply
chain management point of view.

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Right. So Brian, from -- on the parts side, in Canada so far, we don't see a ton of disruption
in terms of availability of parts. For sure, like many other industries, this industry is facing a
hard labor market. And -- but so far, it hasn't had a ton of impact on our cost. The
frequency overall being lower and the way we approach our Rely Network. So we have
good capacity within our preferred providers. So that, I think, is one of the key advantage
that we've built over the years, and we have good capacity, not only for current levels of
frequency, but even as it returns towards normal. So that's one, I think, a key important
aspect.

FINAL

On the used car parts, there's a portion of the salvage I focused on selling the salvage
cars, four parts, but there's also an auction process where some of these cars actually
bought and repaired because of the demand in the -- so it's not only all of it used in parts.
With regards to some of the other advantages and actions that we've taken, a big portion
-- an important part of what we've done in the past 2, 3 years is leveraging our data and
deploy it to the front line of claims. So one of the key elements in controlling costs in this
environment with higher technology, more complex repairs is to be able to make quick
decisions right from the ﬁrst call or the ﬁrst notice of loss with our clients in terms of will
we repair that car or will we declare a total loss and replace it? Because then you can
direct the client more eﬃciently at the right place, avoid multiple towing costs, storage
fees and all of these things that also increase the length of time we have to provide a
rental.
So by leveraging our data and claims and the data lab, we've deployed tools that can
quickly identify this. And we've seen savings actually with these actions on the rental the
towing, the storage, which are, at the end, also a signiﬁcant part of the repair process.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Then I think worth also mentioning that ordering automobile parts is something we've
been doing to fully leverage our scale over time. We've been doing that for many years,
but that certainly comes in handy in a world where there are inﬂationary pressure.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Makes sense. And then my next question is sticking with personal auto. 1% organic
growth. Obviously, there's some headwinds with respect to BC. But I'm just curious, are
you being more cautious with growth in Canada in personal auto given the integration of
RSA and maybe some uncertainty with respect to claims inﬂation. Why isn't this a time that
you're really trying to get some organic growth?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Well, yes, I think that if we could get more organic growth at the conditions we think are
right from -- and I think with the point of view, we would, Brian, no doubt about it. We're
well positioned. We've done a lot of work in automobile insurance for many years. We
think that we priced adequately and we'd love to grow.
I think part of the issue, if I peel that onion, I would say there's not a lot of -- I don't want to
use the word traﬃc because that would be confusing but shopping is down. Retention is
up historically high, shopping is down. And as such, the cost of generating sales is up
meaningfully, okay? So that's the ﬁrst thing that one needs to take into account, at least
that's how we think about the business. So that's the ﬁrst point.
The second point is that when you price a product, you price 12 months out using 3 years
-- 3 to 5 years of historical data. Right now, how much credibility do you put on the driving
patterns you've seen in the last 6 months? Some people put a fair bit of credibility and
took aggressive rate actions, we didn't we reﬂected risk. We provided a ton of relief, but
Page 18 of 25



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp

Date: 2021-11-10

FINAL

we understand that if the world changes in 3 to 6 months from now, and we're pricing 12
months out, we have to have some degree of caution.
And as a result, our ability to sell is maybe not as good as it's been historically. So then
there's -- you put all that together, Brian, there's the cost of generating traﬃc, there's how
competitive one is. And then there's how much do you think you should charge for a
world that will gradually return to normal over the pricing period and you get a sluggish
growth in commercial and personal lines in the near term, let alone the fact that there's
not much rates going around.
And so that is the issue. If we could grow more in personal automobile, we would,
because we're comfortable with how that business is positioned to perform in the mid-to
long term. But the dynamics in the marketplace are such that it's not easy to grow.
Isabelle, I don't know if there's anything -- any additional color you want to provide here.

A - Isabelle Girard

{BIO 17342111 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I think you said it right. I think the right momentum and pulse, for sure. It's not the main
driver of growth these days. I think because of that as well, our retention is all being very
strong, but that creates less moments for shopping for customers in the market in general.
And maybe I would just add, we also see less new vehicle sales versus historical in the last
few months. So that's also reducing the shopping moments for our customers. So we
believe also it's one driver of why we're seeing less people shopping for insurance than
historical.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Good afternoon. Charles, it would seem to me that over the next 12, 18 months, a lot is
going to change for your company. But one area in particular that I'm focused on is
personal lines in the UK where the change could be the most sort of fundamental. What
I'm going with is, does your companies -- in fact, have to be a personal lines player in the
UK Is there some either regulatory reason or maybe it's relevant because it helps to
absorb overall costs in the organization. But do you think Intact needs to be a personal
lines player in the UK at all?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

It's a key strategic question, Mario. You went straight to what -- I think is an important
question in relationship with the UK. Keep in mind, we're number two in home insurance,
we're very strong in pet insurance, and both these lines of business are performing really
Page 19 of 25

FINAL

well. And so I would consider that this is a position of strength to a certain extent. We're
very small in motor. Keep in mind, we're, I think, 17th, 18th, I forget exactly what position
we are. Motor is 1% of Intact Financial's revenue base, 1% motor in the UK.
And so I think you want to make sure you can win in that segment. No doubt about it. But
I think there are strengths in personal lines. The exercise we're going through with the
team right now is how do we position ourselves to win in personal lines in the UK.? How
do we position ourselves to outperform? Can we win? How do we position ourselves to
outperform pricing, risk selection, claims a no-brainer. But then can you outperform and
grow is the question? And is outperformance generating adequate returns on capital?
These are the questions that are on the table, Mario, we closed the deal in June, we've
put in place near-term proﬁtability improvement plan. Auto is 1% of Intact Financial's
revenue base, personal lines is 7% of Intact Financial's revenue base. There are strengths
there but we're actively engaging with the team to make sure that the business in the UK
is positioned where we can win, where we can outperform and where we can generate a
return that compensates for the risk that we're taking.
And so I think your question is deﬁnitely one that is looked into. I do think there's strength
and we want to build on that.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

One sort of related question then. In the UK, is there a bundling dynamic between auto
and home that would necessitate keeping an auto business to maintain the strong
position you have in property insurance?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

No. Much less than Canada. In fact, in Canada, we have far more overlap between
personal automobile, home insurance. In fact, we have a single product or a single oﬀer
for both products in the Canadian marketplace. In the U.K., there's a much greater
dichotomy is our observation between both these products. So I don't -- from the basis of
customer experience, I don't see the connection there. The question is, you need both to
have a solid, credible personal lines platform with distributors. I think that is the bigger
question as opposed to whether customers look for base. Can you cross sell? I think you
can, but I'm not seeing a ton of evidence as that it's been done eﬀectively in that market.

Yeah. Thanks very much. Good afternoon. Sort of progressing a little bit on that
questioning. What have you learned now? It's been probably like 5 months since you
closed the RSA deal, in particular, of the UK&I, what kind of businesses have surprised you
either on the upside or the downside? You talk about being more comfortable with your
RSA accretion targets and more comfortable with achieving your cost synergies targets.
To what extent is some of that attributable to your outlook on the UK&I and which
businesses are sort of surprising either on the upside or downside with respect to that?
Thanks.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. I'll ask Louis to chip in. If I start at a high level, what are we very pleased with from an
upside point of view is the quality of the people we have on the ground in the UK. Second
to none, there's a lot of strength there, and we want to build on that. I think that I'm
impressed and thrilled about the opportunity that exists in the midsized commercial lines
business in the UK the opportunities that exist in the regions.

Bloomberg Transcript

We built our Canadian business as a very deep local footprint where we work with brokers
to own, you know, not own, but have a very deep presence in the small and midsized
space. We insure one in four businesses in Canada. We understand the regions, we
understand the brokers, and we understand the SME space.
RSA in the UK, ﬁrst of all, super strong brand, very well respected. I was with brokers
actually last night talking exactly about the competitive set in the UK and the
opportunities that exist in midsize. And you know what, I think there's a meaningful
commercial lines opportunity. And the RSA team has a very strong regional franchise, very
strong regional platform. And clearly that is an area of surprise in terms of upside, not so
much in terms of performance because we knew what the sort of performance we were
looking at coming in this transaction, but rather size of the opportunity.
The areas where that need works, we had a really good sense of as well. And I would put
them in three buckets, and these are three buckets where we're focused. First motor, the
performance in automobile insurance, that are referred to as motor in the UK, needs a lot
of work, and there's a lot of actions focused on that to improve that performance.
The second area is at the small end of commercial lines. There's a fair bit of dislocation in
the marketplace and there's work to do on the performance of the very small end of
commercial lines. We're focused on rationalizing the footprint there.
And the third bucket, which we knew would be challenging, but we're focused on
rationalizing the footprint there is that there's a number of distribution relationships in
both personal lines and commercial lines where the economics are not stacked enough in
favor of our operations, and we're shrinking the footprint there because we need to be
focused as a ﬁrm.
So these would be the three areas where I would say it's upside, but work is needed to
create upside there. And I think there's a big growth opportunity in midsized commercial
lines in the UK.,

The specialty lines business, whether it's the London market business, the marine
business and so on, I think the connections that we're treating now with North America
will give us access to a broader pool of customers. And that's why the global SL
capabilities, in my mind, is an opportunity. I think this is an area where the competitive set
is thin as far as I'm concerned. The environment or the ecosystem is really conducive to us
stepping up our global capabilities, and we're focused on that. Numbers, they're in line
with what we thought are better. And so I'll let Louis give his perspective on that. The
numbers, you know, they are in line what we though are better and so all let Louis give his
perspective on that.

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Thanks, Charles. So yes, the numbers are better. The team in the UK was already on the
path of improvement. So we're sort of trying to make sure we keep on that path and make
the corrections we think are required here. Maybe one area that is attracting a bit of
attention to is the technology in the UK and what needs to be done to deliver on the
outperformance targets we set for ourselves.

Bloomberg Transcript

But if I come back to synergies, the conﬁdence is really coming from all the markets that
we've added to our platform. And you'll remember that most of the synergies are coming
from Canada. So the conﬁdence is both how we're executing in Canada, how we're
executing in Europe and that drives the comments of being -- feeling conﬁdent that we
could beat the target of 250.
And just we see the execution so far. I talked earlier about having $24 million already
earned after four months, run rate at the end of the year at $85 million. It just makes us
more conﬁdent as we work closer with the teams, both in Canada and in the UK that those
targets are achievable, and we look to try to beat them

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Yes. And as a follow-on, I think that 250 doesn't include any kind of loss ratio potential
improvements, which you were able to get when you bought OneBeacon. Is there
anything you can share with us just in this 4 months of RSA in terms of any kind of loss
ratio improvements?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

So you're right. They are not included in the 250. And I will say we're -- this is really what's
being done now in terms of putting our minds together, developing the strategies and
trying to generate additional loss ratio improvements. At this point, I will say I don't think
there's a lot of visibility in the very short term, but we certainly think there's going to be
some upside in the mid to longer term improve the loss ratio. But at this -- we're not
quantifying that yet. It's still a bit early.

FINAL

Yes, I think that's exactly right. I think, Tom, the deal was not predicated on loss ratio
improvements. And our guidance is on what the deal was predicated on. Now clearly, we
have action plans to improve performance. But we want to make sure that we have good
visibility on it before we start putting numbers on the table. In the meantime, I think Louis
has been clear about the IRR now that we see on this transaction, this should convey
conﬁdence that we're well on our way.

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Operator
Your next question comes from Lemar Persaud of Cormark. Please go ahead,

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Lemar Persaud

{BIO 20750088 <GO>}

Thank you. So my ﬁrst question is just continuing along the discussion on the opportunity
synergies. So I'm wondering if you can help me understand which geographies are
outperforming your expectations the most? And is there anything you can do to help us
ring fence around how much your synergies are expected to come in at? I'll tell you where
I'm going with this, like going back to Louis comments on $85 million run rate synergies
by the end of 2021. It sounds like this outperformance can be pretty substantial,
extrapolated over 36 months. And then also, when I think back to the announcement of
the DOL [ph] it always felt like you assumed synergies, particularly in the UK&I was
relatively conservative in nature. So anything you guys can oﬀer on that would be helpful?
Thanks.

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

So on the ﬁrst part of the question, so we are tracking, I would say, ahead of schedule that
doesn't mean that the quantum will be hugely diﬀerent than the target we set, but the
timing might be a bit better than we anticipated. And I'd say we're giving accretion
numbers right now that are earlier than what we initially anticipated. You'll remember our
guidance was upper single by 12 months. I think we're there faster. And we're there
against a strong stand-alone performance from IFC.
So I think -- and this drives a bit the perception that we -- the IRR is a bit better than we
thought at the beginning because we're going faster than expected, but I would not
necessarily change the targets. It's just the timing at which they'll be met that I think is
going faster than we had anticipated.
In terms of the markets or the geographies where they're being delivered, I would stick to
our initial guidance around three quarters being in Canada and the rest being in the UK.
And you have to remember here, we did not have a business in the UK to start with to
generate the synergies. So most of the for that part of the acquisition were sort of head
oﬃce synergies, corporate or common costs, group costs that we could eliminate
because they would become redundant, but in the operations themselves harder because

we didn't have an operation of our own to blend with. So that's why that was heavily
weighted towards Canada.

FINAL

If you look at Canada, it's 6 points, I would say, of combined ratio. When you take the
synergies we're targeting, that is very consistent with the prior big acquisition, which was
AXA back [ph] in 2011. So it's a similar quantum, if you want and that's well on its way to
being realized within the time frame we set for ourselves.

Q - Lemar Persaud

{BIO 20750088 <GO>}

Thank you. And then my second question is just on distribution EBITDA. Again, it
continues to be stronger than expected. I'm wondering if you could breakdown, how
much of this growth was organic versus M&A? And then more broadly, what factors could
cause this growth to slow?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

So the breakdown here, just simply said, if I take 29% quarter-over-quarter improvement,
two thirds of that is additional variable commissions. So two thirds is, I would there, stay
pretty much organic. And then third is recent M&A activity for both our BrokerLink
business, as well as our broker ﬁnancial services business. So the majority of it is organic,
but there's a fair contribution from M&A.

Bloomberg Transcript

I would say the market is fairly active these days. There's a lot of activity going on in the
M&A front. So our perception that momentum will continue is supported by both the
performance of the business as well as the market environment.

Q - Lemar Persaud

{BIO 20750088 <GO>}

Thanks. That's helpful.
