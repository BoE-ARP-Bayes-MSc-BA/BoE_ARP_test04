MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. This is Gianandrea Roberti, Head of Investor Relations at Tryg.
We published our Q3 results earlier on this morning. And I have here with me Group
CEO, Morten Hübbe and Group CFO, Christian Baltzer, to discuss the numbers. So, after a
few words, over to you, Morten.

Morten Hübbe
Thanks, Gian. And we start out on slide three, showing signiﬁcantly higher results, both
from insurance and in particular, investment. And bear in mind the very high swing factor
from global equities from Q3 last year to Q3 this year.
On the technical result, we report an increase of DKK 100 million, but bear in mind, we
have the negative impact of DKK 120 million last year, so roughly in line year-on-year.
Premium development is as expected. We see positive growth in the largest business
segment, Private Nordic, now for the ﬁfth quarter in a row. But now also new in this
quarter, we see positive growth in Sweden even before the Skandia transaction. We
report, we believe, a healthy solvency ratio of 217 including the Skandia transaction.

FINAL

If we jump to slide four, we show an all time high of NPS of 24. Clearly, this is a KPI that
will be more volatile over time, but we do see a positive development. When we look at
customers with three or more products, we see a good improvement in Private Denmark
with an increase of 1.6 percentage point. And on the other hand, we see a reduction in
Norway, which we need to improve with our work on (1:49) and on our new customer
programs. The retention rate at 88% is a slightly lower level than last year, mainly due to a
drop in Commercial.
If we turn to slide number seven, premiums are broadly ﬂat, but they are positively
impacted by two months of impact from Skandia – sorry, that is one-month impact from
Skandia and also somewhat negatively impacted by one-oﬀ positive top-line in
Commercial in Q3 last year.
Private lines Denmark continues to be the most positive this quarter with a top-line growth
of 2.2% where, clearly, Commercial is more challenged in both Denmark and Norway.
Corporate is quite ﬂat, but we believe that growth is not the main focus area in the
Corporate segment.

Bloomberg Transcript

On slide eight, we show the technical result of DKK 744 million, as we said, roughly in line
with Q3 last year adjusted for the negative one-oﬀ charge last year of DKK 120 million. If
we adjust for run-oﬀ weather and large claims, the results of Private and Commercial are
roughly in line with Q3 last year and Christian will get back to the underlying. But, clearly,
we see that mid-sized claims in Corporate plays a big impact this quarter. mid-sized
claims in Corporate are roughly DKK 70 million higher year-on-year which has some
impact on the group numbers, both reported and underlying.
If we look at slide nine, the most important story is that we continue to see an improved
trend in Denmark where the fact that we are gradually adjusting prices and converting
into new products means that the negative trend on price is improving and that is both
due to the conversions and the price changes and we are seeing in the conversions that
customers are increasing their coverage. Norwegian prices continues to move slightly up,
reﬂecting price adjustments.
If we look at slide 10, I guess the general story on customer retention is quite stable. For
Private lines, it's stable. We see perhaps the most positive that Commercial Norway has
had a positive development in Q3. Commercial Norway is the area where our customer
satisfaction has been the lowest and we have worked a lot on improving customer focus,
customer servicing and customer NPS. And that is now starting to improve and that also
has a positive impact on the retention of Commercial Norway, while on the other hand,
Commercial Denmark still has some negative impact by price increases.
And over to you, Christian.

Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

Thank you, Morten. And turning your heads to slide 12, where you try to have displayed
the underlying claims ratio for the diﬀerent segments. For group level, you see an uplift of
Page 2 of 19

Date: 2016-10-11

FINAL

2.2 percentage points. As Morten mentioned most of this is driven by the mid-sized
claims of about DKK 70 million in our Corporate segment. If you look at Commercial in
Sweden they are more or less on par compared to last year. Private is up 0.1 percentage
point and we still reiterate our expectation at the beginning of 2017 to see the underlying
improvement on the Private side.
Turning your heads to slide 13, this is the topic that we started discussing last quarter,
which was these increased tech development in cars and how the claims are increasing in
size given the more tech that you put into these cars. And we're happy to see that other
companies are also reporting some of the same trends.
Now, one of the new things we are bringing to this topic is that we do see a trend increase
in the accident. I think it's about 5% increase in 2016 if you look year-to-date, this is on a
national basis in Denmark. Now, we have speculation what the reasons are on this and I
also believe that Council for Safe Traﬃc in Denmark actually are expecting this to be a lot
about unaware drivers or people driving with not that much attention to the road and
more to their phones or other things in their cars. Studies have actually shown that almost
69% of the claims that we have comes from unaware drivers.

Bloomberg Transcript

And there's also been studies showing that there's a six time higher risk if you are texting
while driving to get into an accident. Whether this is the reason for the increasing
accident, I think that we can speculate but we're keeping a focus on this development that
taking our – and just making sure we have initiatives to oﬀset this.
One last indicator that we have been looking on that might speculate some of this data
usage in cars is the increased amount of just data used overall in Denmark. I think we're
going keep talking about this topic the coming quarters and hopefully we'll see a
ﬂattening out of some of these trends at one point.
Turning to slide 14, as Morten mentioned, large claims and weather claims has been
somewhat fortunate this quarter with not that much of it and we have also seen a run-oﬀ
level less than we did in same quarter last year. However, the run-oﬀ level is more or less
in line with our expectation. If you do total these three diﬀerent components up, it's about
DKK 100 million diﬀerence compared to last quarter that we have negative and most of
that is explained by the DKK 70 million in mid-sized claims.
Turning to slide 15, we have a status on our eﬃciency program. And in third quarter, we
reported DKK 55 million saving. I think it's important now that we are a little over midway
through our eﬃciency program to kind of sum up and see how is it going, how are we
doing. And currently, for these seven quarters, we have had an achievement about DKK
316 million versus a total target for 2016 and 2015 of DKK 375 million.
So that means that the DKK 59 million for fourth quarter 2016's will make sure that we are
on target with our program, which we believe deﬁnitely we'll make. 2017 is also in line and
has initiatives to support the total of DKK 750 million in savings program.

FINAL

Assuming a little bit in on our savings program on the DKK 250 million in cost reduction,
we continue having structural initiatives within the organization to support this DKK 250
million savings. And especially in the second quarter and third quarter, Norway has done
signiﬁcant improvement on this side. Overall, the organization is very focused and
dedicated and ﬁnding a lot of good initiatives to reach our target of 14% or below in 2017.
Turning to the investment side, which Morten already mentioned, was very positive
compared to same quarter last year, mainly because same quarter last year was extremely
negative. We have the investment return of DKK 191 million versus the DKK 441 million last
year.
It's especially due to the equity side giving us the good performance, but also on the
match performance, we're seeing some improvement, deﬁnitely driven by the Nordic
cover bond spread has narrowed towards the swap curve. But in general, if you look at
our asset classes, they have had positive results, which were really – have about – giving
that tailwind for this quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to slide 19, we report our solvency position. And based on our partial internal
model, we have a solvency ratio of 217. This is the quarter where Skandia is ﬂowing into
our numbers. And as you might have noticed, it's a little less than we actually anticipated
upfront, but due to having looked more into the actual book and assessing it, we're
ﬁnding that our estimated upfront was a little conservative. And now, we have ﬂown them
into the numbers, which we think is much more correct.
There's also been an improvement on our non-life, which is an improvement on our
partial internal model that has given us about a DKK 38 million improvement on the SCR.
Overall, the SCR is more or less in line with what it was at Q2 2016.
And on our own funds, it's mainly driven by a quarter where we are not paying out
dividend and not having any share buyback. So, it's a quarter where you see a signiﬁcant
increase in own funds. The only negative part of the own funds is the Skandia portfolio
ﬂowing in.
Turning to slide 20, our capital and solvency position, we think it's important for us to say
that right now, there's about DKK 211 million of Tier 2 that is not included since our own
funds is capped by a 50% of the SCR. We still have ATier 1 capacity of about DKK 1.3
billion that we have not any assumption of using right now, but it's important for you guys
to know that we have more ways of raising capital if needed.
And my last slide would be 21. It's all about solvency ratio sensitivity, which is a broadly
unchanged picture. It remains low.
So back to you, Morten.

FINAL

Thank you, Christian. And just a ﬁnal few comments on slide 22, where we reiterate our
ﬁnancial targets for 2017 with an ROE at or above 21% post-tax, combined ratio at or
below 87%, and an expense ratio at or below 14%.
As you know, we have initiated price adjustments to mitigate the claims inﬂation we've
seen in the recent year-and-a-half, particularly in property and travel, also during smaller
price adjustments in a number of other products. We know that it takes some time before
we see the full impact of that, but we do expect to see full impact during 2017 where we
expect to see underlying claims reduce.
Also, we work very hard on our savings program, where particularly, Norway has done a
number of the larger initiatives these last few months. It doesn't impact the 2016 numbers
yet, but it does impact the 2017 numbers and the pipeline of securing our 14% target.
As far as top-line is concerned, we reiterate our previous quarter statement that we expect
the top-line to be at the very low end of the interval 0 to 2%. The main driver being the
smaller price adjustments, but also the gradual inclusion of Skandia child insurance, which
will ﬂow somewhat into Q4 and mainly into 2017.
And then I guess on slide 23, we continue to focus on dividends being a very, very
important cornerstone of our business model.

Bloomberg Transcript

And with that, I think we will turn to your questions.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. And our ﬁrst question comes from the line of Asbjørn Mørk from Danske Bank.
Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Asbjørn Nicholas Mørk
Yes. Good morning. Asbjørn from Danske here. Three questions from my side. First, on
the retention on the Danish-covered business bond. You said that the decline was due to
price hikes. But I was just wondering, is the TryghedsGruppen bonus payment that you
paid in June, why haven't we seen any impact from this in the numbers, or maybe we
have been and your underlying would have been worse than that. So maybe you can
elaborate a little bit on that.
Then on your claims side, if you look at the underlying claims as you also touched on in
the presentation, there seems to be continued inﬂation. I was just wondering if this recent
trend is in line with your – you can say your price hikes that you have done during 2016 or
whether they are above and that you actually need to do a little bit more on pricing to
reach your longer term targets.

FINAL

And then on your cost side, you're guiding 14% for next year. Then if I look at the inﬂation
that you'll be facing next couple of years and I look at the potential that you have from the
digitalization that you mentioned on the Analyst Day in June, I was just wondering how
should we see the cost ratio looking beyond 2017. If you still think that 14% is a sustainable
level also in 2018 and onwards. Thank you.

A - Morten Hübbe
Good morning to you, Asbjørn. If I take the ﬁrst and third question. As far as retention
Commercial Denmark is concerned, we've been working very hard to secure that the
price changes we do, particularly in Private, are more and more intelligent, more and
more gradual to the right customers at the right levels to secure that they are successful
and the customers stay with us.

Bloomberg Transcript

To be honest, the price changes we've done in Commercial Denmark have been more
primitive as far as distribution with new customers, old customers lines of business
diﬀerentiation and therefore the impact has been slightly higher than it ought to have
been. And I think in future price changes in Commercial Denmark, we will use more of the
intelligence from Private lines and also the data we've gathered from customer reaction to
the price changes this time around.
I think as far as the bonus is concerned, we're seeing that, particularly high-end corporate
customers are starting to understand whereas the majority of Commercial, SME and
Private lines customers still are very new to this customer bonus program. So, I don't think
we at all see that impact that you are searching for yet. And I also think that in Norway,
(16:40) show that it takes a couple of years to get the full impact of that. So, on the
positive side that is more ahead of us than something that we've seen so far.
As far as your cost 14% is concerned, I think we need to work very hard to secure that we
deliver the 14% during 2017. So I don't think we want to speculate on what happens after
that, but, of course, it doesn't make sense for us to deliver 14% and then let the cost ratio
increase afterwards, so that is clearly not the plan. But what happens after 2017 is
something I think we should debate later in 2017.

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

Morning, Asbjørn. I'll talk a little bit to your underlying question, not underlying question,
but your underlying claims ratio question. I think that the Private that we are seeing, in Q1,
we had a 0.9% deterioration, Q2 was a 0.7% and now a 0.6% deterioration. It's an
improvement in the underlying deterioration of the portfolio and it's very much in line
with our expectation, which is also why we reiterate our expectation of beginning of 2017
seeing that change. So it doesn't change our view on pricing, it doesn't change our view
on the initiatives. Those are going as planned.
I think when we pick up this auto discussion, I think that's one of our early warnings that
there might be something going on in the portfolio that we need to keep a very close eye
on and also make sure that our colleagues in the insurance industry have a discussion

Page 6 of 19



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2016-10-11

about what are we doing with this auto inﬂation that we're actually seeing. So hopefully
that answers your question, Asbjørn.

FINAL

Q - Asbjørn Nicholas Mørk
Yes. Thank you very much. If I could just get back to the ﬁrst question, Morten, then on the
retention. If you try to adjust for, you can say, unproﬁtable workers' compensation
business and other areas where you basically don't want to be in, would the retention rate
then look substantially diﬀerent from what we're seeing right now?

A - Morten Hübbe
No. I think, to be honest that the retention, the slight – and bear in mind, it is a slight
reduction, it's nothing dramatic. But the slight reduction also covers other products like
property, for instance, also commercial and motor. So, it's really more that if we are too
primitive in the way we carry out price adjustments, then the reaction is higher than it
need to be. And I think we have improved that process signiﬁcantly in Private lines
whereas Commercial lines is not at the same level of sophistication.
So it's not just a workers' comp issue, it's more a matter of sophistication and the price
change modeling where we need to be more at the level of Private lines and Commercial.
And that will be what we'll do in the future price changes. But the impact has been slightly
higher than it really needed to be. So, I think, we can thank ourselves for that, but also say,
put into perspective, it is a relatively small downward change.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Asbjørn Nicholas Mørk
Sure. Sure. And thank you very much. Very clear. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jakob Brink from ABG. Please go
ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Thank you very much and good morning. I have two questions, please. The ﬁrst one is
actually getting back to Asbjørn's on the underlying claims ratio. I do see what you're
saying that 90 basis points, then 70 and now 60. So you're saying that in early 2017, we
should start to see improvement. So would that be in Q1 or Q2 or could you get a little
closer? And also, maybe give us a bit more insight to why would it signiﬁcantly drop in the
sort of end of this year, or beginning of next year? I know that there'll be more price
increases coming through, but I guess only one more quarter.
And also, now, you talk a lot about the Private underlying claims ratio and I do
acknowledge of course that your Commercial is much more volatile, but could you give
some insights into that one and the Corporate as well, or basically the group underlying
claims ratio.

Page 7 of 19

FINAL

My other question is about the solvency. As you pointed out, it's very strong this quarter. I
know you haven't given a speciﬁc target, but given what you wrote in connection with the
transfer to Solvency II, I guess it seems like you are signiﬁcantly above what could have
been your target, even though you didn't say one. So should we basically expect you to
maybe increase the share buybacks for 2017, or how do you look at this? Thanks.

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

Good morning, Jakob. I think I'll try to answer both your questions. Firstly, on the
underlying claims ratio, I think if you go back in our kind of – I think you have to take a
couple of steps back. It was in Q4 2015 we actually started reporting the ﬁrst type of
negative trend into underlying claims ratio and it's also when we started to plan for
initiatives into the portfolio that we started up in Q1. It takes 24 months for these price
initiatives to actually ﬂow through the numbers, whereas the mass of the initiatives actually
comes in Q4 – I mean, takes about four, ﬁve, six quarters to get more or less the most
impact and you get the full impact after the eight quarters.
Now, bear in mind that there is still volatility in the underlying claims ratio for Private. It is
not a speciﬁc kind of number that it's not volatile at all, but I think you could expect that
when we say beginning of 2017, it would be probably the ﬁrst couple of quarters, we
should start seeing that type of claims. Have...

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hübbe
And I guess, Jakob, for us it's really the full year 2017 will have a drop in the underlying
claims ratio. I don't think – we do not manage the portfolio to a degree of precision where
we know that that in Q1 is the ﬁrst time it drops. But you will start to see in the early parts
of 2017 indications that it drops and for the full year 2017, it will drop.

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

I think, Jakob, just remembering when we did Q1 2015, we actually had a lot of mid-sized
claims of ﬁres in Norway that actually inﬂated the underlying. So you do have those kind
of – that kind of volatility also in this underlying claims ratio.
Under Commercial and Corporate side, when we monetorize our underlying claims ratio
and tried to navigate our business, it is much more of the Private we use this KPI. On the
core Commercial and Corporate side, we look more on the kind of – some other KPIs that
we are not disclosing here because there are good amount of volatility. And the DKK 70
million in mid-sized claims just totally speaks to that kind of volatility (23:36) portfolio. We
also see that in the Commercial portfolio sometimes. This quarter, Commercial is more or
less in par with what it was last year. So that's what's driving a good amount of volatility
into underlying on those segments.

A - Morten Hübbe
I guess Christian, we can add, Jakob, that we are discussing internally, should we even
consider to leave out an underlying calculation of Corporate entirely because the level of
mid-sized claims and the volatile of that makes underlying a less meaningful exercise than

Page 8 of 19

FINAL

Corporate. But on the other hand, it makes sense to try to understand the group
underlying. So how do we manage that?
And we haven't come to a full conclusion. I guess, what we're saying as of now is that in
Private lines, it makes perfect sense; in Corporate lines, it makes very little sense, but we'd
like to ﬁnd the methodology to talk about the group underlying regardless. So we're
working on trying to ﬁgure out what are the adjustments we want to do there, reportingwise, in longer term sustainable model, so we don't change the reporting model too
often.

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

On your second question on the solvency ratio and us not guiding and whether you can
expect what to expect in the future, I will more or less plead the Fifth and not comment on
that. But, I mean, it is a very positive position that we're in. We're very happy with that and
comfortable with that. And I guess we'll talk more about this next quarter.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Okay, fair enough. Thanks a lot for the help.

Operator

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul De'Ath from RBC. Please go
ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Paul De'Ath
Yeah. Hi, guys. A couple of questions from me, please. Firstly, just the brief reference on
slide four to the new Cyber product that you've developed for the Corporate and
Commercial lines. And any more color you can give us on that in terms of where you think
that can go? There's lots of people getting quite excited about Cyber across the globe
really at the moment. So just some insight into that would be good.
And then, the second point was just going back to the customers with more than three
products. Obviously, the percentage there hasn't really moved very much in the last few
quarters. How conﬁdent are you that you can turn things around there and get up to the
target by 2017 and kind of can you give us a bit more detail as to what you're doing in
order to do that? Thanks.

A - Morten Hübbe
Well, good morning to you as well. As far as Cyber is concerned, I think clearly we've seen
that a lot of our Commercial and Corporate customers are really worried about this area.
We have seen Swedish analysis suggesting that roughly a ﬁfth of the Commercial SMEs
have been hit by cyber crime as of today. So it is a real issue.
The product we've done can help analyze and investigate and solve. It can also help
restore data and we can also help, of course, settle and pay for the period where they've

FINAL

not been able to run their business. We think that the longer term potential on this is high.
We choose a rather large degree of reinsurance, not to be overwhelmed by the risk and
the claims. And I think it will take some time to massage this into the market. I think that in
sort of a two-year, three-year time horizon, it will be a meaningful driver of top-line and
bottom-line, but I think it's really only during 2017 we'll start to see the ﬁrst numbers and I
think we'll report on that gradually. But longer term, I think it will be a fairly large market.
As far as kind of three or more products is concerned, you're right that the group number
is not really moving, but I think for us, it's very important to distinguish between two
underlying trends because in Private lines Denmark, we've now seen an increase of 1.6
percentage points on three or more products. And we are putting a number of resources
and initiatives into increasing new products to existing customers, understanding why
customers would leave with one product, working more with customer advice and
servicing, et cetera, to make sure we enhance the number of products; also in the
conversion processes, adding new coverages to existing customers. Those have been
some of the important drivers in Denmark, and I think we'll continue to see a positive
trend in Denmark towards our targets.

Bloomberg Transcript

Clearly, it was not part of our plan that this number should drop in Norway. And clearly,
that challenges the whole target for the group. What we're doing in Norway at the
moment is that we're taking our car dealer channel business where 80% of the customers
only have a car insurance. We have now, this quarter integrated that into our core
Norwegian Private line business to make sure we start systematically cross-selling to these
customers. That will be one important driver.
Another important driver is that our new customer program adds more value if you gather
more insurances in Norway. So, I think, bottom-line, a positive trend in Denmark, we think
that will continue. We deﬁnitely not planned for negative trend in Norway and we need to
turn that around. And whether we reach that for the – for 2017 or not in Norway, I don't
know, but making sure we turn it around and start to make it positive makes a lot of value
regardless of the timing.

Q - Paul De'Ath
Excellent. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of In-Yong Hwang from Goldman
Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - In-Yong Hwang

{BIO 18784369 <GO>}

Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I've got two. The ﬁrst one is just on the
mid-sized Corporate claims that you talked about earlier. Is it possible to get a bit more
color on where is it coming from? And, also, just clarify the DKK 70 million number that
you talked about, is that just all one-oﬀ or is there some business, I guess, underlying in
there as well?

Page 10 of 19

And the second question is on the capital structure. You mentioned that you're not
actively thinking about using the DKK 1.3 billion additional kind of Tier 1 capacity at the
moment. But what will be a catalyst for you to consider using that to M&A or could you
think about more an active optimization of your capital structure? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

Thank you. I'll try to just comment on your question. Morten, please chime in if you have
some. On the mid-sized claims in Corporate, I think that – oh most of this is coming from
on the Property side where we get claims that are between DKK 1 million to DKK to 10
million, which what we characterize as mid-sized. So we're targeting about maybe roughly
8, 9, 10 claims in this segment that we have more than we had same quarter last year.
It's not really uncommon to have that kind of ﬂuctuation within that portfolio at that size.
So, I don't want to put too much emphasis on these mid-sized claims. It's just when we try
to explain the result generation from last quarter to this quarter, this is just a larger
component this quarter than what we have seen the other quarters.
On the ATier 1, I think for us to kind of mention this is just to let you know that we have
more kind of stuﬀ in the drawer, so to speak, if we were to need it. We don't have any
plans, but you're right and some sort of initiative where we'd need to raise more capital it
would be a natural element to bring up, but there is no kind of earmark to this exercise so
far.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hübbe
And I guess In-Yong, whether we are talking about solvency ratio or a new Tier 1 capacity, I
think what it means is that we have more ﬂexibility to continue to work with our capital
position, but we have no short-term plans of making any changes in that area.

Morning, all. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two from me. So, ﬁrstly, on the retention
rates and the Net Promoter Score, so we've seen another spike in the Net Promoter Score,
but the retention isn't really moving, just like the customers with over three products, I
suppose. But I was just wondering, do you need to get that retention rate up to hit the
expense ratio target, i.e., through lower admin cost and acquisition cost to the extent that
you're not going direct or is it more of nice to have? So perhaps that's the ﬁrst question
ﬁrst, please.

Thank you very much. I think you're absolutely right. For us, the retention rate is a key
component to keeping our customers for longer and lowering our expense ratio. I think if
you go back to our – in 2014 when we committed to the 14%, we actually said one-third of
our expense improvement was going to come from people staying longer and using less
and actually new customers. So having as a little bit of a headwind on that deﬁnitely puts
some more pressure on being more eﬃcient to make our 14%. So it's not just nice to have,
it would be very nice to have, so to speak and that's why we keep focusing on that KPI.
I think the correlation between the retention rate and the Net Promoter Score, we still
have to kind of understand the dynamics of that. Don't forget that the Net Promoter Score
is only – (34:08) 1,000 people that are asked every month a quarter. And so, you only get
a subset of the people that might leave or not leave.
But what we do see is that people that have had a claim with us that have been in
frequent contact with us, ﬁrst of all, stay longer with us and also have a higher Net
Promoter Score. So, I think we do see that there is a good correlation between the Net
Promoter Score and the retention. But the one-to-one relation, I guess we haven't really
found yet, so to speak.

A - Morten Hübbe
And I guess it's fair to say, Jonny, that we're not gambling on an increase of retention rate
to save the day on the cost ratio. We're planning to deliver the cost ratio regardless. But
as Christian says, it just means that we are working a lot harder than planned, but it
doesn't change our commitment to reaching the 14%.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. And the second question was just, over the last couple of quarters, you
guys have spoken a bit more about improving claims management processes and
tightening up processes around home claims and burst pipes in houses in particular. I just
wondered if there's any more progress there, any more updates you could give us?

A - Morten Hübbe
Well, actually it's something that we're spending a lot of time on. I've actually personally
been visiting a couple of the dedicated teams that works with, for instance, pipes. And
clearly, the evidence that they can lower the price of the claim without disturbing the
customer is very evident because we've increased the level of education. They're
becoming pipe experts and not insurance people. But actually, that's what you need to do
because, otherwise, the supplier of the repair will overcharge and he will do repair that is
not necessary.
And we can see examples of reductions of 20%, 30% of the repair costs when they
actually get close enough to understanding the details of that claim. And I think, to be
honest, it has shown us that there's probably more areas where we will invest more in
specializing on complicated claims. So, I think we're seeing clearer and clearer that a big
part of the claims will be more automatic and will have more online and more systematic

survey of fraud risk behavioral pattern, the plausibility of the claim, et cetera, that will be
one part.
And then we'll have another part where we invest more in specializing and understanding
the complicated claims. And the pipes, as an example, is progressing really well, and they
are saving a lot of money in the process. We just need to make sure that the money we
invest and the claims we reduce that there's always a good trade-oﬀ and business case in
that. But it's progressing really well.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. Thank you very much. Just one thing. You mentioned now the Danish
motor market where last quarter we were discussing how technology is increasing some
severity in claims and now you're highlighting also the frequency. Now, do you – I mean, is
it your hope that we can start seeing some price increases in this line? Because so far, the
focus of price increases, as far as I understand, is mostly homeowners and travel, but not
really motor, also because motor is proﬁtable already. So, if you just comment on what
you are really hoping to achieve in this balance of high proﬁt business the frequency
picking up.
Then on the – just two points of clariﬁcation, please. Christian, sorry, you did say you don't
want to focus on the mid-sized claims, but the reason I ask a little bit about that is because
recently or last two years, you, yourself, Tryg has mentioned that some bits of claims
inﬂation sort of got ignored. And I'm just wondering if in your mind there's any risk that
some of the recent FTE compressions or other initiatives might have led to these midsized claims being ignored or maybe it's just not a trend and one-oﬀ (38:51). I just want to
know your view.
And a very last quick one from me is just a clariﬁcation that the high run-oﬀ in Corporate
rather (39:03) in Norway mostly, is coming from workers' comp, if you could just remind
us then? That's just my understanding. We just want to understand that. Thank you very
much.

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

Okay. Vinit, good morning to you. On the motor side, I think we're actually – in our
conversion of the motor products, we are also increasing our prices here. So we're
actually – and you know that you can kind of hint a little bit of a price increase when you
look on our average prices in motor in Denmark, but also in Norway we are increasing the
prices.

FINAL

So it's not true that we're not doing anything on the pricing side. I think it's important that
the market understands that there's a trend here, whereas we, many years, have been
talking about really, really proﬁtable business. I think if we're not aware of the early signals
of maybe some deterioration here, we're going to end up having a non-proﬁtable
business and nobody wants that.
So we are doing price initiatives both in Denmark and in Norway. And when we talk about
both the technology, last quarter, it was more of having a balanced talk about the MTPL
versus the casco claims. And I think actually it was Per Grønborg who last time
commented on the frequency increasing from Forsikring & Pension like this public
information. So we thought that would be great to also bring that forth a little bit more
broadly and talking about the increase in claims.
On the mid-sized claims, I do want to reiterate that a lot of this is more stochastic variance.
I do not believe that any of these are due to reduction in FTEs either on the underwriting
side or on the claims handling side. This is more or less stochastic variance, I would say.
But you're deﬁnitely right that when you do compress the FTE side, it's very important to
make sure that our claims handling and our underwriting is still intact and in line. And I
think we have seen, especially with the sewer team where we might have – I think we
mentioned that we had some of the claims adjustment oﬀ – outsourced and that was
probably clearly a bad choice because that increased our average claims. And that is also
what we have been taking back and in-sourced that loss adjustment. The Norwegian...

A - Morten Hübbe
(41:13) that we have other parts similar to the pipes and sewerage part. I mean, we've seen
– so we're doing lots of detailed studies of where is there an underlying claims trend that
we can capture better. And just to give you an example, we've put up a specialized team
to work with the – when jewelry is stolen, how is the value of that assessed and how is it
replaced.
It sounds like a small area but actually, we've seen that the trend there has been negative.
After we've now put in place a specialized team and new tools, the claims of that is being
reduced and the customer satisfaction is increasing while the claim is being reduced. So
there are lots of small pockets where we can improve the specialization, but that's not, as
Christian says, the stochastics of the property claims in mid-size, that's not the same issue.

FINAL

On the Norwegian run-oﬀ, I think that we have seen that workers' comp in Norway has
had a very underlying trend improvement in the risk, which is why we're seeing that
there's more room for taking run-oﬀ in that part of the business. I think also our
colleagues in the Norwegian market has mentioned that there has been positive
improvements on the reserving side from their point of view, and also it would increase
their run-oﬀs. So it's very much in line with the rest of the market expectation on the
Norwegian side.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Could this be linked to the oil price move recently, do you think, or not really?

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

I actually think there was – but this is four or ﬁve years ago when the Norwegian
government actually put in place some regulatories on the working force and then better
rules on work safety and getting back to work. So it's much more what happened four
years, ﬁve years ago that we are seeing the improvement and it's that part of the portfolio
where we're seeing run-oﬀ gains from. It's not the 2015 or 2016 portfolio, it's more the
older years that we're seeing the improvements from.

Q - Per Grønborg
Hello. I assume it's me. It's Per Grønborg from SEB. Is that correct? Untrue?

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

Sounds right.

Q - Per Grønborg
That sounds right. Perfect. Thank you. Okay. Thank you, guys. Just two questions from me,
both related to the investment part. Your match portfolio has performed quite nicely. You
have now reported the performance based on regulatory deviation and performance
deviation for three quarters in a row. The performance have delivered more than DKK 50
million per quarter on average. Are there any reasons why we should expect the match
portfolio to be slower (44:04) going forward or doesn't this just show that your PMs, they
are able to make a quite consistent outperformers? Is that a too optimistic view?
The second question is more nitty-gritty, the other items minus DKK 95 million this
quarter; (44:20) should we still look for a run rate in the magnitude of DKK 200 million

going forward?

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

I didn't catch your last question. Per, can you repeat that sorry?

FINAL

Q - Per Grønborg
The other ﬁnancial items, the hedging cost, you said it was minus DKK 95 million this
quarter, clearly above the run rate you have guided on previously. Any reason to see the
run rate being diﬀerent from minus DKK 200 million going forward?

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

Well, let's start with your last question. I don't believe that there's any reason to see things
diﬀerent going forward. So that will kind of clear up the last one.
With respect to our PMs and whether they are better at outperforming than the zero
(45:02) that we are guiding, I think that if you take more quarters into consideration, we
have seen the performance also being negative, but we clearly have some really
intelligent and good people there. But expecting them to also be able to outperform the
next coming quarters would be probably a little on the optimistic side. But we are
deﬁnitely happy that they are currently outperforming the market.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hübbe
If you assume that, Per, that would be your choice and not our recommendation. We
wouldn't assume that.

Q - Per Grønborg
When I look at the guidance you gave at the beginning of the year, when you turned to
the Solvency II discounting curve, the general message was that it will be harder to match
it going forward. And I'm just looking at the numbers and looking at the performance
component, it's quite consistently positive. Then, you have the regulatory deviation,
which, of course, is swinging up and down with the spreads, that's basically what I've
been looking at. But it seems like your message is that you are happy with the
performance you've seen, but you don't guarantee the same performance going forward,
is that correctly understood?

A - Morten Hübbe
That is completely correct.

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

I think you concluded very well.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Iain Pearce from Berenberg. Please

Q - Iain Pearce

{BIO 19522835 <GO>}

Morning, all. Just a couple of questions from me. On the claims inﬂation side, I'm just
trying to understand the price moves that you did or putting through at the moment, how
much of that was in relation to claims inﬂation that you saw in 2015?
And basically in terms of going forward if you continue to see claims inﬂation running as it
is in 2015 (46:41), does that mean you have to move again on pricing either at the back
end of this year or into 2017?
And then, just on the expense ratio side of things, in the Corporate segment, you
mentioned that your expense ratio there is too high. I was wondering if you've got target
for what do you think you should get that down to and is there a ratio target in terms of
the overall cost-cutting plan for that segment? Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

All right. Good questions. Let's start with the claim inﬂation. I think you're absolutely right
that the claims – the price initiatives we did in the ﬁrst quarter of 2016 was deﬁnitely
because we had not put enough price increases through the portfolio in 2015. So there
was somewhat of a catch up there and we've put through about 3% overall on the book of
price increases.
I think we'll also continue having price increases into 2017. I think inﬂation and price
increases need to go hand in hand. So we have also planned to have price increases in
2017. I think we'll come back next quarter to detail more about what we expected actually
in 2017 on the price increases like we guided to 3% in 2016.

A - Morten Hübbe
And I guess it's fair to say Christian on that that we are trying to get closer and closer to a
much more gradual process of price changes because what we've realized in the autumn
of 2015 was that claims inﬂation had been slightly higher than planned and also that our
speed of gradual price changes have perhaps not been strong enough.
And then, there were speciﬁc claim initiatives where we needed to improve. So we're
trying to become cleverer and cleverer of a more gradual price change and not just the
catch-up impact of once and then we fall asleep again. So this is really an attempt to get
into a new, much more gradual methodology.

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

With respect to your last question, I don't believe that we have commented on the
expense ratio in the Corporate segment being too high.

FINAL

A - Morten Hübbe
I think the most structural comment was made is probably that that clearly Private lines
Denmark has been moving along really well when it comes to cost and there's been a
period where we felt the need to do more cost initiatives in Norway and that's why we are
quite pleased this quarter to see that Commercial Norway, but also Private lines Norway
are doing a large number of operational changes to reduce head count, which doesn't
help their numbers currently, but you will see it in their numbers in 2017.

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

And I think you have to bear in mind that when we talk about an expense ratio here, we
have half of our business is non-brokered. And I think if you were to look at only brokered
business and compares to other companies that do broker only business, yes, our cost
ratio would be much less than that. But there you actually have an expense to the brokers
that is not really shown as an expense ratio. And in our direct business, you have a higher
amount of administration cost to service the customers and clients and make sure they
get a good treatment. So, I think you need to make sure if you compare us to other
colleagues in the market on the expense ratio side that you compare apples to apples.
