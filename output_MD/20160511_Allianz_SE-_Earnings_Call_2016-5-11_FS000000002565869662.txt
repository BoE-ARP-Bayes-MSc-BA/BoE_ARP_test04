MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Allianz Conference Call on the Financial Results
for the First Quarter 2016. For your information, this conference is being recorded.
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to your host for today, Mr. Oliver Schmidt,
Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.

Oliver Schmidt

{BIO 2473131 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you, Maria. Good afternoon from my side as well and welcome to our
conference call about the results of the ﬁrst quarter 2016. I think I can keep it brief. We
have published key numbers already last week and you have seen our analyst
presentation this morning, so all the details you will now get from Dieter.

FINAL

Thanks very much, Oliver, and also warm welcome and good afternoon from my side. I
used presentation as published on our website this morning. So, I will start with our new
strategic introductionary (01:05) chart based on all the targets we have set in our renewal
agenda. Of course, one quarter compared to a 12-quarter target is not meaningful in all
categories, but I will highlight the points.
Clearly, with a high net income, we will talk later about the EPS growth had a wonderful
start into this 12-quarter average period. I would, from the 32 knots (01:39) conclude that
we will beat our 5% target in 2018 by a huge margin. But I would say we are well on track
and stay ahead of the 5% target. The RoE, similar eﬀect – Q1 eﬀect.
P&C combined ratio, we still have a gap to reaching the ﬂat 94%. I will talk about it with
the P&C segment. Our Life & Health OEs with a return on equity above 10%. We have a
big shift in the participants here compared to year-end. The stable one is our German life
business which ended the year with 25% RoE and started the year with 25% RoE where
the other are really moving in and out the U.S. What's in that year-end is now out. France
was not in, but it is now in and Italy moved out, Benelux moved in, and our German health
business moved out because we had a fairly large booking on increasing risk reserves for
the health book which will normalize over the quarters.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, you see still a lot of volatility with the two disclosed transactions on Korea and Taiwan,
which are not yet in the numbers because the transactions are not closed. But with the
closing of the two transactions, certainly these are two countries which can permanently
move out of the category below 10%.
New business margin, I will talk about later. Interest rate sensitivity down 2 points
compared to year-end and on the right track. And on PIMCO, I will, on the cost-income
ratio, I will also talk later about, and the other measurements are actually not done on a
quarterly basis. So, here we just put less in our year-end numbers. So there are probably
more at memoriam and not giving a quarter view.
So, let's move now to the usual numbers. Revenue's down 6%, of which a good 1% is FX.
Life is the driver for the reduction and it is our one-third reduction in Life because we sell
Life not for volume but for value, and we are up on new business value, and that is how
we drive it. And also, on the risk consumption of the new business, we are moving in the
right direction. Later, you'll get more P&C plus close to 3% and asset management
double-digits down in revenues. We'll talk about it when we look at the asset
management numbers.
Operating proﬁt, overall, I must say I feel was close to €2.8 billion. We are repeating the
strong start of the year from last year. And personally, I like this year's ﬁrst quarter results
more than last year's ﬁrst quarter results, and I tell you why because our Life business last
year had in Q1 a lot of one-oﬀ eﬀects from high realized gains. We did last year a lot of
changes in our asset portfolio in the Life segment in last year's run for the low-yield
environment.

FINAL

So, therefore, there was a lot of realization in it which did not repeat this year, and this
year we booked also another €82 million loss recognition operationally in our Korean unit
because also in Korea the 10-year interest rates almost dropped 50 basis points in Q1,
parallel to other currencies. And therefore, I think the quality of the result is really good.
Asset management is following the outﬂows, in particular on the retail space over the
previous quarters, we see €90 million less operating proﬁt.
In the corporate segment, well, has another eﬀect from our internal pension. I actually put
it in writing already a year ago in our explanation for Q1 that there is a high chance that it
repeats in this year, and I can repeat the statement and say and there is a high chance that
it repeats again next year. And then we have a positive eﬀect here from some Korean
interest rate hedging, which explains the plus €27 million. So, overall, I think that's a really
good number, pretty much same level as the good start last year.

Bloomberg Transcript

And then let's move to the next page, page seven and I'll be approaching the probably
this big topic of capital and solvency. Sure, low-yield environment is the best friend for
ﬁxed income asset prices, so shareholders' equity had a new record with €67 billion.
However, how is the economic picture for it? And that is the Solvency II capitalization,
which is down 11 points on market movement and 4 points opening adjustment on the
change the German regulator has done on the tax treatment in our Life company. That is a
little bit of a complicated story as everything in Solvency II.
But also I have to apologize that I did not watch out more in February that this could have
an impact because it is a treatment of the unassigned policyholders' surplus, which is a
pre-tax ﬁgure in German local statutory accounting and was also pre-tax ﬁgure in all our
models. So, the regulator said, no, in your model, you have to use it as a post-tax ﬁgure,
and the tax is still unpaid, that means it is still a tax buﬀer in the local entity.
With this change actually (08:52) pretty late in February, the consequence is that, actually,
the local solvency ratio of our German life business went up because it gave more
ﬂexibility of this tax buﬀer in the overall modeling. However, the transferability of AFR
from the Life unit to the group changed in the aggregation formula, and the group is
losing 4 points, although we have still the money available and OE solvencies are all
higher than before.
And that is not a decision on Allianz model. That is a decision for all German life
companies. Whether you use standard model or internal model, it is still all the same. So,
it is nothing special for us. But also, I must say, I was a bit surprised that something, which
was in each entity positive ends up as a negative group eﬀect, I had also to swallow when
I understood the calculations.
So, now moving – the sensitivities, I don't need to explain. I think they are all easy to read.
Let's move to the next page and explain more what happened operationally with our
Solvency II number during the quarter. Let's start with the upper half of the chart, which
shows the development of the AFR, the own funds. We have created a waterfall chart
actually mimicking the prior MCEV development, so splitting between operational
developments, market developments, and special eﬀects.

FINAL

So, the ﬁrst minus €1.7 billion is the tax treatment I have just mentioned so that are the 4
points we lost over midnight January 1. The second part of the waterfall are the operating
earnings of the business in the quarter under Solvency II assumptions. So, the €2 billion in
Life is probably the number sticking out. The other numbers, Asset Management, P&C,
and also Corporate segment are in the end pretty close to the IFRS operating earnings
that is there are only small economic variation like the reserve discounting in P&C, which
has tiny eﬀects and you can qualitatively forget these diﬀerences.
So why is it €2 billion in Life? There is – and please note these are pre-tax numbers here;
otherwise, I couldn't compare it with operating proﬁt. So, that means in Life, we have a
normal expected business contribution of around €900 million. We have another €600
million coming from operating variance, no assumption changes. And the last point is a
good €0.5 billion of value of new business pre-tax.

Bloomberg Transcript

And as we have aligned our value of new business calculation fully with the Solvency II
rules, so you can take €1 for €1 our disclosed new business values, cost it up (12:38) for
taxes, and you can add it here in the operating earnings. So, I hope that this, in the long
run, makes the numbers easier to understand.
So, the next column is the market impact, €5.8 billion down. You will say, well, that is a
huge number and much more than we would have expected from your disclosed
sensitivities. But please, there are two eﬀects why the number looks bigger than it really is.
First, it's a pre-tax number. So, take out some 30% taxes. You can compare it more easily
with the disclosed sensitivities. And the second point is as we wanted to bring it as close
to the MCEV, we have actually also calculated the market impact on our U.S. Life business,
which is actually under equivalence, does not have a market impact. And you would see
the counter position under other. So, therefore, here's this 5.8%. It's probably too big to
estimate the impact on our Solvency II ratio.
Then, we accrue for the dividend and with €2.2 billion of net income and the 50% rule,
you'll start in the ﬁrst quarter with a big number, €1.1 billion dividend accrual, so that it's
actually a good 3% of our solvency ratio and particularly important when you compare it
to our peers who are not accrued during the year for quarterly dividends. And then, other,
as I just explained, it's a correction for taxes and equivalents.
So, then, in the SCR, there it is much simpler. I focused just on market impact. That is just
swap rates, 50 basis points down in Euroland and also most Asian currencies, equity
down 7% and credit spread, no movement then you get to the numbers here.
Management actions, we have actually reduced the impact by €1.3 billion, so you can also
say when you're all wondered in Solvency II numbers, we had roughly 18 points
movement from the market overall, also matching our disclosed sensitivities and we
compensated roughly 8 points.
So, that is what you can see. And with this one, I would then move to the next one. And
please note, both transaction, Korea and Taiwan, are still included as ongoing concern
businesses in our Solvency II calculation. We only take them out when the transactions are
closed. And I'm expecting at the moment a positive impact from those transactions.

FINAL

So, after so much explanation to Solvency II, let's take to the Solvency II training. Page 11 is
a page we have stolen from an EIOPA training program they gave in London one or two
months ago. So, you'll ﬁnd it also on the EIOPA website if you want to compare the details
yourself. So, this is a standard euro valuation curve for every undertaking using Solvency II
in Euroland. It has nothing to do with Allianz. It has nothing to do with internal models. It
is the valuation curve.
And the valuation curve is built up out of one-year forward rate and then translated into
the spot rate. When you start the ﬁrst 20 years, the light green is the spot rate which you
could also calculate backwards by using the one-year forward rates and then you
progress year-after-year. So, the blue line is then an artiﬁcial spot rate created out of the
observed ﬁrst 20 years. And then using progressively on a year-by-year basis as a oneyear forward rate, the 4.2%. And the formulas down there explain in detail how it is being
calculated. But it clearly shows that even in year 60, we are at undertakings using
Solvency II far away from using 4.2% as a discounting rate.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, then there is the whole debate about what happens when the UFR is being reduced.
We have disclosed on the comment page what is the impact for Allianz now. The proposal
of EIOPA is twofold. On one hand, they feel the 3.7% would be more justiﬁed. And then
they suggest, but in a year, the movement should not be more than 20 basis points.
So, if we would allow for the 50 basis point reduction of the UFR, that would cost us 5
percentage points in our Solvency II ratio, and that 5 percentage points would be
according to the EIOPA proposal then being achieved somewhere in 2019. So, that is the
EIOPA proposal. Personally, I think that the 4.2% is still the justiﬁed rate, and the political
debate will then go backward and forward between the EIOPA proposal and the existing
4.2%. Why do I feel that the 4.2% is justiﬁed? Because it is the 2% inﬂation assumption set
by (19:15).
And secondly, we feel that when you look long term, the long-term real rate is 2.2%,
EIOPA has now reduced the period they are looking at. Therefore, they came to this
calculation, 50 basis points lower, and certainly on a 60-year outlook, you can have a lot
of arguments what is the right number. Actually, I recently saw it start from the Bank of
England interest rates showing the last three centuries. And then probably the good 2% is
the better long-term real rate.
Okay. So, now, enough of Solvency II. Let's go back to our quarterly results. P&C, pretty
pleased with the volume growth, the 2.7% internal growth, 1% price. 2% is actually volume
eﬀect. And probably you want to know how the price eﬀects, where they are coming from.
A very good start into the year by Germany, close to 2%; also France, good 1.5%; and then
in particular, important to mention, UK, strong 3.5%; and Spain, 5% price eﬀects. And
then, we had small negative in Italy and in the Global Corporate, so large corporate
business and also a little bit in credit insurance Australia was more or less ﬂat.
So, from this one, let's move to the results in P&C, page 15. Operating proﬁt, good €150
million up. And, actually, the biggest driver for the diﬀerence is the underwriting results,
and the underwriting results beneﬁted a lot from low catastrophe development. Actually,

FINAL

we had in the quarter some €20 million cat events. I'm not sure that you can call €20
million a cat event. So, it was cat-free in the quarter.
The accident year loss ratio worsened like-on-like maybe 50 basis points attritional (22:02)
over last year. There is on one hand more mid-sized losses where we had last year really
nothing. So, therefore, I would say it is normal quarterly volatility or as a interesting
anecdote, our AWP business, all our travel and assistance business had actually
worsening due to the Zika virus because we had a lot of travel cancellation, which visibly
increased in this ﬁeld, the loss ratio. So, it's not only happening in Brazil. You can also see
it in Munich.

Bloomberg Transcript

Under other, the plus €113 million, we had last year a big restructuring charge under this
line for Fireman's Fund. Certainly, that has not been repeated. That explains €90 million
diﬀerence and the other €20 million is actually good news because we are increasing our
fee income business, not only in our assistance business but, in particular, in AGCS and
(23:16). So, that is another €20 million of sustainable proﬁt.
Investments, substantially down, €100 million from last year. I come to it in the second
one-oﬀ results, uneventful, good contribution across the board, no negative. So, that
means no reserve strengthenings, in few areas some single-digit million amounts but that
is not relevant. And I would also like to mention here that we are actively managing our
run-oﬀ business with the deal with Enstar. We transferred €1.2 billion of long-term
liabilities, which in the past years always gave rise to increased reserves so that volatility is
out of the books. And then we have also sold our UK asbestosis business, which was
written many decades ago by AGF, and that transaction is going to close probably in Q2
and then we have another oﬄoad of long-tail liabilities, which helped actually to reduce
also the capital charges for the long-tail liabilities and will stabilize our run-oﬀ ratio which I
feel is anyway one of the strengths of our group.
So then going to the ﬂagship OEs, overall, I think excellent results. Now, our leader in
underwriting proﬁt by distance, Germany, strong 89% combined ratio but also beneﬁting
from a really, really pleasant winter. Not so for the skiers, but for everybody else and in
particular the insurers, so that was a good start into the year. Italy still a very strong
combined ratio even when we have to accept that in motor, the market is slightly going
worse.
And you can also see that in other areas, the business is really looking good. Allianz
Worldwide Partners, I explained already. On one hand, the Zika virus is driving the loss
ratio up. On the other hand, we had also in our Health business a worsening spot ratio. I
think all others look pretty good.
Australia, 101%; that is certainly not our 94% target. But please keep in mind that the ﬁrst
quarter in Australia is the quarter with high natural catastrophes. They call it as the autumn
season, so to speak. And we think that 101% is a good start into the year. Also visible that it
is 2% better than last year. And when it continues like this, then we end up also 2% better
for the full year.

And Latin America is not yet turning. Although in Brazil, the group Health business, which
was our most diﬃcult area, had a positive underwriting result, but motor business in the
market turned negative and then drove up further. And further, we had also more, I think,
a little bit of additional reserving and write-downs for our Argentinean business.

FINAL

Spain, clearly, the fantastic development in volume, strong combined ratio and the
surprise increases. That's really a very nice business to watch.
Interest income in P&C, page 19, I said already €100 million less. The big shift is actually in
net harvesting and other. We had last year in Q1 a positive impact from FX and this year a
negative, so the swing is €60 million. So, actually, as I'm also hoping that this is not
repeating another factor that the sustainable proﬁt should actually be a bit higher. And
then, I think the tables on current yield/ reinvestment you can read yourself. And then we
move to the Life bit.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let's start also with an update and, I believe, upgrade of our analyst presentation. A chart
which explains you I hope better what is really our Life strategy and how we are doing
there. We are splitting our new business into four categories. Guaranteed savings and
annuities is all the old stuﬀ, if you want to say so. These are the long-term guarantee
businesses.
Then comes the capital-eﬃcient products, these are what we call the hybrids. That
includes the ﬁxed index annuity business we sell, of course, mainly in the U.S., but also
very successfully in Germany. And then we have some special capital-eﬃcient products in
Germany. We're actually in retail in Germany itself. 89% of ﬁrst quarter new business
volume was in these category capital-eﬃcient products. That is a huge swing and a huge
achievement of our complex distribution channels and the management team here is
really doing a fantastic job to adjust to the low-yield environment.
Next category is unit-linked without guarantees so that is plain mutual funds, including a
rep into an insurance product. And then you have all the risk products in protect,
mortality, health, disability, et cetera. So, you can really see how it drives the volume mix,
but also what does it mean for the new business margin.
I believe we are pretty much on track to achieve our 3% new business margin. The
missing part is that actually protection and health was weaker than expected in the ﬁrst
quarter. And the weak part is coming from France, which you will also see in the country
ﬁgures of France, where we renewed our group health and disability protection business
and the market was too soft to get the price increases we wanted, and hence, we ended
up with a slightly – a negative new business margin on this book so there is more to ﬁght
for an improvement next year.
But the renewal of this book is almost all in Q1 so, therefore, the next three quarters will
not have this eﬀect. So, is this a relevant eﬀect? Yes. It cost us 40 basis points in the Q1
new business margin for the whole segment.

FINAL

And then, I think the right-hand side of the chart is for you go to read. You can, in
particular, see that the U.S. had a fantastic quarter. This is a ﬁxed index annuity business.
We sold €2.8 billion, a 20% increase over last year and actually also at a new business
margin, which was above 4%. So really a very good start into the year.
So, now, the operating proﬁt in Life. As I said in the beginning, the investment margin is
lower than last year because we did less on realized gains, but also the Korean impact is
booked partially here. We had, in the technical margin, a reduction in the proﬁt because
we had to strengthen reserves in the U.S. And also, as I mentioned already earlier, this
one-oﬀ addition in our German health business so also the sustainable number I would
see better than the €270 billion we show as a positive technical margin. I think that it
should be clearly above €300 million in a quarter. So, another point I have forgotten to
mention in the quality evaluation of the quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, then I would move on to new business value. Clearly, compared to last year, 37% up in
value of new business. So, all the eﬀorts to provide new business for value are really
paying oﬀ. And I believe that the interest rate development is pretty comparable Q1 2016
over Q1 2015. We dropped 50 basis points, that is seems to be the Q1 story. Let's see how
it works next year. Although I'm, this year, less optimistic that we will see a recovery of
interest rates over the summer as we saw it last year.
So, we have to make our 3% new business margin in this environment. When we use
quarter-end interest rates, the new business margin would drop some 50 basis points. So,
what is then my expectation for the second quarter? As I said, that 50 basis points will be
roughly compensated by the French group protection business. So, I would expect that in
the second quarter, we should be somewhere around the 2.5%. And as we have more
measurements and activities planned, I believe even in the low-yield environment, we can
make our 3% step-by-step over the next quarters.
So, as I mentioned already to highlight a few strong ﬁgures, Germany above 3% and I
believe we will see even here an uplift in new business margin over time. U.S. was 3.5%
probably at the maximum what they can do. In Italy, I would look for an improvement and
also in France. Asia Paciﬁc will certainly beneﬁt from the disposals. For example, Korea
had a new business margin of minus 0.6% in Q1. So, that looks to me all pretty much on
track in the direction we should go.
Page 27 is our usual due diligence page on can we still pay our guarantees and is any
guarantee a huge risk for us. I think in the meantime, you should get used to this chart.
And I can only conﬁrm that actually, we are still far ahead of our guarantees, and
therefore, we are in safe territory. The details I leave to you for reading, then we have
more time for the discussion.
Now coming to asset management. AuM slightly lower than year-end. Actually, two
drivers for it that is actually the dollar is weakening again and Allianz Global Investors
heavily invested into active equity suﬀered with the equity market. Otherwise, I think
actually PIMCO stand-alone and dollar showed a small plus in assets under management
between end of the year and end of the quarter. But as we are euro company and last

Page 8 of 27

FINAL

year beneﬁted from the dollar, so I'm not complaining that this quarter, the dollar went in
the other direction.
So that are the biggest points. We had inﬂows in Allianz Global Investors in Q1 of €1
billion. PIMCO continued with €10 billion outﬂows very much in the ﬁrst month of the
quarter, but still showing a level which is very comparable what you see with our asset
management peers in the industry in active ﬁxed income. The inﬂows are going to
surpass it. And I would still expect that PIMCO, as I said before, and very consistent the
second half of the year, we are looking for a positive inﬂow number in total.
However, with the outﬂows and, in particular, the cumulated outﬂows now over four
quarters compared to last year, it's no surprise that – I'm now on page 31, that the
revenues are dropping by 12%. Actually, when you look at PIMCO stand-alone, we are
more than – we are actually 15% down in revenues and Allianz Global Investors, well, 7%
decline in the stock markets translates roughly into 7% decline in fees.

Bloomberg Transcript

So that is not a surprise, but we have also done here one correction. You'll see the big
drop in the fee margin at Allianz Global Investors. We found that we have done for years
one (39:09) position of advisory fees, albeit shown as assets under management-related
as if we're not – we kept them for the P&L, but we are not showing them anymore in this
KPI here. So, actually, the drop-oﬀ number would be much smaller. I think out of this 3.6
basis points in drop you'd see here, it's about a good 2.5 basis points linked to this
change in accounting and 1 basis point is a mix change of underlying fund.
So, that's translates then into a proﬁt and loss statement of our asset management
business, dropping 16% in euros from €550 million to €460 million. Performance fees are
pretty much at the same level as last year. And the big drivers are volume and margin
where the compensating eﬀect you should have seen and the other, but then it is I think
consumed by other development. So, performance fee at PIMCO is all coming from this
closed-end fund we continue to pay back to the customers and we will see more of this
performance fees there. And performance fees of the ongoing funds, there was actually
not a lot to book in Q1.
And we continue to book the incentive plan for PIMCO and the expenses are also there.
There will be a recovery in the second half of the year, which would then also help the
cost income ratio.
And with this one, I come already to the end of the story. Corporate segment, similar
numbers as last year. Operating loss of just €74 million. And then, I would go for
operating proﬁt to net income. We had quite a large volume of realized gains in Q1, quite
a bit of it for the forward sales we did in April last year selling one of our strategic
holdings in China at a good market and the accounting was with the completion of the
transaction in February or March.
And then we sold also beginning of the year some equity held here at the center and also
some ﬁxed income to change the asset allocation to our own pension liabilities for the
German business, which we are having here at the holding company and that created in

FINAL

total €568 million proﬁt, where the part which came from equity that was €400 million
something as according to the normal tax rules, tax free, and that resulted nicely in a tax
rate of 24%.
But let me also pour some water into the wine. The transaction with Korea will close. We
are expecting roughly €350 million IFRS loss that would be then also non-operating item.
And unfortunately, as this is also a realized loss on shares, it is as tax-free as the gains were
in the ﬁrst quarter. Therefore, the €350 million will then ﬂow to pre-tax, post-tax through
our net income.
Even taking this into account, I think we had a very strong start for the year in our net
income, operating proﬁt and also in the business we are writing (43:51) for value in P&C
and Life, and hence, we keep our outlook unchanged. I think it would be too early to
move away from the outlook ﬁgure, but having said that, strong start into the year.
And now, I'm happy to listen to your questions.

Q&A
Operator

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you. We will now take our ﬁrst question from Peter Eliot from Kepler Cheuvreux.
Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you very much. I have three questions, please. The ﬁrst one was on slide 11. Thank
you, Dieter, very much for the (45:00). I guess you make this point yourself on the slide,
but it seems to me that the industry is currently getting quite a big beneﬁt from the shape
of the gray curve at 20 years. And it seems quite strange, but it's so sensitive to what
happens around sort of years 18, 19, 20.
So if the forward rate of 18, 19 years increases, then the valuation curve will fall and your
solvency ratio will fall. I'm not quite sure exactly how the extrapolation formula works, but
if you get 18, 19 years going up based on the curve sloping down, then it's quite easy to
see the sort of – the gray curve could be even sort of 200 basis points lower sort of
around sort of 25, 30 (45:48). So, I'm just – that seems very counterintuitive to me and I'm
just wondering if you agree with that and if you have a view on that.
Second one, much quicker. Just given the recent disposals, I was wondering if you could
give us an update on the current balance of your M&A budget.
And then the third one, inevitably, thank you very much for your disclosure on slide nine
in terms – inevitably, we always ask for more information and we get this useful stuﬀ. I just
wanted to check a couple of assumptions. I assume that the operating earnings numbers
are based on start-of-quarter assumptions and I assume that the new business

contribution is an all-in number, so there's no additional negative pressures anywhere
else from growing the business at all.

FINAL

And lastly, the €0.6 billion number you mentioned for operating assumption changes,
could you just say to what extent you consider that number to be repeatable? Thank you.
I'm sorry for the lengthy question.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you, Peter. So, next time, I only do the Solvency II chart and for that, let's skip.
So, on the swap curve, I'm not really following you because the valuation curve is the spot
rate. So, what we observed is the green line in the market. We have plotted the gray line
because these are the one-year forward rates. So you can, if you want, reconstruct the
green line by starting somewhere in year two and then, you do on a pro rata this one-year
forward rate to construct the spot rate. But the spot rate is in the end the spot rate and
whether the two curves absolutely follow the formula we have added to the base, I'm not
sure.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Yeah.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

But actually when I look at the gray curve, you can also say we have – yes, it's a very steep
and the years from 6 to – for 15 (47:59) but this dip between 14 and 20, you can also say
that it's not natural. So, actually our valuation and the spot rate is actually too low at the
moment and, actually, we see that we have a very artiﬁcial market on this one. So, you can
also make this point. I cannot conclude your conclusion.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Okay. Could I just quickly explain what I was meaning there? Because I take your points
completely, but my interpretation is that the blue part of the curve is basically calculated
from the green curve at 20 years and a combination with the green curve and the gray
curve. And the reason...

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

No, no, no, no. It's the green curve and then you add every year so one divided by 60 of
the 4.2%. That is the formula which is being shown here.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Okay. I guess I'll just follow-up oﬄine with the IR (49:06).

FINAL

Well, actually look at the valuation rate, 21. We have actually put the formula in how you
move from 20 to 21.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Yes. And the 2.2% in that formula is taken from the gray curve, and it's quite a bit higher
than the 20-year point because the curve is steep for 20 years. And so, it rises quite
sharply after 20 years because of the...

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Yeah, I think we stated oﬀ. Otherwise, we are doing the rest of the day this one here.
Disposals, I think we only update and publish M&A budget when the transactions are
closed. I'm not doing now rough, tough estimates. But with the numbers I have given you,
you can do your own roll forward (50:05).

Bloomberg Transcript

And the last one, the operating earnings, no. Again, it's no averaging eﬀect. It is because
we did not use any assumption changes. And of the operating variance, maybe €400
million special, €200 million is more normal. So that means if you want to normalize the
€2 billion assuming that the pre-tax new business value is unchanged, then we are
somewhere at €1.6 billion-plus for a quarter.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Good afternoon, Dieter. I also had three questions, please. Just starting – or turning to
slide nine. Thanks again for the reconciliation between the two ratios. I just wanted to sort
of check my understanding of this because, clearly, the operating Solvency II earnings are
ﬂatted somewhat.
But if you normalize for the good luck you had in the ﬁrst quarter and the operating
variance of the €600 million and then express that in relation that you annualize it and
expressed it in relation to the SCR, I think you get a view that the organic capital
generation in a normal expected year would be in the region of 20 points of Solvency II
generation. So, can you just conﬁrm that that number makes sense or if there's anything
else I should be thinking of? And, in particular, if you're able to give me an insight into
what the level of capital you have to put up against the life new business proﬁt under
Solvency II, I'd be very interested to understand that please.

FINAL

My second point is a little bit tricky, but I just wanted to understand the proﬁt signature
under IFRS from the U.S. and the Italian business in particular because, clearly, you've
been growing very strongly in both of those regions in Life and Health business and yet,
the operating proﬁt in Q1 in the U.S. and in Italy didn't really – they both fell. And I
understand the U.S. reﬂected the reserve increase of about €42 million.
But am I right in thinking that there is an element of proﬁt that's booked up front reﬂecting
the very strong growth? And that if new business proﬁt starts to decline, then there is
going to be headwinds on the Life and health earnings in U.S. and in Italy, i.e., there won't
be a ton of averaging impact from the assets under management. If new business falls,
then that will act as a big headwind from those two divisions.
And then, thirdly, just very quickly, I wonder if you could just comment on how you see
the M&A market evolving particularly in the kind of €5 billion to €10 billion sort of range in
terms of opportunities and ﬁnancial returns. Thank you.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. That's a very complex list of question. Okay, let me start with the Solvency II
generation. We show on the chart 9% pre-tax for the quarter, so that would be 6 points
after-tax. So, now, when you say okay 1 points to 1.5 points is coming from these one-oﬀ
operational gains, then you are more between 4.5% to 5% generation for the quarter
minus 3% go into the dividend, then you are net of, well, – and now we can argue, yeah, it
is maybe 10 points for the year net.
But important is that it is a positive number because that is not including any changes we
do via disposals and other capital management actions. And I think that is a very strong
message and I'm very happy that you are picking up on it, James, that we are generating
more solvency than we are consuming and we will certainly explore on these points more
into the future.
So, second question, operating proﬁt U.S. and Italy. In Italy, we trust didn't have the oneoﬀ performance fees we collected under the unit-linked business last year. The stock
market was not really strong. That is the biggest eﬀect on the Italian operating proﬁt,
therefore it declined. And then in the U.S., the reserve strengthening was, on an old block
of business, has nothing to do with our VA or ﬁxed index annuity business.
But also I have to say we had some negatives from the base risk in this very volatile stock
market in Q1 so the old VA block had some base risk losses, but that has nothing to do
with early booking and late booking. So, I feel that the ﬁxed index annuity business is a
very stable source of operating proﬁt and growing nicely with the volume of funds under
management.
The last point is the M&A market, €5 billion to €10 billion. Well, I haven't seen a lot of
these deals recently in the insurance space. It seems to be happening more outside the
insurance space so, therefore, I cannot say whether the pricing of this transaction is better
or worse. The data points are so rare that no conclusion is possible.

Okay. The last point is easy to answer. You probably got asked by my IR colleagues that
you should ask this question. So, I think that we are delivering already so many details and
certainly Q1 and Q3 are not any more accompanied by a ﬁnancial statement so, therefore,
these are lighter quarters.
But most of our peers have given up on this quarter completely, therefore with our analyst
presentation, we give you really a very comprehensive view plus the qualitative
explanation what has happened. And then you'll ﬁnd on our website an additional
spreadsheets where you can download a lot of additional details when you want to have
more details. And altogether, I believe that is a pretty good service to give enough data
points for the development of Allianz. And then in Q2 and Q4, you'll have then the
additional ﬁnancial statements.
The impact of the two Asian disposals is positive, but I'm not giving any numbers. Let's
ﬁrst close upon the action to the full calculation and then we know it. And the asset
management conﬁdence, it's reﬂecting the conﬁdence of the PIMCO management team
and I never – (59:15) it's one-on-one. They have some good ideas and plans how to move

We will now take our next question from Paul De'Ath from RBC. Please go ahead. Your
line is open.

FINAL

Q - Paul De'Ath
Yeah. Hi there, and just a couple of questions on the Life business from me. Firstly, on the
U.S. and the FIA business, can you remind me what's your view on the impact of the ﬁnal
DOL rule on that business? Because we think the ﬁxed index annuities got brought into
scope within that. So, does that change your view on the outlook for that business at all?
That's question one.
And then secondly was just on the change in product mix that you've been very
successful in doing in the Life business, particularly in Germany. I think you said a huge
proportion of new businesses going into capital-eﬃcient product now. Is there a higher
cost at the moment of marketing those new style products and changing distribution
costs, I guess, of that shift that further down the line, we might see fall away and,
therefore, the VNB margin actually increases more into the future because of lower
ongoing costs or is that not something that's really big enough to register? Thanks.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Thank you, Paul. The question with the DOL rule is not easy to answer. So, let me
oﬀer you actually two answers. First answer is there is still a review of this DOL rule before
it is truly ﬁnal, so the whole story about what is the ﬁnal rule is not yet over and was still
under discussion. It could happen that the ﬁxed index annuity business is dropping oﬀ
this list again because it came also in – at the last moment.
For us, ourselves, we see it actually even the current version of the rule as an opportunity
as we have proprietary channels which should help us to drive actually the volume. And
we feel that, overall, the ﬁxed index annuity market will not get smaller. It actually could
still grow with the current version of the DOL rule and we see ourselves not as
disadvantaged to participate in this market.
So, that is the two answers I can oﬀer you, very precise. In Germany, we don't have higher
costs included in this new business. However, you have a good point with your correction.
With already announced reduction of the guarantee rate for traditional products from 125
basis points o 90 basis points from January 1 onward is the suggestion of the German
treasury. So, with this one, we believe that actually the customer interest in this new
product continues to grow.
Actually, the traditional products with guarantees below 1% are probably even more
diﬃcult to sell. That means our own agents have no arguments that other competitors of
diﬀerent products, which are easier to explain to the customer and the independent
agents so all the ﬁnancial brokers are anyway selling our products very well, and that will
then continue to go in market share overall. For us, I think in Germany, our market
position is really an excellent one.

We will now take our next question from Thomas Seidl from Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Your line is open.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Thank you. Good afternoon. First question on capital management. Let's assume that for
the rest of the year you paid 186% because what you earned is basically consumed by
capital market. And you would have, let's say, €3 billion M&A budget left by end of the
year. Would you still feel comfortable paying this back to shareholders, which would result
in a 9% drop from €186 million to €177 million or would you like to be at a higher capital
level in order to execute this capital return to shareholders? That's the ﬁrst question.
Second question, asset management, the revenue margin is going down quarter-byquarter. 40.9 is now the level. Is this the new normal in a way or are we seeing further
reductions on this important metric?
And the third question in P&C, I think if I load it for normal and NatCat, you are more in
the range of 96% combined ratio versus the target 94%, especially expenses are now
trending in the wrong direction. So, what are the actions to get you to the 94%?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you, Thomas, for the questions. Capital management, we manage the
company in a range 180% to 200% as announced and explained at the Capital Market
Day in November. We think we have no reason to change any statements made at this
Capital Market Day also how we handle the M&A budget. Either it's M&A or we return it to
the markets. So, on asset management, in its current mix, the revenue margin of this
quarter is obviously the best starting point for the upcoming quarters.
Certainly, midterm, we have clearly to work on it and that will be considered as part of
future strategic plans of our two asset managers.
On the P&C ratio, I'm not fully agreeing with you. First of all, each quarter has a slightly
diﬀerent baseline. Our – usually, our full year run-oﬀ ratio is also better than the Q1 run-oﬀ
ratio. And, as I said, we had in the attritional loss ratio some volatility in Q1 which went in
the negative direction. So our – we had last year 94.5% (01:07:45). I feel that we are still
playing around this number as a combined ratio, but I said that is still a guess to the 94%.
So, with this part, I clearly agree with you, Thomas.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Okay. On the – maybe one follow-up (01:08:02). So, let's assume 185 (01:08:04) is the
number in Q4. Would you then be willing to go to 175 (01:08:08), assuming you return €3
billion to shareholders or is that violating the 180 to 200 tolerance (01:08:15)?

We will now take our next question from Farooq Hanif from Citigroup. Please go ahead.
Your line is open.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi there. Thank you very much. Just going back to couple of generation, going also back
to what James Thomas Seidl Shuck was saying earlier. In numerical terms, you're ending
up with a number in a post kind of business evolution increase in SEI. You're ending up
with something worth roughly about €7 billion a year. And that number is materially
bigger than your previous guidance on free cash ﬂow.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now, I know the free cash ﬂow is not necessarily the same thing as Solvency II capital
generation. But I was wondering if you could just reconcile the two, on which number you
would recommend we use when trying to work out how much cash you're generating
versus how much you're going to possibly be able to use going forward. So, just to
reconcile those – the €7 billion and the €5 billion that you talked about historically.
Also going to capital light products. When you look at the proﬁt under IFRS, as a
percentage of reserves, it's a very decent margin compared to the guaranteed product
(01:09:42). I guess not surprising. What is the sort of average capital consumption of that
business – is it a quarter, is it a ﬁfth of the guaranteed business? Just roughly.
And the last question on actually AWP. To what extent do you think does a bit of repetitive
casual continuation of poor combined ratio at that line because that's obviously been
high growth decent proﬁtability? Just wondering to what extent we should worry that a
reduction in possibility for more than a quarter? Thank you.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Let me start backwards, AWP. I don't think that it is a long-term deterioration but it might
be still in Q2. On the €7 billion number, well, there is still some variation. And I said €400
million is still a – was still a one-oﬀ, so therefore you get a bit lower than €7 billion. And
also please, this is a pre-tax number. When you want to make free cash ﬂow out of it,
usually the tax man wants its share. And therefore that is then maybe a bit going too far
out of the Life segment. But overall, I think we are in a good way to manage our Solvency
II ratio going forward and still can pay an attractive dividend.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Page 17 of 27



Company Name: Allianz SE

Date: 2016-05-11

May I just return on that actually. So, the €7 billion maybe I should have shared my back of
the envelope calculation. But I'm taking tax oﬀ of that number. It still seems to me to be
materially high than your guidance on cash ﬂow. But obviously, you don't recognize that.

FINAL

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Yes. But look, the guidance on cash ﬂow was the real cash ﬂow. Here, you have still a
Solvency II calculation generating surplus but whether you can distribute the surplus. Let's
take a company who is only doing unit links. You could use very stable at nice (01:12:19).
And if the company has not a lot of capital and has high new business costs, then there is
no cash to be distributed because no supermarket even in the UK will take value enforced
as a payment. And therefore you couldn't distribute the value enforced although it's
generated surplus.
So, therefore, to translate from surplus – Solvency II surplus generation to distributable
cash and plan to build (01:12:55) is still another step. And then we had the capital
consumption of the capital-light business that varies very much for each market. I can tell
you my favorite example is Germany. Our product Perspektive of which is one of our big,
big sellers in the German retail space has roughly 30% capital consumption, let's say, for
single premium of €100,000 compared to the traditional product which looks for the
customer at ﬁrst glance, but it's similar.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, therefore, in total maybe half of the capital consumption is a fair assumption, but that
will then show up over time in the business evolution number because the business
evolution number is a capital consumed by new business minus capital released by
maturing business.

businessman, you look at the last quarters as somewhere in between 94% ﬂat and 96%, so
with an average they're just below 95%. I think we are so far oﬀ from this target, and I

Hi good afternoon. I've got three questions please. First the reinvestment yields, (01:17:51)
Life and P&C unless you're looking sort of Q1-on-Q1, the gap between the actual
reinvestment yield and the economic reinvestment yield is widened. So I guess 10 points
last year in Life and Health is now 20, 30 points now being seen as 20 bps. I just wonder
whether that's a sign you're actually reaching for more or taking more risks, so you've
reach for yield in that business? Wonder if you could comment (01:18:16) how you see the
risk of reinvestments? First question.
Second question, looking at slide 21, where you've gone through the split of the new
business by product bucket. I think it's really helpful to disclose. I wonder what the
earnings in the capital would look like if you split on the similar basis.
And then just ﬁnally, in the work you've done in terms of reducing interest rate sensitivity
of the capital base. In what scope is the future length and the asset duration more? And
what have you been doing in Q2 subsequent to quarter end? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. Let me start with reinvestment yields. Well, the disclosure I actually – I
did not explain it during my presentation. What is under the economic reinvestment yield,
we have just included here the cost of hedging foreign currency exposure. So, it's mainly
FX hedging and therefore I would not believe in this that we are taking more risk because
this hedging we bring the risk back to the previous level. So, you can only say that we
have maybe taken more foreign currency ﬁxed income investments this year than last year
and therefore we have a bigger cost of hedging.
So, the new...

But it is probably decimals points, so tiny movements. The return on capital for the
individual buckets of new business, that is a bit similar to Farooq's question on the
consumption – capital consumption of our capital-eﬃcient business.
Yes, we have to work on this additional disclosure, how is it capital friendly? It has at least
disclosed on the previous page the operating proﬁts coming from these four buckets who
gave (01:20:50) capital returns by bucket. We have to think about it. It might have been an

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, thank you. Sorry, the ALM part. I think that certainly a helpful step in closing the ALM
gap over to Asian disposals. And as a right, we are continued to write longer assets. We
have the opportunity in the last almost ﬁve months or four-and-a-half months of the year
really to participate in sizable infrastructure debt placements of suﬃcient duration.
So, we certainly continue to write very long-dated bonds. Whether we should participate
as – I was being asked this morning by the journalists into the 55 year bond of Spain
which has been a bit late during the state here. I don't know. I'm not sure that we have 55
year long liabilities we want to match with these bonds. But that is a decision of our asset
management guys whether this year that you get enough margin out of this bond.

Q - Jon M. Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

So, just to ask a follow-up. On the Korea and the Taiwan disposal, I can see that that's a
perfectly sensible thing to do. Your ROE target for the life entities to get everything by to
10% by the end of the target period. That is a very volatile metric. I just wondered whether
there is actually underlying that is a more value-based metric. The actions you take today
is simply based more on economic capital absorption rather than non-GAAP equity. So, is
there actually an underlying metric as well as the ROE?

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Yes. That is, on one hand, true. But we will evaluate each of our entities whether they
exceed a sustainable 10% ROE number. What we can only disclose here in the numbers is
the actual number without any adjustments. But in our internal judgment when we look at
it, actually, we look for a sustainable 10% ROE number. And when we get our new
business mix (01:24:01) when we make our new business margin at 3% with smaller capital
consumption for our capital eﬃcient product plus the fact that probably everybody will,
over the years, also work on their expenses. I believe that we can create also more
sustainability in this number even if there are quarterly jumps bigger than forward on
realized gains and losses from investment.

We will now take our next question from Michael Haid from Commerzbank. Please go
ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Two questions. Can you shed a little bit more light
on the weather-related losses in the ﬁrst quarter? To my understanding, you expect
normalized 2.9% weather-related losses. Net capital is only 0.2%. How much was the
weather-related losses? And I understand that the deﬁnition of weather-related is
somewhat diﬃcult.
The second question, you mentioned a negative impact from German health on the
operating proﬁts. Can you say what it was and whether it is kind of one-oﬀ eﬀect in nature
or whether it could be recurring?

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

That was just a strengthening of loss reserves for health claims. That was a one-oﬀ eﬀect. I
must say it's probably even normalizing during the year. It is more a one-oﬀ for the
quarter. It is probably more a nil eﬀect for the year. So, it is more a timing issue than a real
(01:26:03).
Weather, well, actually that is – weather-related, usually, the ﬁrst quarter is below our
global cat budget. But the question always is what is cat and what is the weather. We
usually – actually not even calculating all weather losses because you have, well, slippery
streets. And even if you have thousands of accidents because of ice and snow, you will
never summarize it to a cat event even if it was very costly for us. A cat event is something,
which gets a number as an event and potentially ends up at being paid by the reinsurer.
So that is the simple deﬁnition of a cat event. We are collecting information to help fund
(01:27:08) together reimbursement of the reinsurer. But what is not reinsured, you never
ﬁle a cat event even if it was expensive. So, therefore, it is a bit diﬃcult to say what was
what.
In two cat events we just had €20 million in the year. And weather related I would say, we
had 1 percentage point of the loss ratio but, overall, what came from weather.
In the second quarter, certainly the industry will see more cat events. The Canadian
wildﬁre, which is still devastating Alberta is certainly creating a fairly sizeable insurance
event for the industry. We are not very big in Canada, so I don't think that it will hit Allianz
a lot, but it is a big industry event.

We will now take our next question from Nick Holmes from Société Générale. Please go
ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Hi, there. Thank you very much. Just two questions. Firstly, coming back to your shift
towards Capital Life products, I wonder, Dieter, whether you could say that the objective
here is growth or capital eﬃciency and capital return? And then second question on Asia.
You're accessing Korea and Taiwan; do you see investment opportunities elsewhere? And
if so, where would they be? Thank you very much.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Yeah. Nick, thank you for the questions. Well, actually, we believe that the capital-eﬃcient
products oﬀer both, growth and capital returns because the construction of the product
allows us actually to run more attractive investment portfolios for our customers. And
hence the long-term customer return is improved compared to a traditional product
where you harvest the ALM and the low-yield environment almost falls to end up in ﬁxed
income only.
So, therefore, we really see it as the right application for the industry, selling just a record
around unit links is not what an insurance company can focus on. Then you can – then, the
customer can go to an asset manager. Actually, we have a very good one and we can sell
our asset management mutual funds directly to the customer. So, it is not covering the
same need of the customer. Therefore, we are a strong believer that when the life
insurance industry wants to have a right to exist and to cover customer needs, you need
more than unit-linked. That is our philosophy.

I know that the philosophy is not fully shared by others, and I also admit that we have also
markets where we are relying still too much on unit-linked business, and I'm not against
unit-linked, but it is not good enough as a long-term strategy that is what I'm saying. And
we will, in these countries where we are currently too much dependent on unit-linked,
certainly introduce also our capital-eﬃcient products. And therefore, in our disclosure,
we're keeping it clearly separate from the unit-linked box because we see it as two longterm life insurance business, and opportunities for our industry and not just saving capital
and shifting the investment work to the customer. In Asia...

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Sorry.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Yes. We see in Asia...

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Sorry. A quick follow-up to your comment there. Do you think that, therefore, that the
growth prospects in life will actually be quite good from this shift to capital-light?

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Yes.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Deﬁnitely. Otherwise I – we should change our strategy immediately because the
company, which doesn't (01:32:18).

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

That's great. Thank you. I'm sorry. With Asia?

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

With Asia. Yeah. We are expanding our bank distribution in Asia in Southeast Asia in
particular. Korea was actually not anymore an Asian closed market. Korea is a matured
market. Therefore when you buy and invest in businesses in Asia for high growth, then
Korea is probably not the place value would start. And in Taiwan, we have not reduced
our new business capabilities at all.
We have sold a legacy book and we are not transferring any employee and our new
business machine is completely impact and will continue to go with the business. Taiwan
is a great place for gathering and accumulate assets. We are, I think, also on the asset
management side in combination between PIMCO and AGI. The largest foreign asset

management in the country with a very good market share and a very good cost
perspective. So, that's it's certainly a market we like a lot and otherwise, the Southeast
Asian places we are throwing our business. China is a longer discussion that with quality
now go beyond the time we have for the call.

FINAL

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

But would it be correct to say that you do see material investment opportunities in Asia?
This is a territory that you're looking at.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

I would say good investment opportunities work material in context of a group which
makes annual €12 billion revenue and €6 billion net income plus the word material is
always a big word.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

All right. It's already half past 3:00. So, I guess we have time for one last question, please,
if there's any.

Yes. We will now take our last question from Vinit Malhotra from Mediobanca. Please go
ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Many thanks. Thanks. I'll keep it really quick. Just in the P&C – so one on the P&C, please,
and then one on (01:35:03), all quick ones. P&C, the attritional improvement that we used
to talk about from the turnaround operations, that slide was sort of not here because of its
contract structure, if you could comment on that just a bit brieﬂy how the 94.5 goes to 94
(01:35:19) if they still are thinking on the operational side.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Vinit, you are really hard to understand. Some of your line is broken and breaking in.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Is this better?

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Yeah. Yeah. Maybe can you repeat your question? I couldn't get it.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

FINAL

Of course. Sorry. So, on the P&C, the 94.5 going towards 94 (01:35:39), so in the past,
there used to be a slide showing the three buckets of combined ratios. And there was a
focus also on the turnaround units. Is there still that kind of focus or it's just under the
quarterly compression of slides that we haven't seen?

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

You mean our chart with various categories? Yeah. So, we are still having the same focus
and nothing has changed there. We still drive our business the same way as before. I see
you all made a strong point for the additional appendix, which I really think we surely are
overloading you with information. So, it is an unchanged focus and the units which are on
the list above 112, you can see it easily, it's Brazil and Argentina still stick out there. And as
the main areas and at the moment, AWP is also moved above 100. So, we have to watch
out as some of you also observed that we have to see that it's getting back on track. That
are actually the main areas to focus on.
Okay. And then you had another question on Life.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Asset management.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Or asset management.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes. Sorry. On Life – or I think the asset management ﬁrst. So, on PIMCO, when we track
the monthly total return fund and the PIMCO income fund ﬂow data, for the quarter they
seemed to have netted out each other. And we keep reading about how various
strategies are still attracting money. Where is this €10 billion outlook coming from? And I
know it's a very good number and the trend is positive, but I'm just quite curious where
this is really coming from.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

I think that's mainly institutional who are attracting their strategies in the environment.
That has nothing to do with PIMCO's attitude. Your observation on that the two big ones
are netting out is fully correct.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Can I ask one more, please? The French Group life business, what's the motivation to
write when the market was weak and the pricing was not good? Was it just the growth you
wanted or?

A - Dieter Wemmer

FINAL

This is mainly a renewal of old business. Well, we are following here the (01:38:44) of new
and old. So, it's one year contract therefore they show up every year as new business. But
probably most are discussed, most of it (01:38:58) two decades. So, we keep our market
share in this market and I still believe we can also, in following years, to better rate the
customer and have the opportunity to price up this business otherwise you are right. We
should not continue all of these policies since we are not getting it to a pricing position
where we want to have it.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

All right. Thank you very much Dieter.

A - Oliver Schmidt

{BIO 2473131 <GO>}

goodbye for now and wish you all a very pleasant remaining afternoon. Bye.
