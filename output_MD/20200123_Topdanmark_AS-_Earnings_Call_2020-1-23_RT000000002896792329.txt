{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Good afternoon, everybody, and good morning to the USA. Thank you for joining us in
this conference call. With me is Lars Thykier, the CFO; and Steﬀen Heegaard, Group
Communications and IR Director. We are holding this conference because earlier today,
we published the annual results for 2019. And before we start with the questions, we will
just take a minute to give a brief explanation on unexpired risks as mentioned in the
report and also the result on illness & accident, we think that will beneﬁt the process. So I
will give the word to Lars, and he will explain. And afterwards, we will take questions. So
Lars, will you start?

Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

Thank you very much. If I could draw your attention to Slide number 4, which shows
schematic handling of the unexpired risk of future losses that is in this quarter results. I
think it is a wonderful invention by the International Accounting Standards Board. That
should make things easier for you to understand. Try to imagine the company that was
established long time ago. The premium -- this is an insurance company of course, this
insurance company has a premium of 100 every year, and it has claims of 105 every year.
Sometimes in the past, the CFO has put aside DKK 5 million to cover unexpired risk or
future losses.
Each and every year the company receives 100 in premiums and it pays out 105 in claims
meaning, that the technical result will be minus 5 and the claims ratio 105. This goes for
the ﬁrst year, I have it on the table here. That is time plus one. Claims ratio of 105, then
time plus two, claims ratio 105. And if we look at time plus three, again, we will receive

FINAL

100 in premiums from the customers and we will pay out 105 in claims. But the CFO has
realized that next year, the claims ratio will be worse claims will increase. And then he
must put aside the reserve for expected future losses. In this case, I've used 15 as
expected future losses. And this means that 15 of the premium is reserved or moved to
reserve from for future losses. And the premium is down to 85, while the claims stay at
105.
The technical result in time plus three is minus 20 and the claims ratio is 124. The premium
growth will be staggering minus 15%. And still the cash ﬂows are exactly the same as the
year before 100 in 105 out. In time plus four, the claims will be 120. The technical result will
be 20 -- or minus 20 as it should be. The claims ratio will be 120, as you would expect, but
there will be a huge growth of 18%, even though the paid premiums are the same every
year and so are the claims.
So when there is a change in expected claims and you have a product where -- which is
having combined ratio above 100, then this will range moves in the key ﬁgures, as you can
see here. T plus three that is like Topdanmark in 2019. Our premiums are lower than they
should be. Next year, they will be higher than they should be, and our claims ratio is
worse than to be this year, and while it will be normal next year.
If we look at Slide 7, I suppose?

Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes.

Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

You can see, how the actual ﬁgures are in Topdanmark in '19. Last year, we had DKK39
million in surplus in illness and accident. But 150 of these 39 million were run-oﬀ gains,
meaning that before run-oﬀ we had a loss of minus DKK 111 million on illness and accident.
We have claims that are DKK64 million higher than we had last year. And then we have to
make this artiﬁcial reserve for future loss of DKK 40 million. So premiums are reduced by
DKK 40 million. So DKK64 million more in claims and DKK40 million debt in premiums.
And then there are some changes in expenses and premiums and so on. And that means
that the total diﬀerence between '18 and '19 is actually DKK 183 million. You may ask what
happens next year. But as you could see from the model I showed you, we will have a
pretty huge premium increase. On the other hand the claims ratio will be right. So that
has -- it has had quite an impact on this account. And that's why we try to explain it. It's
not that I am very keen on explaining separate products, but now I've done it this time. I
hope you can use it for something.

Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Yes. We hope that helps a little on the questions coming. So we're now ready to answer
your questions. So operator, please ask them one at a time. And operator, can we have
the ﬁrst question, please?

Questions And Answers

FINAL

(Question And Answer)
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our ﬁrst question comes from the line of Jakob Brink
form Nordea. Please go ahead.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Three questions, please. The ﬁrst one on page -- what you just
discussed last, sorry for that. But the runoﬀ gains or the decline in runoﬀs from -- on Page
7 in the illness and accident result. Could you maybe just give us a bit more details on why
it's down so much this year? That was the ﬁrst question.

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Yes. Actually, we make provisions for each and every claims here. But at some point of
time, we were a bit concerned about the development in illness and accident. So we
chose to keep one -- or not to release one claims here is runoﬀ while we, in '18, had two
claims here that were ready. We have only one claim here in '19.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

So just to understand when -- if you do this, bridge on Page 7 into 2019, everything else
equal, it should be -- the runoﬀ of minus 96 would be zero?

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

No, not necessarily. We do our best to put aside reserves in the right size. And if we do it
exactly the same way and the risk doesn't change, in that case it'll be zero.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Okay. And just, I guess a follow-up on illness and accident is, we've talked about this
before, but is there any willingness in the industry to get this product repriced to get a
better balance?

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Yes. There is a willingness, but it is as if the cost also it, so to speak, doesn't work very well.
We hear Danica, they want to increase prices. We have PFA, they want to increase prices
and you hear Topdenmark, we want to increase prices. We need to increase prices. And
actually, I think that if we don't do it, we'll probably hear from the regulator.
It is our deﬁnite intention to be -- to look very keenly on pricing in accident in 2020, and
we have already put some initiatives to work. So we think that it should be possible to
keep the snowball, abase, so to speak.

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

FINAL

Well, you can see an indication of this, we are indicating a growth in regular premiums in
life for 2020 of zero -- around 0% after a growth of more than 14% in 2019. And this is an
indicator of that we are executing steps in order to produce better results on illness and
accident.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

You said before last, and I don't know if that was intentionally. But I think you said before
that if -- it sounded like this mechanics in your Page 6 only worked, if it was a deterioration
of the proﬁtability. So what if it's exactly an improvement, if you get through the prices?
Will the mechanics work diﬀerently then or the opposite way or...

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

It will reverse. So if we don't break down the combined ratio, that will be really....

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

It works the same way to a typical amount.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Great. And then ﬁnal question on the -- I have read what you write about the life
insurance guidance, but it's a pretty big drop in the guidance compared to what you had
a year ago. So maybe a few more words, if possible, would be nice. Thank you.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

Yes. In the ﬁrst place compared to '19, we expect a much, much lower return on
shareholder funds. We had a very good investment result in '19, and until the imvestment
result in '20 will -- it is very unlikely that it is being just as good. But I have had...

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

I meant also just from the initially one year ago, I think that was DKK230 million.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

Yes. So there are some diﬀerences. I'm just on my way. We -- in life, we use the samples
for setting. That is an industry wide or in general accepted asset or assumptions about
asset returns by everybody in the industry. We have to use this to apply with a codex And
that has been changed before Q4. So that has brought down the expected returns on all
asset classes. Expected income on mortgage bonds or government bonds has been
brought down from 1 percentage point a year to 0.3 percentage points. Property has been
brought down from, I think from 6.1% to 5.6%. Shares down to 5.5% and it was on. So we
simply have lower assumptions about what the income is going to be. We are talking
about a decrease of around DKK45 million just due to these assumptions. Then we have -yes, that's by far the most important part. But besides this, we have an expectation that
our new IT system would work from 1st of April. Unfortunately, we have had to make a lot
of manual handling of cases that the system should have been able to handle. And, this
Page 4 of 14



Company Name: Topdanmark AS
Company Ticker: TOP DC Equity
Date: 2020-01-23

means that we are spending more money on making the system work, and we're
spending more money on the employees that we expected to do last time. So the
expense result we're looking into -- in '20 will not be good.

FINAL

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

And then for 2021, we think actually this will turn, because both the expectation to the
system, and also that we can look into eﬃciency gains on a later stage, and that we think
that it'll be better in 2021 seeing on the cost side.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

So what level are we roughly looking at in '20 and '21?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

We don't guide for '21.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

You're welcome.

And the next question comes from the line of Per Grnborg from SEB. Please go ahead.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. I will continue where Jacob ended. The sales and admin result
minus DKK22 million in '19, plus DKK25 million additional loss in the next year, plus DKK17
million in one-oﬀ disappearing. This implies that sales happening will be in the magnitude
of the mid 60s. Is that correctly understood?

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Cost side, you mean, what was the question, sorry...

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

Could you repeat?

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Sales and admin results in lift was minus DKK22 million in '19, you're guiding for DKK25
million extra cost, and you're guiding for DKK17 million one-oﬀ positive disappearing. This
must imply that sales and admin mix must be in the mid-60s, right?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

Right.

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes. That's correct.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

And there are no comments on, what the beneﬁts will be for the new system? Will this
ever go to sale or will this consistently be a signiﬁcant drain on proﬁt?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

No, that is not the expectation. I think I have warned you again and again that in
connection with the implementation of the new system, we will probably have a kind of
trough in the income in life because the expenses are so big. It is expected that the life
system will improve eﬃciency substantially when it is (inaudible).

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Let me add, far better customer service and lower admin costs.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

But this should imply that over time we should expect sales and admin to go towards
zero. Is that a fair assumption?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

I will be sorry if we couldn't, over time get it positive.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Okay. Perfect. Then on the return on the investments belonging to the equity, you guide
for DKK130 million lower than it was last year. That must imply that we are somewhere in
the mid 50s. What is the equity base that you multiply the return that you -- despite that
you get from the association's assumptions? What size of...

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

2 point something, two point something.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

2-point-something billion?

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

Yes.

FINAL

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Okay. Perfect. Then one more on life. You addressed that -- you hope that you'll be able to
price up waste products. The natural question is, to what extent have you -- are you
locked into multi-year pricing with the contracts you have sold to brokers?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

That was -- when you -- he's running -- right on. This means that it will be diﬃcult and it'll
take time to make the impediments that we want to make. Of course, we have the
possibility to -- even though we have a contract that is multi-year, we can cancel it, but it'll
be unusual. So that will probably not happen. Any comment, Peter?

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

I think it's fair to say that, yes, it is -- you point at something that is a problem but it'll also
take into consideration that we -- our key segment is actually the small and medium-sized
businesses. So we don't have the same troubles as maybe some of our competitors in
terms of health care giving long contracts. So a bigger part of our portfolio, do not have
these kind of year-long contracts. But we, of course, also have this kind of -- in our
portfolio.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

One should expect, if you go to the brokers center, you try to charge materially higher risk
pricing. That must impact other part of the pricing, meaning the asset management fee.
One must assume that, that must be coming down. When I look at your asset
management company, we don't really see any trend in the income there, despite
volumes are materially up. Can you help us decompose, what's happening to the asset
management fee? I assume it's performance fees that is oﬀsetting the underlying organic
growth.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

In the ﬁrst place, I would like to stress that on the performance -- on asset management
fees, we are the cheapest company in the market. And it'll remain so. We don't see any
speciﬁc reason to reduce expenses or asset management fees further.
The asset management company lives from money that is created from other places in
group. And the asset management company has to pay for this. You could regard itas a
marketing contribution or whatever. But the asset management company has to pay life to
get access to the money that life generates.

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

That is part of the cost result in life.

Company Name: Topdanmark AS
Company Ticker: TOP DC Equity

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Okay. Okay. So basically, we should not expect asset management company's proﬁt to
grow in line with the assets generated in the life company?

FINAL

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

There will be some kind of distribution. The asset management company will probably
increase its bottom line as time goes by, but a major part of the gain will be seen in the
sales and expenses in life.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Okay, that's -- okay. Perfectly. One ﬁnal question. This unexpired risk we discussed on
Page 6, 7, what were -- this impact you had on 2019, how big of that impact was into the
fourth quarter?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

The fourth quarter...

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Was that -- was anything of this hitting the fourth quarter? Is this primarily explaining some
top-line issues going into next year?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

No. Actually, that complicates things further on. If you remember the discussions we had
last year.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Yes. I remember those, yes.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

There was a distribution of this unexpired risk over the year, which makes things
absolutely impossible to understand. And this means that the premiums we had in Q4 last
year was very low. So actually, there's positive impact on premiums of around two
percentage points in Q4.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

While there was a negative impact on claims of some -- around the same size.

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Page 8 of 14



Company Name: Topdanmark AS
Company Ticker: TOP DC Equity
Date: 2020-01-23

So I think, the 2 percentage points in premiums is in the report. It is stated that we have a
growth of 4.4 before taking care of these changes in unexpired risk.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

FINAL

So the...

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

So sorry, it is ﬁxed 4.4. But if we clean it for changes in unexpired risk, it goes down to 2.4.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

That's 2.4. And proﬁt would have basically been 2 percentage points on combined ratio
better in Q4 if you hadn't had this eﬀect?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

No.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Okay. That was not what you said.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

No, no. There are two eﬀects. There's a pretty negative eﬀect from the claims where we
have increased our expected losses and has a positive eﬀect for unexpired risk, which is
lower than it -- or the transfer from -- to unexpired risk is lower than it were last year.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

If I -- If we look at Q4 isolated to 2019, this has -- this eﬀect has -- there have been no eﬀect
from the expired risk hitting the proﬁt. Of course, you have improved your proﬁt yearover-year due to this unexpired risk thing. But it has no impact speciﬁcally on Q4 this
year?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

Oh, yes. That's around DKK40 million in extra premiums in Q4 from this change in future
losses.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Yes, but you, have not had -- you have DKK40 million that's premiums, that is hit in Q4,
and we talked about hit earnings in Q4. Is that correc?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

Compared to '18, they'll hit premiums and thereby, the claims ratio will be better and the
technical result will be better. The top line is DKK40 million higher.

(Operator Instructions). And the next question comes from the line of Martin Gregers Birk
from Carnegie. Please go ahead.

Q - Martin Gregers Birk

{BIO 19920552 <GO>}

Hey, thank you so much. A question here on premium growth going into next year.
Breaking it out on the quarter. I could imagine that the Nordea deal is going to be pretty
back-end loaded. Is that correct? So we should expect two quarters of sort of slow growth
and then growth sort of to pick up towards the end of the year?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

Some of it -- for example, we have some indexation starting at the beginning of the year,
that starts with some kind of growth in the beginning of the year, but that's true. Around
the year, it actually is picking up ﬁne. We have a good start. So we've seen a lot of leads.
So we have seen good progress on that, but it's true that it will -- the Nordea deal, of
course will be higher in the last part of the year. But just to say, the growth in the
beginning of the year will also be aﬀected by indexation.

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Until now, and that's the ﬁrst month, we have had a lot of returns, but there hasn't been

seems quite strong. Could you help break it down between how much of it came from

volume rates and also things like some new products? I think you launched a new
agriculture product. Has there been any impact?

FINAL

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

There has been an impact from the indexation of the worker's compensation. And then
we have actually had a very good growth, in general. The product you're talking about the
Crop Insurance that we were very happy with, unfortunately, the farmers were not, at least
not at the prices that we suppose we should have. So it hasn't sold very much yet.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

I would say that most of the growth is due to volume. So we've had a net income of
customers from most other companies in the -- both in the commercial area and in the
agricultural area.

Q - Derald Goh

{BIO 20775137 <GO>}

Great. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up. Going back to the underlying loss ratio, I
think you again ﬂagged some negative impact from motor this quarter. Could you give a
bit more color behind the underlying drivers?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

What we have seen during the last couple of years has been that the claims on third-party
liability concerning personal injury has fallen very steeply. And this has been suﬃcient to
cover the increase in -- what's it called? Motor comprehensive. But we see a negative
development in motor comprehensive and positive development in personal injury. What
has happened in Q4 is that we have put aside an extra reserve for third-party liability
concerning physical things, not personal injury, but the stuﬀ that our customers run their
cars into has been more expensive. That can be other cars or bicycles or whatever it is.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

So it's the same eﬀect. You can see that on the motor comprehensive, we're seeing that it
is getting more expensive to clear the repair of a car with all the sensors and technology.
The same goes with the liability side of the things. That also means that we are looking
into the pricing on the motor comprehensive on the north, we say more things side and
not the personal side next year.

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

You'll see a slight skew where we don't or we will reduce third-party liability to some
extent, and we will increase comprehensive .

And the next question comes from the line of Youdish Chicooree from Autonomous
Research. Please go ahead.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. I've just got one question, please. It's on your adverse
claims experience in private property. It seems that throughout the year, you've had
recurring issues around burst pipes et cetera. So I was wondering what actions are you
taking to address this adverse development, please? Thank you.

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

I'm not sure I got that. Could you repeat, please?

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Throughout the year, you've talked about adverse loss experience on property, namely
due to burst pipes. So I was wondering what actions you're taking? Because ﬁrstly, it
seems that you're raising prices still in line with the automatic indexation. So I was
wondering whether you were doing something out on the claims side to mitigate the
adverse experience of 2019.

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

We are looking on the selection of houses. There are some cohorts, obviously, where the
risk is bigger than other. But you should assess this in combination with the other
products the customer owns or has. If we get a customer who has a house, then he'll have
car insurances, two car insurances, could be and insurance of dog and children and other
content. And that means that the package as such is pretty proﬁtable actually. But you're
right, that if you look on house alone, then the insurances are not proﬁtable.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Okay, that's it. Thank you very much.

And the last question comes from the line of Mads Thinggaard from ABG. Please go
ahead.

Q - Mads Thinggaard

{BIO 15369662 <GO>}

Yes. Hi. This is Mads from ABG. Thank you for taking my questions. I have just -- the ﬁrst
one is just, if you could help a bit. Now you had some quarters with some upwards
pressure on claims before one-oﬀ weather, et cetera. And of course, you discussed some

of the components here. But going into 2020, do you have kind of a normal rate of
change we should expect quarterly? Do you have kind of a picture of this at this point?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

FINAL

We do have -- I mean, sorry, I'm afraid I didn't get the question, right. Please again.

Q - Mads Thinggaard

{BIO 15369662 <GO>}

Yes. Now we have had this upwards pressure on, I mean, what one could perhaps call
underlying claims or claims before one-oﬀs et cetera. And it's more -- do you expect more
pressure going to 2020 this quarter year-over-year? Can you kind of picture that now?

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

The answer is no. I think we are seeing some pressure at some places. But in general, I
don't expect to see any substantial increase in claims. You look a little positive. Do you
disagree?

Bloomberg Transcript

No, I don't disagree. And actually you can see that in our guidance for 2019 in the Q3
report for 2018, we guided a combined ratio of between 89% and 90%. And now we're
guiding for a combined ratio around 90%. But that is -- but you have to take into account
that the discounting since that has hurt the combined ratio by 1.6%. And therefore, you
can actually say that the underlying development is improving in our time. 1.19%, actually.

Q - Mads Thinggaard

{BIO 15369662 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

1.5 actually.

Q - Mads Thinggaard

{BIO 15369662 <GO>}

Thanks. And could you remind us a bit, what kind of initiatives are helping claims in 2020?

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Both procurement -- activities within procurement. Its activities were then present when
we mentioned motor comprehensive as -- maybe some price increases on that. So we
have something that is more statistical, whereas, yes, from month-to-month or quarter-toquarter, that's again we're unsure on. Maybe we'll not do anything about that. But in other
places we can see that. For example, some of the speciﬁc coverage is on a car insurance,
parking insurance and so on we can see that the claims ratio is not good, then we also
look into price increases on that.

FINAL

We are screening the portfolio all the time. And when we ﬁnd, which we do all the time, of
course, ﬁnd customers that we don't expect to be proﬁtable at the price having for the
time being, they will have an individual price raise.

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

And the same as we said before about illness and accidents, we will look into how we can
actually increase the result and make it better. So that's also with the underlying claims.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Okay. Okay. Thanks for that.

A - Peter Hermann

{BIO 20507411 <GO>}

Welcome.
