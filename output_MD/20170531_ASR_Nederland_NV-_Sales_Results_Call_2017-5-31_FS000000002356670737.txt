Very good. Michel, thanks very much. Good afternoon and good morning, everyone, on
the call. Very pleased to walk you through the ﬁrst quarter results of ASR in 2017. We have
provided you with a small presentation. I will walk you through that slide by slide with
some further comment and color and, of course, time for questions afterwards.
Let's start. As you are aware, we're only giving a trading update. Insurance is a long-term
business, (01:24) our long-term strategies. We believe, in the interim quarter, it's only
appropriate to give trading updates and fully audited ﬁgures and full numbers as per halfyear basis. The current quarter, however, trading was good. We have a very solid and
benign quarter behind us, strong ﬁnancial performance, and improvement in earnings
quality in the ﬁrst quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

Page 2 talks you through the key ﬁgures, an operating result in the ﬁrst quarter of €191
million. Operating result means a result before taxes, but also before capital gains and
before incidentals, up 38% versus the ﬁrst quarter of last year, corresponding to a very
attractive 17.3% operating ROE. Operating result, €191 million; operating return on equity,
17.3%, well above the targets that we set ourselves at IPO.
A Solvency II ratio, according to the standard formula, of 188%, down 1 percentage point
versus the end of last year, but please note that in that delta, we have absorbed a share
buyback in January as part of the government selldown of 2% and we allocated capital to
market risk, about 5 percentage points as well. So the delta in the Solvency assumes full
absorption of a 2 percentage point – a 2 ratio point share buyback and about a 5 ratio
points additional market risk allocation. If you adjust for that the underlying accretion, the
underlying growth in our Solvency was about 6 percentage points. So, that's, in a sense,
for us a very decent number.
This is a trading update, and the business was trading well as evidenced by our combined
ratio of 92.1% in our Non-life business, ahead of target, ahead of last year. So we believe
that the quality and quantity of earnings have further improved in the ﬁrst quarter.
Let me walk you through the details. Go to page number 3, talking to you about the
premium levels. In understanding the premium development versus last year, you have to
adjust for a few factors. One is, last year, we had the results with the premiums from NIVO.
We had a portfolio transfer of a funeral business called NIVO of €323 million. Those were
one-oﬀ transfer. That was in those numbers last year, so for comparison purposes, you
take it out. And this year, we have a slightly diﬀerent methodology of recognizing
premiums in Disability, especially premiums in the mandatory agents channel where we
changed the recognition of those premiums. That's a delta of about €50 million that one
has to actually – of estimated €50 million that one has to adjust for in comparing premium
to premiums.
If you look through those adjustments, you will ﬁnd that the Life premiums eﬀectively
stayed stable at €516 million and that our Non-life premiums went up from €841 million to
€884 million. So premiums increased about 2.9% (sic) [2.3%] compared to last year, mainly
in Property and Casualty. And premiums in Life eﬀectively stable.

On the cost side, page number 4, an increase in our cost base from €129 million to €137
million, 6.2% up. Couple of points to note, the increase in cost is, to one part, driven by
additional cost bases of acquired companies. Last year, we acquired SuperGarant, Corins
and BNG Asset Management. They were not in last year's cost base, are in this year's cost
base, so the acquired cost bases explained part of the cost increase. Some cost increase
are linked to the buildup of our Asset Management business, most notably the Dutch
Mobile (sic) [Mobility] Oﬃce Fund. Last year, we acquired the portfolio from the Dutch
[ph] Railways (05:36). This year, we went to the eﬀort of marketing and equity raising that
fund, and I'll talk a bit more about it during the page on asset allocation, but there is a
cost to launching and raising that fund.
Then ﬁnally, additional pension charges due to the fact that we have an annual pension
cost – the oﬃcial term is the current net service cost – that went up because of the interest
rate that was used last year. We ﬁxed the current net service cost at the end of last year at
a lower rate than the year before, which means that this year we have to deal with a higher
regular contribution to our pension obligations. That could be a temporary phenomenon.
If rates stay where they are this year, then in 2018, that increase will be reversed and the
current net service cost will decline again. So it's a function of ﬂuctuation in interest rates.

Bloomberg Transcript

The underlying cost development in the group was still – in fact is in line with our longterm cost reduction objectives. I'll give you a bit of color for what we're doing on the cost
side. In the ﬁrst quarter, we have started to consolidate the number of head oﬃce
functions, leading to the reduction of jobs in our head oﬃce by bundling together
services-oriented functions in head oﬃce. We're on the way and will go further in
integrating our P&C platforms.
Remember, we have a broker-based P&C platform, we have a travel and leisure insurance
platform, we have a direct insurance platform. And on the back end of those platforms,
we have started to integrate or will integrate further to further save costs. And ﬁnally, the
Life migration plans are still progressing according to plan. We have once more
completed a pretty challenging migration. So the 2018 completion timetable still looks
realistic.
And in funeral, we have commenced the integration of this NIVO book. We added the
portfolio last year, we ﬁrst ﬁnalized integration of AXENT and now we've commenced the
integration of the NIVO operations. So underlying cost – the operational cost
developments are in line with plans, and a number of additional initiatives have been
taken.
If you look at the operating result on page 5, we're pleased to report that all segments
witnessed an increase in operating result. Non-life, Life, also the smaller ones, Banking
and Asset Management, and Distribution, all went up for a operating result of €191 million.
This is a pretty safe and stable number. It is not a proﬁt before trouble (08:20) type of
metric. It's all included, excluding capital gains, excluding incidentals, but there were
hardly any incidentals during the quarter.

FINAL

We do not report an IFRS proﬁt number. We do not report a net proﬁt number during the
quarter. But if we have to produce one, think of a number around 180-ish mark for a net
proﬁt. So, again, a operating proﬁt number that, to our view, is stable and robust,
although there were some slight headwinds in the ﬁrst quarter that caused it to be very,
very attractive.
Those tailwinds bring me to our Non-life business, page number 6. In Non-life, the
operating result went up from €32 million to €54 million in this quarter compared to ﬁrst
quarter last year. Premiums went up. Most notably, we observed a premium increase –
underlying premium increase in P&C, about 6%, from €325 million to €345 million.
In Disability, the increase that you're seeing – that you're witnessing is, to some extent,
adjusted or aﬀected by the diﬀerent calculation – or recognition of our mandatory agent
premiums. If you adjust for that, the €50 million which is what we estimate to be the eﬀect
of the diﬀerent recognition pattern, there's a stable to slight decline in the Disability book
with the assumption of the (09:44) products. Last year, we announced that the
government would attempt to privatize part of the social security system. But the (09:55),
the government agency, is still active, and we've seen some of our clients moving back
into the public sector, which ultimately cost us some premium in the beginning of this
year. But we believe that in the long run, those clients will ﬂow back to the private sector
as the advantage of the government has eﬀectively run out in a couple of years' time.

Bloomberg Transcript

What we actually more (10:18) is the combined ratios as we steer our business on value of
a volume, on margins of a volume. In Disability, we were able to hold on or even improve
a tiny bit the very strong combined ratio at 91.2%, so continued to be strong.
Health combined ratio improved to 93.3%. There was a small beneﬁt from the Health
equalization system, about €7 million. Excluding that, the Health combined ratio would be
around the 96% mark, which I think is slightly more representative of the underlying
performance of the Health business.
And ﬁnally, in Property and Casualty, our combined ratio moved to 91.8%. There's an
internal competition between P&C and Disability, who will have the lowest combined
ratio? Well, the P&C guys are catching up. So, let's see what the next quarter brings us.
They're very pleased with the 91.8% combined ratio in Property and Casualty.
Now, honestly, we need to give a few (11:16) to this. In the ﬁrst quarter, everything that
went well or could have gone well actually went well. It was Murphy's Law (11:25). We had
no storms, no frost, no snow, and also no large (11:31) calamities, no large claims. Actually,
91.8% is actual number. We did book in 91.8%. But again, we have to be honest with
ourselves. We were just having a bit of tailwind as well. Had we had the normal set of
storms, the normal set of large claims, so the stuﬀ we budget for the underlying
combined ratio of P&C would have been around the 95% mark.
So, we're very pleased with the very strong quarter in Non-life. Operating proﬁt from €32
million up to €54 million. If you look at the underlying performance, I think that was
between €10 million and €15 million of additional results that we actually booked in Health
Page 4 of 20

Company Ticker: ASRNL NA Equity
Date: 2017-05-31

and in P&C that may have a one-oﬀ nature or may have temporary nature. At some point,
larger claims will kick in. But it's something we'll have to see during the year.

FINAL

For us, we look back at a very strong quarter with continued strong, uniquely strong
combined ratio in Disability, improving combined ratio in Health with some support from
the equalization system, a signiﬁcant improvement in the combined ratio of P&C, possibly
one of the better ones in the country with some tailwinds from the benign winter.
Overall, premiums increased as well. And we want to take note of the fact that P&C, our
volumes grew by 6% and the combined ratio improved to 91.8%. So, we see that's a very
healthy development in our Non-life business.
Moving on to Life, which takes us to page number 7, further improvement in performance.
Operating results, up from €121 million to €149 million. Premium levels down a bit because
of the fact that last year there was a one-oﬀ portfolio transfer that did not reoccur. If you
correct for that, premiums are actively stable, proﬁts up, and proﬁts up mostly from higher
investment results, both really direct results and increased contributions from the capital
gains reserve, a.k.a. shadow accounting capital gains release.

Bloomberg Transcript

The direct results from the investment portfolio were at group level across all businesses,
Life and Non-life, about €44 million increased direct results; €18 million (14:00) cash
income, coupons, dividends, what have you; €5 million reduced depreciation on
swaptions prices; an additional increase or – an increase in the capital gains reserve
release, €21 million.
So, as a group level, €44 million of increased direct investment income. Again, €18 million
direct yields, €5 million less depreciation on swaptions cost price, and €21 million increase
in capital gains reserve. The bulk of it is reﬂected in the Life insurance business, as most of
it are in Life.
So, our Life insurance proﬁt is up due to increased direct investment results, oﬀset to a
smaller extent by lower mortality results and lower cost results. On the mortality side, if
you remember, we have a signiﬁcant funeral book, and there was a wave of inﬂuenzas in
the ﬁrst quarter that causes increased amount of casualties and deaths, increasing our
funeral payout. So, a lower mortality cost Q1 this year versus Q1 last year due to the
increase in inﬂuenza observations in the ﬁrst quarter. And gradually, some pressure on the
cost result in our Life business as the business – the volumes gradually declined. We're
very pleased that the investment income, the direct cash investment income does indeed
held up and overcame any downward pressures on mortality results, giving us a very solid
handle to the Life insurance proﬁtability.
We did add some more capital market risks, as we said in our opening. Page 8 shows you
a bit more on that market risk developments. In January, we kicked oﬀ a review after our
annual strategic cash allocation. We're optimally using the capital base that we have, and
we initiated a small but not – but meaningful re-allocation of capital market risks.
Eﬀectively, what we did, we allocated more to equities, we allocated a bit more to real
estates, allocated more to mortgages and credits at the expense of governments. The
Page 5 of 20

FINAL

equity re-risking program is basically complete. We've done that. It has run its course. We
are where we want to be.
On real estate, last year, we acquired the oﬃce portfolio of the Dutch Railways. At that
point in time, there was – accounted for is a small overweight in real estate. The reallocation of capital now show it is actually the level of capital where we want it to be. So,
the overweight in real estate became the target rate in real estate. And we allocated more
to mortgage and credits, and more of its re-allocation is about 70% underway – the credit
re-allocation about 60%, 70% executed. So, that means we're nearly done on re-risking.
Some small activities still ﬂew over into the second quarter.
On the real estate portfolio, as you remember last year, we had €275 million of equity – of
real estate capital. That was within a fund on oﬃces. In January, we sold €60 million of
non-core assets. And during the ﬁrst half, we've been very busy signing up external
customers. And without giving undue information, I wouldn't be surprised if at the end of
the second quarter, we show you that we sold out on this fund as well because there
appears to be signiﬁcant interest from institutional investor to participate in this front.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, in summary, re-allocation of assets to more risky assets. On equities, €300 million
done. On real estate, last year's overweight is now our target rate, which will be reduced a
bit if new customers sign up. Mortgage and credit is about 60%, 70% underway in
achieving our target rate.
And to pre-empt one of your questions, how did French government bonds feature into
your Solvency? We did have a portfolio of small government bonds, about €1.1 billion in
OATs, but they tend to be smaller short-duration French government bonds. So, the
spread widening and run-up to the French elections had a very small impact on our
valuations and a very small impact on our Solvency. So, we were not concerned about it at
all.
Also, we continued or we rounded oﬀ the swap spread rate that we announced last year.
We traded about €400 million in government bonds and moved them into long-dated
swaps to ﬁnalize the hedging of our swaps exposure. All in all, the re-allocation of assets
to more risky assets, the completion of the swap spread trade will, in the long run, support
the annual capital generation. Think about the number around €15 million to €20 million
on annualized basis.
In terms of your models, we believe it's fair to have that additional number kick in in the
course of the year, so not so much per one 1st of Jan. During the course of the year, the
run rate capital generation will go up. And think about an annualized number of about €15
million to €20 million because of this re-risking. Of course, depending on your return and
spread assumptions.
Solvency, page number 9. Eligible own funds and required capital both increased for a
net delta in our Solvency ratio from 189% to 188%. The required capital up €133 million.
That €133 million is made up of roughly €144 million increase in market risk, €53 million in
insurance risk and €21 million in counterparty risk. Shows your market risk up, insurance

FINAL

risk up because of portfolio growth, counterparty risk up due to mortgage allocation. And
you subtract from that (20:05) strategic beneﬁts and the LACDT eﬀect on the higher SCR,
gives you net-net an increase in required capital of €133 million. But very pleased against
that in a very robust and solid increase in the eligible own funds of €240 million.
So, net-net, own funds up €240 million; required capital, up €133 million. And we're very
pleased that we're, even in a challenging rate environment, able to continue to grow our
own funds and add €240 million own funds in the quarter. And this is consistent with an
underlying increase in Solvency of about 6 points in the last quarter.
Please note that Tier 1 capital is very strong, 85% of the own funds. We have no
restrictions on tiering. Restricted scope for Tier 1 with over €1.1 billion; Tier 2 or Tier 3,
around €725 million. We do not have any Tier capital usage. Actually, we ended last year
with a DTA, small DTA of €11 million. That ﬂip side now has become a DTL in the ﬁrst
quarter. So, we're very pleased that the Solvency level is strong, the accretion is strong,
but also the buildup is strong with a signiﬁcant portion of Tier 1 capital and no tiering
restrictions, actually headroom in Tier 1 and Tier 2 and Tier 3, which makes this a very safe
and stable and solid number.

Bloomberg Transcript

Also like to note, if you look at, for those of you who have a history at ASR, the quarterly
Solvency numbers, I mean I looked at that yesterday evening. Between the ﬁrst quarter of
2016 and the ﬁrst quarter of this year, there have been ﬁve quarterly numbers. Our
Solvency ratio actually ﬂuctuated between 186% and 191% in those quarters. So, on a
quarterly basis, the ﬂuctuations tend to be very small and manageable and have been
very, very stable.
Actually if you exclude last year's ﬁrst quarter, we've always managed – or we put about
four quarters in a row at a Solvency between 188% and 191%. So, very stable and robust
set of Solvency numbers.
That brings me to the conclusion, to the end of our presentation. Although not before I
said that our Solvency at a UFR of 2.2%. We've talked about it before as a interesting level
of Solvency, a more economic type of Solvency level that is now 143%. At a UFR at 2.2%,
our Solvency ratio would be 143%. So it's signiﬁcantly above 100%, signiﬁcantly above
120%, showing you again a pretty robust Solvency level.
So, to conclude, strong ﬁnancial performance in the ﬁrst quarter, great operating proﬁt,
strong operating ROE, some tailwinds especially in Non-life. Estimating the amount of
tailwinds is judgment. I would personally estimate that if you exclude those tailwinds, the
underlying operating proﬁt was in the €175 million mark, which still corresponds to a 15.5%
to 16% ROE, so the actual delivery is €191 million. Excluding a bit of luck, it's €175 million,
and that's a pretty robust and strong underlying number, and still an ROE of 15% to 16%
and above the quarters of last year – above ﬁrst quarter last year and above the last
quarter of last year. So we feel that Q1 was a strong and solid quarter, in which ASR
demonstrated continued to – that discipline in underwriting ultimately will bear fruit and
that the generation of capital also allows us to allocate capital to more risk-bearing assets
and further support our proﬁts.

FINAL

We've just come out of the AGM this morning where all resolutions have been accepted.
Most notably also the fact we are now allowed to buy back shares up to 10% of the
outstanding shares. So now we have a market-conformist buyback mandate, but all the
other resolutions have been approved. It took us three hours, but it was three hours well
spent.
With that, I'd like to end our presentation on the ﬁrst quarter numbers, hope to have
given you some color and some feel about what happened, and leave the ﬂoor open for
questions.

Q&A
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, we will start the question-and-answer session now. First question is
from Mr. Cor Kluis, ABN AMRO. Go ahead, please.

Q - Cor Kluis

{BIO 3515446 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Good afternoon. Cor Kluis, ABN. I got a couple of few questions, ﬁrst of all, about the
share buyback. Other than some share buyback approval, can you remind us how much
of share buybacks you could do this year, taking into account capital return targets that
you have mentioned? So, which part of 10% for 2017?
Second question is about P&C, 6% premium growth, and so it seems that you have been
winning some market share. Can you indicate where – in which product lines is that? Is it
across the board or ﬁre or motor, or give us comfort that this is high-quality business?
And my last question is more on check. If I fully understand it, on the re-risking and the
eﬀect on the earnings/cash ﬂow, I thought you mentioned that the re-risking was around
€18 million post operating result pre-tax for one quarter. And you said that for the full year,
it's €15 million to €20 million higher for the full year. How can we relate – after-tax of
course, but how can we relate those two ﬁgures? Those are my questions.

A - Chris Figee

{BIO 18815839 <GO>}

Cor, thank you very much. On the share buybacks, I said we've got a market consistent
mandate of about 10% of the outstanding share capital. It does not mean that we're going
to spend it tomorrow, but it's good to have a decent mandate. We've always said we think
it's fair that, especially in a year where the shareholder may be willing to exit and has been
demonstrating to be willing to exit, to support selldowns with share buybacks, we think
it's a wise way to allocate capital.
We've said also as a long-term plan, it's fair to assume that the maximum capital
distribution you do any year, on average, could be the annual capital generation. It could
be a bit more, it could be a bit less, depending on the circumstances, depending on the
year. But that's a good guidance, which means mentally we have a share buyback budget
of up to €100 million (27:18). If and how and where we'll spend it, it depends. We have the
Page 8 of 20



FINAL

Company Ticker: ASRNL NA Equity
Date: 2017-05-31

headroom. We think it's fair to assume to spend some of it during the year to support and
help management with selldowns. Especially if they come at a discount, we ﬁnd the ROE
on buying our own shares with discounts relatively attractive. But it depends on the time.
But in the long run, we believe annual capital generation is a good guidance for what you
can return to shareholders in the long run. And again, that on top of that depends also on
other allocation, other means of deploying capital. But surely, we're not going to be
capital holders just sitting on capital. We will think about what's the best way to dispense,
allocate it.
On Property and Casualty, it appears that we have been winning some market share. We
don't have the full market data, but 6% growth in P&C appears to be ahead of general
market growth. Where did it take place? It's very much retail business. It's retail business
in brokers. 50-50 split between the provincial broker and the mandatory agents. The bulk
of the retail growth actually is in packages, so customers sell or acquire motor, home, ﬁre
through a combination of products. So it's a combi-product that tends to grow pretty well.
So we feel that this is quality business because it comes through brokers that we know. All
of it is a provincial intermediary retail combi package, which tends to be – historically has
been highest quality business.

Bloomberg Transcript

Please rest assured that every performance review that we have as a management board
with the P&C team starts with the question, what about margins, what about underwriting
material? And we're comfortable that growth that's coming in is not at the expense of
underwriting criteria. The underwriting criteria are as strict as ever. We actually decline
more business than we write, than we accept, and we only accept the business that we
feel is actually value accretive.
Finally, on the re-risking, what you're pointing – alluding to, Cor, are two diﬀerent metrics.
The €18 million is a direct cash investment income, the coupons, rents, dividends received
in the ﬁrst quarter. They were up versus last quarter. Now, this is actually when they come
in, and coupon and dividend quarter – dividends tend to take place in the ﬁrst half of the
year rather than the second half of the year, meaning most companies pay dividends in
Q1 or in Q2.
So, it is actually upon receipt, you book these results. The €20 million is the increase in
long-term investment results according to the OCC deﬁnition. So, in our operational
organic capital generation, we have a number of long-term spreads that we assume at
€20 million, basically multiplies the delta in asset allocation times the long-run spreads.
So, the ﬁrst is actually the – the actual received – have actually received coupons,
dividends and rental incomes. The latter is really the modeled long-term investment
income that we'd expect.

FINAL

Yes. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. The ﬁrst question I have
is basically on the Life operating result. This was clearly quite strong. You mentioned to
have basically re-risked the customer portfolio by around 70%, 75%, so something extra
could still come. So, how sustainable is this run rate? I mean, can we basically start
annualizing this number, or do you think there's still some seasonal element in there or
some underlying pressure that make that conclusion maybe a bit too optimistic?
The second question I had is on the individual Life book. You mentioned that, due to the
shrinking, that you have some crossover, and basically does this also make you actually
more eager and willing maybe to look for some small bolt-ons in this space as well?
And my ﬁnal question is on the re-risking budget. So, is it fair to assume that in the second
quarter, there might be a further drag from market risk of around 2, maybe mix 3
percentage points? Thank you.

A - Chris Figee

{BIO 18815839 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

On the Life business, we believe the run rate is pretty sustainable. I mean, this has
increased due to direct investment income and increase in the capital gains reserve. So
this appears to be a pretty sustainable number. As I said, the tailwind was more in Non-life
than in Life. So, there could only be some ﬂuctuations in your investment results –
operating investment results in the Life business due to the ﬂuctuation of when the actual
direct investment income will occur. But there is nothing peculiar particularly to mention
around volatility in these numbers. So, it appears to be pretty stable number.
On the cost side in Life, there is an estimated cost overrun. We don't have a cost overrun
in Life, to be clear. But the cost margin – we have a positive margin on costs, so we make
the result on costs, but the result on costs is gradually declining as the book declines and
as the cost coverage declines. So, we still have a positive result on costs, but it's less than
a year ago. Our response against that is to variablize our cost base and move cost policies
on external platforms where we're paying on a cost-per-policy basis.
That program will be completed in the beginning of 2018. At this point, the program is
ongoing, and so we're making programming costs or is it migration costs. So, what you're
seeing today is that the cost coverage from the book is gradually declining and the
measures to counter that create a number of one-oﬀ migration costs that we'll have to
absorb. Net-net, at this point, the cost margin, the cost beneﬁt actually is actually
gradually declining and should be stabilizing as of 2018 and possibly grow over it again.
In terms of Life consolidation, we think it's good for the industry, it's good for the Life
insurance sector as Life books generally consolidate because this, after all, is a scale gate,
so more scale in Life is actually good. It does not mean we're about to go on an
acquisition spree in Life. But in general, consolidation of Life books on single platforms to
absorb the decline in cost basis or declining coverage basis is actually a good idea.

FINAL

In terms of re-risking, there are some small re-risking to be done, I said mostly on the
mortgage side and on the credit side. Will that be a capital drag? Less. First of all, these
are the lesser capital-intensive estimates. So, equity and real estate consume much more
capital than mortgages and spread products. Secondly, if and when we'll reduce some of
our equity exposure declines, if they participate in the oﬃce front, that will create some
capital relief.
So, in Q2, the amount of additional drag or additional allocation of capital to market risk,
net-net, is expected to be very limited.

Q - Albert Ploegh

And can I have maybe one follow-up on the share buyback program from Cor earlier? You
mentioned clearly to have preference to participate in selldowns. Of course, that depends
on your – intentions of your shareholder in the end. So, is it fair to assume that you will ﬁrst
await their decisions and not start, let's say, normal underlying buyback program
beforehand?

A - Chris Figee

{BIO 18815839 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Look, it's fair to say. In terms of our capital policy, we want to create value for our
shareholders organically, inorganically, or by buying back shares or paying dividends,
right? We believe it's fair that with the ROE that we have today, we think we demonstrate
that we're doing good stuﬀ with shareholder funds. If you look at the ﬁrst quarter, the
operating ROE was 17%. One can debate the cost of capital, but unlikely to exceed 17%.
So, we think we've created value to shareholders.
We believe the selldown of the government present or create a unique situation to
support shareholders and buy back some of the shares. And it's a unique situation where,
of course, especially for existing shareholder, once we reduce (36:51) and does so at a
discount, it's a great moment for the company to support it.
So the selldown of the NLFI is a special moment, a special situation that actually make it
very attractive for us to hand back cash to shareholders through share buybacks. Is this
then the ultimate proof that it will last forever? No. It's really centered around the share
buyback program of the government. And we're living on the assumption that they're
going to sell until the last share is sold. So, it's probably wiser to wait for additional capital
distributions and participate in their programs than launch anything on top of that.

Good afternoon, gentlemen. Could you speak up on the walk-through of the Solvency II
capital generation? I know you disclosed there was organic capital generation business
and market developments. But if you could sort of split that 6 percentage points up
between the three or any model adjustments or other assumption changes, that will be
very helpful to us.
And then on your 45% to 55% payout ratio target range via dividend, how ﬁxed is this
range or are you willing to pay slightly above and below?
And then ﬁnally, you mentioned your sort of ﬁrst quarter adjusted operating proﬁt around
the €175 million, maybe €180 million mark. If you annualize that, obviously you get to
about €700 million and then you take away the perpetual coupon and also tax, you get to
around a €500 million net operating proﬁt. Is this sort of the run rate we should expect for
the rest of the year and ongoing, or maybe you can't answer that question? Thanks.

A - Chris Figee

{BIO 18815839 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

On the ﬁrst question on Solvency II, we believe that the operational cap generation, we
ﬁnd if you have delta on Solvency, the most interesting element of it is how much own
funds does one create minus how much required capital does one actually absorb? The
market used to or is asking to bucket it into an organic cap generation and other, right?
We believe that's something you should not follow so much on a quarterly basis, more on
a semi-annual to an annual basis, because that is more in line to the long-term nature of
the insurance industry.
If you look at what happened in this quarter, the 6% – the eﬀect of 6% accretion in capital,
there were no beneﬁts from actually modeling changes. So, we didn't model up our
Solvency. We deﬁnitely did not, so no changes in there. So, 6% is a function of organic –
underwriting results, long-term investment results, and capital gains and capital
appreciation of the investment book. So, we don't really split it, formally disclosed into the
diﬀerent sectors.
But let's assume the 6% divided by 2, half of it is extraordinary market development in the
ﬁrst half, ﬁrst quarter, which are good. They booked it. And the other half is more long
term on the run capital generation that we have based on underwriting and reasonable
assumptions on investment returns. But, again, there was no modeling beneﬁt. We didn't
model up the Solvency. It really was all own funds based on underwriting results and
markets. And we have to acknowledge the markets, we're pretty good in the ﬁrst quarter.
Splitting those 50-50 is probably a reasonable amount.
In terms of our payout ratio, we have an oﬃcial policy that speciﬁes 45% to 55%. The
chance of us going below that, I would ﬁnd it pretty slim. Actually, it would be real strange
if we'll be below that number. Above that, we think if we get into situation that we feel that
we want this to distribute more, we would have suﬃcient ﬂexibility between special
dividends or buybacks. So, the ordinary dividends were between 45% and 55%. It's
reasonable to assume that we'll stick to that policy that had just been approved by the
AGM. Dropping below that, highly, highly unlikely. Going above that, we have suﬃcient
means to distribute capital if that is relevant.

And in terms of giving guidance for the year, we hear your calculation. Does not seem
unreasonable to us. But at the same time, we're only one quarter in the way, and we do
make a policy not giving guidance. So, it's too early for us to give formal guidance, but
your numbers are well noted.

Next question, Nadine van der Meulen from Morgan Stanley. Go ahead, please.

Q - Nadine van der Meulen

{BIO 15200446 <GO>}

Good afternoon and thank you for taking my questions. Firstly, the underlying operational
ROE that you mentioned, up 15%, 16%. Can you remind us why you're guiding for an ROE
of up to 12% given your track record so far?

Bloomberg Transcript

And the second question is, to have a bit of a better understanding of the income support
from the amortization of the current realized gains reserve, could you remind us or give an
update on what the realized gains reserve now is and also what is the shadow accounting
reserve? Because I think you last disclosed at the 1H result, this was just over €6 million.
But if you can give us an indication how volatile that is or where it is now.
And, yeah, lastly, given your capital generation and particularly given your comment just
now of sort of 3 percentage points longer term, I assume that that includes the €15 million
to €20 million increase from the re-risking. Sort of given that level, as you annualized that,
that's quite signiﬁcant and you have a very solid Solvency II ratio as it is. Can you
comment on your plans to grow? I mean, in the past, you've done successful small-scale
acquisitions. What are the areas that you're particularly interested in, or is there anything
in the pipeline on the Distribution side, Funeral, Asset Management? But do you also
consider participating in the Dutch Life consolidation as well? That's it.

A - Chris Figee

{BIO 18815839 <GO>}

On the operating ROE, I said the achieved ROE was 17%. We believe the underlying ROE
(43:28) been 15.5% and 16%. We are aware at the IPO, we've guided for something that
went (43:35) up to 12%. But the average of what we achieved in the years, in the run-up to
the IPO, it was a reasonable mechanical assessment. We understand the challenge of the
markets. That's something that we are actually reviewing and thinking about, although it's
less than a year since the IPO, so it might be early days to give new formal guidance
about the ROE. But again, we feel comfortable with the current trading that we have.
In terms of shadow accounting and capital gains reserve, I need to be a bit (44:10) careful.
Those are oﬃcial IFRS type of numbers, and we're not supposed to show IFRS numbers in
a trading update. But if you go back to last year's Annual Report, it's fair to assume that
the capital gains reserve stayed remarkably stable for (44:26) at the end of last year. And
the shadow accounting reserve, which is the underlying realized portion, obviously it

FINAL

ﬂuctuates more. It ﬂuctuates more with interest rates. But I don't think someone will kill me
if I say it's still a four-digit number, it still starts with a 3. That's about as far as I can go
without going too far into the IFRS domain. But again, cap gains reserve very stable.
Shadow accounting ﬂuctuates more with interest rates.
In terms of capital generation, we have to think about the 6% accretion, 50-50. Half of it is
more longer term, direct-ish reputable yield. The other half is great capital market runs.
And they may continue, they may not. In those 3%, there is some beneﬁt of the re-risking,
but not all of it, because the 3% which we've realized during the ﬁrst quarter, so the actual
inﬂux of Solvency in Q1 and the re-risking was executed during Q1 and wasn't completely
completed. So you may see some support going forward from that number.
And ﬁnally, maybe, how to spend that money? Do we participate in M&A? As part of our
strategy, we always like to deploy capital in a most eﬀective manner. We, of course, do
look at M&A situations, but (45:57) in terms of communication, when it comes to M&A,
there are two communication regimes. Regime A says, there's nothing to say. Regime B
says, there actually is something to say. And we're still very much in regime A mode; and
if we shift to regime B, you guys will be the ﬁrst to know.

Bloomberg Transcript

So I'm saying, we always look at ﬁles, we're very disciplined as we turned down more ﬁles
than we have accepted in the last year because we have very strict criteria, operating ROE
needs to be met, need to explain to our shareholders that we actually meet or at least can
stand up in the face of a share buyback as an alternative, and rest assured that's
something that we will apply in any future transaction. And again, there's nothing to say
until there's something to say.

Next question. Benoît Pétrarque, Kepler Cheuvreux. Go ahead, please.

Q - Benoît Pétrarque
Yes. Good afternoon. A couple of questions on my side. The ﬁrst one will be on the rerisking budget. It sounds like a 2017 budget which has been executed in the ﬁrst quarter
and you will be done in Q2. But what about kind of the long-term re-risking strategy, kind
of long-term asset allocation strategy? Are you going to review that again in January
2018? Is there more re-risking potential beyond what you have done? And obviously, your
Solvency II ratio is at 190%, good level, low leverage, standard formula. I mean, so long
(47:38) kind of good level on Solvency II, can we expect kind of more re-risking going
forward? And linked to that, have you seen any compression or tightening on the
expected investment returns in the ﬁrst quarter, but also in Q2? I mean do you see
something special on mortgages, for example? Do you see something on other asset
class as well?

Second question will be on the combined ratio. I was just wondering if you have seen any
prior year's provision releases in your combined ratio in the ﬁrst quarter, something
unusual.
Then the last one was on the Asset Management business. I think you are targeting a
growth of your third-party business. You clearly invested a lot to push the business. How
much has been the inﬂow so far in the year and how much you expect for the rest of the
year? Thanks.

A - Chris Figee

{BIO 18815839 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Benoît, thank you. In terms of re-risking, we run an annual strategic asset allocation
process every year. We do that in the autumn of every year. And last year, we ran the asset
allocation process, and we actually felt in November, December that there was room to
do more. So we continued the work – the analytical work on asset allocation into January,
at which point we concluded there was room to allocate a little bit more budget to market
risks. At this point, we feel very comfortable with the target allocation asset (49:18) where
there is some room to do, some runway to go, and declare the mortgage side. Then we
have an asset allocation that we feel very comfortable with.
Will we re-risk more over time? Honestly, Benoît, I don't know. It depends on how market
develops, how spreads develop, how the available capital develops. We run a process
every year. So the next run will be in November in our regular annual (49:49) cash
allocation program. And (49:53) safe to assume what is a reasonable – the asset allocation
is where we want it to be in the long run. Keep our book growth. Suppose if we grow our
asset base, then it will grow in these proportions. Further allocation to market risk, we feel
comfortable with where we are.
How do we look at spreads in the ﬁrst quarter? Obviously, on the equities side, we've
seen a great run. Whether equities are cheap or dear or rich, hard for me to express an
opinion given (50:25) deals appear to be holding up reasonably well. Credit spreads have
been holding up also reasonably well. We've seen some signs of compression on the
mortgage market. So competition in the Dutch mortgage market has been pretty strong.
So there's some sign of mortgage compression. At the same time, mortgage losses are
nil. I mean, I had a chat with the head of our bank. We have a small bank. They run an
€800 million to €1 billion mortgage book. They had literally €18,000 of foreclosure losses
on the entire €1 billion book last year. So we've seen some compression in spreads, but
also a complete evaporation of credit losses on the mortgage side. So, net spreads are
still attractive. We believe that the spreads that we actually were making and are able to
generate are still very safe and sound as compared to our long-term investment
assumptions, and that gives us some comfort around these numbers.
In terms of combined ratio, I can assure you there were no releases, no reserve releases in
this book, except real regular when you close a ﬁle and you may have reserved a bit more
than you actually need to settle the claim. But certainly, no extraordinary reserve releases.
Also, no notations, so a very clean quarter. In Asset Management, the inﬂow of new Asset
Management was between €300 million and €400 million of AUM in the ﬁrst quarter.

We have just launched our mortgage fund, our mortgage product in the ﬁrst quarter.
That's where we expect to see inﬂows. We will expect to see some inﬂows in our credit
proposition – credit proposal, and we expect to see inﬂows in the real estate oﬃce fund
during the year. So, we believe the €300 million in the ﬁrst quarter is a good run rate for
the year. Can you multiply it by 4? Ask me again in Q4, but it seems to be ongoing well.

Next question, Robin van den Broek, Mediobanca. Go ahead, please.

Q - Robin van den Broek

{BIO 17002948 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon, gentlemen. First question is coming back again to the mental
budget you mentioned for share buyback. I think the last selldown of NLFI had a 60-day
blackout period. A blackout period that's going to end soon. And if they keep that 60
days intact going forward, they could basically sell down in full probably this year already.

Bloomberg Transcript

Would you then still stick to that €100 million budget in that scenario? Because that's only
2.5% roughly of market cap and you've just asked and received approval for 10%. So, to
me, also given your statements that your return on equity had it, it's a sensible investment
basically. Would you shed some more color on that?
Secondly, on capital generation, you mentioned that there's an uplift from re-risking of €15
million to €20 million. I guess we should look at the full year, the 2016 run rate of €350
million to compare that. But then again, I think you also mentioned that the 3 percentage
point in the ﬁrst quarter is not fully reﬂecting that re-risking and if I would look at 12
percentage point of capital accrue in the year, you would get to over €400 million for the
full year. So, I'm still a little bit in the dark on how I should look at capital generation for
ASR this year. Those are my questions. Thank you.

A - Chris Figee

{BIO 18815839 <GO>}

Okay, Robin. In terms of the mental budget, we said like given the dividends that we have
paid out, given the shares we bought back in January, if you link it to the €350 million
capital generation realized last year, the mental budget between €80 million and €100
million. If, how, where we spend it, it depends on the situation. First of all, I don't know,
honestly, if, when and where the government is going to execute the next selldown and to
what stake. Really, it's not our decision to make. We're only followers of that. We would
like to make sure that we want to participate. You can count on us participating in a next
move. How much? It depends. It really depends. And also we think that a share buyback
as part of the government selldown should be in line with the amount of shares oﬀered.
So, will the government sell its entire stake before the summer? We may need to think
carefully how we participate in that. But that to be seen at this point, really, if there's a

Page 16 of 20

FINAL

reasonable gradual rundown, the number we mentioned is probably fair to assume. And
we have – there could be upside on that depending on the situation.
In terms of capital generation indeed, 3% in the ﬁrst quarter times 4 is 12%. That will be a
signiﬁcantly high number. At the same time, we said, look, in the ﬁrst quarter, some things
went really well. The number – the P&C returns were quite strong, and we need to see
how sustainable they are. So, it's fair to assume that the €15 million to €20 million is an
annual run rate. You could compare it to the €348 million, €346 million (sic) [€345 million]
we generated last year. What the actual number will be the during year also depends
where the exceptional P&C performance will continue.
So far, things are looking good. Even the ﬁrst months in the second quarter appear to be
okay. But again, we still have eight or nine months to go before the full year is over. But
we feel comfortable with the guidance we've given before on capital generation. We feel
comfortable that re-risking will contribute to that. And we feel conﬁdent that the ﬁrst
quarter, actually we were trading at the level that was above that. If, how and when that
will continue? We can only tell when the year progresses.

The second question is on the Non-life market. So, in the modern insurance market, this
might be a bit speciﬁc but I just wanted some color on this. So, in the modern insurance
market, we've seen that you guys are the most aggressive when it comes to pricing
compared to your peers. And what are the trends that you're seeing over there because
the market is quite heated up? Do you see this kind of pricing going forward, or do you
see something else happening over there?

increasing this part versus (57:23) you have quite a lot of room in the space? Thank you
very much.

A - Chris Figee

{BIO 18815839 <GO>}

Yeah. When it comes to deploying share buyback that we return capital to shareholders,
we believe selldown events should take center stage here. So, buying back shares in the
open market, if you are sure that there will be selldown events going forward. How many?

We don't know. On what blocks? We don't know. But that they will come, that's pretty
sure. So, we think it makes most sense to wait for those events as opposed to buying back
in the open markets. I mean, it will be a waste of capital and shareholder returns if you
buy something in the open markets, if next to that a buy-sell event would take place. So,
think about (58:16).

Q - Syed Anil Akbar

Bloomberg Transcript

In terms of Non-life, we actually do not see us as the most aggressive in motor; actually,
the opposite. I think if you compare us to peers, we're probably one of the most
conservative prices. We have two – actually, we have two product lines or brands, two
attacker brands that are based in the mandatory agents and really focused on Internetonly called Click & Go and (58:47). It's fair to say those who experienced pretty hefty price
increases in the coming months actually, we're going to use the current benign trading
environment to focus on margin expansion. So, you may see in the second quarter,
actually we're going to further strengthen our pricing positioning in the motor market by
holding or changing the pricing on two of our most – two of our more aggressive
channels. Although in general, we believe we are deﬁnitely not the most aggressive in
motor pricing. There are peers and players who actually have much more sharp pricing
than we have, but again, our focus will be further margin expansion over volume.
In Tier 1 instruments, look, we are pretty safe and sound when it comes to capital. We're
very pleased with the headroom that we have. Do we look at issuing new restricted capital
instruments? Always. We always assess the opportunity to attract capital at very favorable
terms. And it's very important. We're very pleased with the fact that we do not have any
tiering restrictions, no Tier 2, no Tier 3 restrictions. And those can come in handy in
various situations. So, if it comes to raising capital, we will make sure that we'll always
protect the Tier 2 and Tier 3 headrooms that we have.
So, we're looking at capital instruments all the time and always. We're always aware that
there has been no Tier 1 instruments in euros issued yet, at least not on the public market.
I've seen something between a holding company and a life insurance subsidiary, but I'm
not sure we want to replicate that example. But we do look at instruments out there, and if
we do something, we'll deﬁnitely protect and make sure there is remaining headroom in
Tier 2 and Tier 3.

Thank you. My operational questions have been answered. I just have a quick question on
the unit-linked mis-selling. There has been a bit more press. Particularly, there's an article
today about two of the main claimant organizations joining forces and encouraged by
one of the rulings against you in Den Bosch last month. So, I'm just curious. Could you
give us an update as to how you're looking at the situation and maybe give some
numbers around where the number of process were in 2006, where they are today,
ongoing outreach programs, et cetera? Thank you.

A - Chris Figee

{BIO 18815839 <GO>}

Okay. When it comes to the mis-selling situation, there have been a few rulings on KiFiD
(01:01:32). In the ﬁrst quarter, they have been generally positive for us, the KiFiD rulings.
There has been one court case about the (01:01:40) case in Den Bosch, which has been a
negative for us. To be quite frank, when we look at it, when our lawyers look at it, we are
bewildered by the logic that has been followed, and we are still assessing whether we'll
take it to the Supreme Court. We haven't made up our mind yet what we do and how we
deal with it. But we deeply disagree with the outcome. I mean, we question the legal logic
that has been applied. And how we deal with it going forward is something that has not
been decided yet.

Bloomberg Transcript

For the rest, no further cases. Any case we have seen had been postponed – that were
planned had been postponed further. So, there's nothing coming up in the very short run.
The next cases are scheduled for July. But they may be postponed again at the time. At
this point, it is too early to say if there's anything meaningfully changing, except for this
one court case where we're still assessing what to do with that outcome.
In terms of the number of policies, as indicated, the number of active unit-linked policies
has fallen back to around 220,000. We started with over 1 million in 2008 when we did –
we had the composition arrangements. Today, there are less than 220,000 policies still
left, still active, and the rest has either been settled or has been lapsed. But for us, no real
news on this topic rather than some press noise but no real material changes.

Q - Arjan van Veen

those to reduce that further?

A - Chris Figee

Yeah. They will either automatically lapse. Some of them will lapse as part of the

customer activation. So, AFM asked us, if you have a customer that may have a diﬀerent
policy, activate the customer so that he or she is aware and that he or she makes a
constant decision to either lapse the policy or continue the policy, and they were

Well, that leads me to the end of this call. I'll say thank you very much for your interest and

proﬁt and a record ROE. And if you strip out some of the tailwinds, still a very strong,
possibly even a record – still a record quarter, still a very high ROE.
So, whichever way you look at it, a very benign quarter. Again, it's a result without reserve
releases, without undue elements. It is, just by doing honest insurance business, I would
say, Solvency underlying growth about 6 points, invested into sharing back with our
shareholders and investing into market risks, which will eventually again feed into new
capital, feed in new proﬁts.
And with that, growth in market share in P&C is very favorable underwriting criteria. So,
we look back at a good quarter. We look back at a solid quarter. As you know, from us, we
do not get carried away by one quarter. So, we stay ﬁrmly sober and realistic, but the year
