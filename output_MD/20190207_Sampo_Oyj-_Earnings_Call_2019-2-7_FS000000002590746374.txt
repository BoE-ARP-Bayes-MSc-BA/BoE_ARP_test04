Bloomberg Transcript

Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this conference call on Sampo Group's Full Year 2018
Results. I'm Jarmo Salonen, Head of Investor Relations at Sampo. And with me at this call,
I have our Group CEO and President, Kari Stadigh; our new Group CEO and President,
Torbjörn Magnusson, starting from 1st of January, 2020; and our new Group CFO, Knut
Arne Alsaker.
As always, we'll start with Kari's introduction into the fourth quarter of 2018, but let me
remind you before that you can follow this call live on our website sampo.com/result and
a recorded version will be available at that same address later on.
Kari, I'll hand over to you.

Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Thank you, Jarmo. Welcome to the conference call on my behalf as well. We have a
history of presenting numbers very brieﬂy before the talk, but today I would like to talk a
little bit about people and governments because business in the ﬁnancial sector in the
end is all about people. And therefore, of course, I'm very happy that our board has
decided to nominate as my successor Torbjörn Magnusson. We have been Chairman and
CEO pair for 17 years, and delivered over the years something, which I think all of you
have appreciated. But this is maybe not the main point. The main point is that Torbjörn

FINAL

successor, Morten Thorsrud is also an internal nomination, and Ingrid who takes over from
him as Head of Private is also an internal nomination.
In front of me sits for the ﬁrst time on this call Knut Arne Alsaker as the new Group CFO
and he is also an internal nomination. I think this is a critical thing within the ﬁnancial
sector that you are able to create a culture which develops shareholder value and that can
be seen in the numbers year-after-year. So I would claim that these nominations really
create less volatility and stable and predictable earnings, because it's culture, people and
knowhow that counts. These can actually be seen in our last year numbers really well
because even if the investment environment was diﬃcult, our operative KPIs for the
insurance business were excellent.
If we correct it for one-oﬀs, the combined ratio for the full year 2018 was best ever. The
fourth quarter standalone was the best ever standalone measured by combined ratio.
Also our cost eﬃciency increased once again and the cost ratio is the lowest ever, and
really as the cherry on the cake, I think it's impressive that our growth continued. I think
we have now had almost two years with growth within the P&C sector, and we were
growing in all territories, all client segments, very promising indeed.

Bloomberg Transcript

You saw Topdanmark's numbers very stable, very good results and Torbjörn has been
chairing Topdanmark; in the next AGM, Torbjörn will step down in order to concentrate
the rest of the year more on his new chairmanship in If and chairing Nordea. Ricard
Wennerklint too has been on the board will become Chairman, and then Morten
Thorsrud, the CEO of If will join the Topdanmark board.
So after the management changes that have been executed in Topdanmark and the
continuity these nominations give to the board, I expect Topdanmark to perform well in
line of expectations going forward as well.
Mandatum Life reported its best ever operating proﬁt. That is of course to a great extent
thanks to the €197 million they booked from the agreement with Danske, but more
importantly Danske is now as the third largest bank in Finland, they have an exclusive
distribution agreement with Mandatum for insurance products. And of course
Mandatum's expense result was highest ever as were their unit linked sales. So, all in all,
excellent operational results on the insurance side.
On the investment side, it was disappointing to see that the investment market turned
really sour in the end of the year and I think on the whole we lost roughly €200 million in
our portfolios. However, the good news is that it's almost exactly the sum that we have
recovered in the ﬁrst weeks of this year. So we are back in the rink ﬁghting fully which is of
course very nice to see even if the volatility has been exceptional in last year, at the end of
last year in December.
We have made from the parent ﬁve investments in our core area which is the Nordic
ﬁnancials and with the hindsight if I look back to that I would do the investments again.
Probably, I could do some of them at a lower valuation. But on the other hand, we
wouldn't catch up the loss time if we were now in the market. And the loss timing is

meaningful because Saxo has launched a bid on BinckBank. Nets has already done a few
add-ons as well as Nordax and Asiakastieto is in the middle of a merger with UC. So very
good and promising development on that front as well.

FINAL

And lastly but not least we could see a good quarter for the parent given the interest rate
and currency rate development. This is, Jarmo, my summary for today. Shouldn't we open
up for questions?

Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

Yes, let's do that. Thank you. Operator, we are now ready for the questions.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. Our ﬁrst question comes from the line of Youdish Chicooree of Autonomous
Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Good afternoon, everyone. I've got three questions, please. The ﬁrst one is really on the
personnel changes. Your announcement today talks of the need to inject new energy in a
new phase of development. So I was wondering if you could elaborate on this new phase
and what role the new investor Cevian has to play in this, please? That's the ﬁrst question.
The second one is on whether you think the cost targets at Nordea are ambitious enough.
And ﬁnally the last question on non-life, and there seems to be some pricing momentum
in merger in Norway, and considering that your claims inﬂation experience is not as high
as peers, is it fair to say you're improving your margins in this business at the moment.
Thank you.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

The ﬁrst question I just want to clarify was it on Nordea that you...

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

That's right.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

...on the energy and the new persons. I could answer in the role of the chairing the
nomination committee, how the nomination committee looked at this. And as you
remember in the nomination committee, we have representation from the four biggest
shareholders i.e., Sampo, Nordea-fonden, Alecta, Varma. And then in the last meeting we
also had Cevian present as the newcomer.

Date: 2019-02-07

I think that the discussion in the NomCom has been unanimous on all fronts and we
shared a view on the board changes. So what was NomCom really looking for. I think it
was clear that now and Nordea during the chairmanship of Björn Wahlroos has done all
the big calls, €1 billion in IT, €700 million in compliance investments, de-risking, taking
down the risks in Russia, selling oﬀ Baltics, private banking Luxembourg, life business in
Denmark, and so on, it's a long list. On top of that, there has been re-domiciling the
headquarter, there has been branchiﬁcation of the legal structure. So huge major
projects.
Then the next phase naturally is execution. So the NomCom was looking for execution
expertise. And then they turned their eyes to Torbjörn who was proposed to become the
new Chair, and of course three very experienced people with a banking background. So,
that's the background for the decision, and it was unanimous. And as said, I have been
working together with Torbjörn for 17 years. So, I think I know him better than anyone in
the business sector or business life, and I'm convinced that the shareholders of Nordea
will get what they see.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Yes, very clear, very clear, thank you.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Your second question was.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

On the cost targets at Nordea.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

I think that's up to Nordea to answer, and not up to us. We can see a positive cost
development, and you have to be patient, and wait what Nordea communicates on that.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Torbjörn Magnusson
Torbjörn then. On the non-life question, you very accurately described the situation in
Norway, and we have as always been long term in our thinking, the market is receptive for
rate increases. So, they are coming through in a way which we feel is also accurate.
Let me add to that, that the one market which I have year after year being a bit
disappointed in the large corporate Nordic market has also been receptive to corrective
price actions. As you probably know, the big renewal there is the 1st of January and we
have been pleased to see the best renewal for at least 10 years.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Just one follow-up, would it be fair to say that actually at the moment, you're potentially
improving your margin but also increasing your client numbers as well.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

FINAL

We're maximizing value in doing both, yes.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Very clear. Thank you very much.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jakob Brink from Nordea. Please go
ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you very much. I have three questions please. The ﬁrst one is about Swedish
growth in premiums, in net earned premiums. Torbjörn, could you give us just some help
on what we should look for in 2019 given the tax change on motor in 2018 and how the
growth or what's the impact of that would on growth rates in 2019 please?
The second question is about the Mandatum Life SCR in Q4, is the decline and the SCR
fully markets driven or is something else going on there? And then, ﬁnally on this group
solvency on the ﬁnancial conglomerate, with Nordea increasing around €1 billion towards
the end of the year, I estimate that your solvency will drop to around 125%. I seem to recall
that, that's the sort of threshold you said you could not go under some years ago. Could
you give us some update on solvency and the whole change of the capitalization of
Nordea, please? Thank you.

A - Torbjörn Magnusson
The ﬁrst question, thanks for that really easy question to predict how many cars will be
sold in Sweden by month for this year. My expectation is that the comparison to the ﬁrst
half of last year will be a bit stretched as most suites chose to buy a car in the ﬁrst six
months, because of the tax change on 1st of July and then that the comparison numbers
become easier towards the end of the year, and that's probably as much as I can say
about that.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

And the second question on the SCR, yes it's market driven, also market related due to
the fact that there's a metric adjustment for equities in Mandatum changed. As market
goes down that metric is – adjustment is a dampener on that impact according to its own
regulation, contrarian market increase, it will increase also the SCR risk somewhat.

Date: 2019-02-07

Okay.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Could you repeat the third question on the group solvency?

FINAL

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

No, it's just if you adjust for the sort of increasing in Nordea capital consumption in
Sampo during 2019 as this Finnish systemic risk buﬀer increases. I get somewhat lower
solvency ratio for Sampo towards the end of the year than the end 2018, one. And so just
could you give us some help on what solvency level will you target, and is there any
updates on the implications of the Nordea capitalization change?

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

There's no news Nordea reported a risk exposure assets perfectly in line with what was
previously communicated. And that in itself is increasing our solvency requirement due to
the fact that, that increases Nordea's Pillar 1 requirement, which is what we use for our
solvency calculation.
What happens during 2019 is the systematic risk buﬀer for banks as introduced in Finland,
it will increase from zero to 2% 1st of January and will increase to 3% 1st of July which
again will be the percentage multiplied by the risk exposure assets in Nordea and our
share in Nordea that will impact Sampo's capital requirement. Then we have an ongoing
discussion with the regulator regarding this matter and other technical matters as well
since our clear view of course is that the risks for Sampo due to Nordea's moves to
Finland has not changed.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

But let's say you don't get anything out of the Finnish regulator then your capital
requirement will go up in Nordea by €1 billion as far as I estimate by Q3 of this year. And
your own funds will be roughly unchanged if you keep the current dividend, so slightly
increasing, which means that your solvency ratio will drop from current level to around
let's say 125% to 130%. Would that be a problem if that happens?

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Okay. If that happens, we will look into taking other measures to increase the solvency
ratio somewhat.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Okay, fair enough. Thanks a lot.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matti Ahokas of Danske Bank. Please
go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

FINAL

Hi. Yes. Good afternoon. I'd like to continue on the same topic, i.e., the Solvency I.
Obviously, we saw the decrease in the capital requirement from the internal models by
roughly €500 million in the quarter, but you're still writing the report that you expect or
you're looking into diﬀerent measures to counter the impact of the higher Nordea
requirement as Jakob mentioned earlier. What are these measures all together and or is
this still – are you referring to the internal model?
The second question is regarding the weather we're seeing here in the Nordics, a lot of
snow reminding me a bit like last Q1. What have you seen so far in terms of claims in the
normalized business weather related, should it be somewhat similar to Q1 2018? Thank
you.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

On the ﬁrst question, the discussions around the internal model is one of the discussions
we have ongoing with the regulator. As you saw in Q4, we got an agreement to use that
for the ﬁnancial conglomerate calculation, and that is also a discussion with the same
regulator to use for Solvency II purposes, so that's one of the things. There's a list of
things, which would adjust the risk position in the group somewhat, the drivers of the risk
position and there is also possibilities to utilize the fact that the Sampo groups have
ample hybrid capital capacity which we could use to increase the own funds. But the ﬁrst
action is to continue these discussions with the Finnish regulators.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Torbjörn Magnusson
Turning to the weather experts (00:19:41). There are two things that decide how much
winter losses, climate losses, winter weather losses you will have in the non-life insurer in
the Nordic region, one is how early and how severe the winter is when it comes because it
makes the ground frozen and houses freezing. That was late this year, so that's helpful.
Secondly, it depends on how prolonged the winter is and that was the issue last year
when we came out of it in Q1 with an expectation of a normal to benign winter and then
the winter continued for another month. So that's all I can say at this point in time.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

So I interpret Torbjörn your answer that it has not been as bad as Q1 2018.

A - Torbjörn Magnusson
We're in the beginning of February.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Fair enough. Thanks.

A - Torbjörn Magnusson

Company Name: Sampo Oyj

I remember 2010 when Kari asked me around this point in time if we would have loss or
winter losses, and I said probably not. And now we had the worst winter for 30 years.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

FINAL

Great. Thanks.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Ryan of Bloomberg
Intelligence. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Kevin Ryan

{BIO 1814771 <GO>}

Thank you. I just wanted to ask a little bit more about Mandatum and the Danske situation.
Could you give us some guidance on what you expect Danske to sell in terms of volume
this year and also what sort of product types, so we can get a feel for the capital usage
and that sort of thing? But any additional background on that would be really helpful.
Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Yeah. If I remember the volume in 2018 through Danske was maybe half of what it was a
year earlier. And that of course the uncertainty whether the distribution agreement would
be prolonged or not made an inﬂuence here, and possibly also some internal issues. Now
after we signed the new agreement, we started oﬀ by promoting risk insurance, mainly
loan insurance combined to their mortgage sales. And as a percentage of how many of
their mortgages have loan insurance, I don't know if Danske has published that ever but
we are doing much better now than a year ago. So that's not a volume product that you
see, but it's of course an important product for our risk ratio.

A - Torbjörn Magnusson
And it's not a driver of capital consumptions in Mandatum neither that nor the unit linked
product that Danske sells.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Yeah. Then of course, the next step which we would like to promote is that Mandatum is
one of the leading, or if not leading house, on alternative assets. So it would be great if
also these could be sold through the Danske distribution. But those plans have not yet
progressed. And they would also be sold – under probably a big part of the reinsurance
wrappers or even directly and that would not take capital either. So we are in the fee
business mode with them and share the fees.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Blair Stewart of Bank of America.
Please go ahead. Your line is open.

FINAL

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thank you, and good afternoon. I've got a few questions. Firstly, just coming back to the
considerations around the solvency position as and when the capital requirements for
Nordea go up. I was just wondering what considerations do you take into deconsolidating
Nordea given that the earnings yield is pretty much the same as a dividend yield would
make a great deal of diﬀerence to the numbers, but you would of course avoid after you
consolidate (00:24:07) the capital position.
Second question relates to the dividend, the dividend growth over the last few years has
been I think on the last six years has been averaging about 13%, 1-3-percent which has
outpaced the level of the underlying earnings growth. So I guess the question for you,
Torbjörn, as an incoming CEO, your ability to commit to the same level of generosity that
your predecessor has exhibited, that's my second question.

Bloomberg Transcript

And thirdly, I listened to the press conference call earlier today and you seemed to be
implying, rather simplistically but you seemed to be implying that the success that you've
had with the P&C business focusing on the customer, good IT, and good underwriting
replicating that success is what you're looking to do at Nordea. But of course the banking
and the insurance industries are very diﬀerent; the competitive challenges are diﬀerent;
the regulatory challenges are diﬀerent, so I just wonder if that's maybe an overly simplistic
assessment of the way forward. Thank you.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Yeah. On the deconsolidation, I don't think that tool – we have every measure in our
toolbox. But that toolbox, I wouldn't call it imminent because I remember how much I
enjoyed the investment community's approach to us when we started consolidating. So
some of my colleagues say that it's less important whether you consolidate or not. But
maybe I'm the old school, and then we see what the successors do.
Of course the situation might be diﬀerent if the reporting is fully in mark-to-market
environment, then these one line consolidations don't play that much into the game, but
that's in 2021. So I think that we have ample time to consider that mark-to-market
environment where it wouldn't be very diﬀerent if we are consolidating or not.
On the dividend, I would like to spare Torbjörn here a little bit and say that if I interpret
him. I think he's very artistic, so he really likes the – not really the percentages, but I think
he's actually artistic, he sings in a choir and so it might be that he adopts this idea of
beautiful graphically increasing dividend.

... he's an actuary, he's not artistic at all.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

How about Torbjörn, what would you say?

FINAL

A - Torbjörn Magnusson
Let's move on to the third question.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

On dividends, I think we are all committed to increasing dividends, and we see many
ways to continue to be owners and investors in businesses that create a growing dividend
yield for our shareholders.

A - Torbjörn Magnusson
And then, Blair, yes I think that banking and non-life insurance are very diﬀerent animals,
and I did not mean to say what I said at the press conference was the only actions
necessary for Nordea.
On the other hand I think that the ﬁelds that I mentioned are ﬁelds that were similar or are
similar between If P&C and Nordea and that there are also lessons to be learned.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Yeah, yeah. I was the one who was simplifying Torbjörn, I do recognize a point, but
Nordea is hugely complex animal, I guess, so you've certainly got a challenge there.
Good luck with it.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Yeah. Blair, I also think that – that one thing to consider is that if you have an oil tanker that
turns slowly once it creates momentum then it turns quite nicely also. And the banking
sector has one thing, it's really scalable. So I think that with the investments that are being
done there then the scale plays into a role. And then we must remember that all
disruptive businesses, there are also things where the new ﬁntech solutions, and so if we
look at them all the ﬁntechs, they want to have Nordea as their partner because Nordea
has the biggest amount of customers in the Nordics. It's the only truly pan-Nordic bank.
So therefore, as Nordea has developed the capabilities to be a gatekeeper and choose
the right ﬁntech partners, these could also improve their relative market position, because
I think many of us have been annoyed that the oﬀering between the Nordic banks is really
similar, and there has not been really diﬀerentiation. I think that in the digital world, we
will see more of a diﬀerentiated or client oﬀering and then I think Nordea is really wellpositioned. So I see the potential as signiﬁcant here.

Q - Per Grønborg
Yes. Thank you. Just a single question from my side. I struggled a little bit with the
dividend from If, if I look at page 10, it looks like the equity capital you have on page 10 for
If has not been that the dividend haven't been paid. If I look at the page 46 with the S&P
Capital base, that's obviously been deducted. Can you clarify what's the diﬀerence

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Huttner of JPMorgan. Please
go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Can you hear me? I'm calling from my mobile. So I have three questions. The ﬁrst one is
on the dividends and the growth. Maybe you could give a little bit of a feeling for where
you have potential buﬀers. The reason I ask is not all operations grow their dividends
smoothly year-on-year. And so, if one large division didn't have growth, what would be
the possibility for the others to kind of make the slack, and I just wondered if you could
give a feel for the excess capital in the various divisions, or maybe in the parent, which is
available to (00:31:26) should it be needed? This is really just the question.
The other one is the combined ratio of 85.2% and I apologize came to the call (00:31:36)
and maybe a bit late. How sustainable is this? This is an extraordinary number. However,
Page 11 of 16



Company Name: Sampo Oyj

FINAL

listening to the early answers, you seem to imply that the margin is actually rising both in
Norway and in Finland commercial lines. And so that margins are rising from this level.
And I just wonder if you can give a feel for are we now at a stable level? We've been at
85% in the last two years or can we now improve as a further kind of step function going
forward?
And then the ﬁnal one is Kari you said – and I was looking at Bloomberg that you said you
came to retirement only in a legal sense and I just wondered what you meant by that?
Thank you.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Well, that was a very personal comment. I don't like the word retire. So legally I'm
deﬁnitely out from Sampo by the end of the year. But privately, I'm of course continuing to
work in some other capacity, but not within the Sampo Group. On the dividend side, if
you want us to paint the picture that if something awful happened, could we manage one
year with interim dividends for instance. If that's your question, I think you must remember
that we are strongly capitalized.

Bloomberg Transcript

So we have never taken any internal dividends to the extreme. And I think we have
communicated that the surplus capital through a theme (00:33:14) capitalized is how
much. It's €1 billion probably. So there are ample resources and then we have of course
many times commented to you that we haven't maximized subordinated debt in the
entities within the group.
And of course the third lever is that now we have direct investments in the parents which
are not there to be kept forever. So all these together – but then the fundamental thing of
course underlying here is that as a group, we are geared to beneﬁt a lot from increase in
interest rates if that ever happens. The deposit margin will appear in the bank P&L, the
discount rates will release capital from our liability side, and of course our ﬁxed income
portfolio will earn much more. So we are still positioned in a situation where we target
slowly increasing dividends.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

And the bad book (00:34:30) from Mandatum is that still releasing capital?

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

That's also a good comment, you are on the ball. So the goal with (00:34:37) proﬁt
portfolio decreases by at least €200 million a year, and if we have a solvency of 25% that
releases €50 million a year as well. You're right.

A - Torbjörn Magnusson
And then the 85.2% combined ratio is not an extraordinary number. We aim for high
returns, which you can also see in Topdanmark where the combined ratio is lower than
that, but also and as importantly I think, if you look at the Nordic market as such, our peers
are also at least striving for combined ratios in the region of what we are achieving.

Thank you. And our next question is a follow-up from Blair Stewart of Bank of America.
Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thank you. I didn't expect to come on so soon. A couple of things. Can we come back to
the €1 billion comment that you just made in terms of the surplus capital within the P&C
business because on an S&P basis, I know that you've paid the dividend at the end of the
year, it's more like €200 million, so I just wonder how you got to that €1 billion?
Secondly, on Mandatum looking at Q4, you earned almost as much in the risk result and
the expense result in Q4 as you did in the ﬁrst nine months of the year. I just wonder is
there anything exceptional within there or is that just a very strong quarter?

Bloomberg Transcript

And Kari, you talked about losing €200 million due to investment markets which had
been replaced so far this year. If I look at your fair value adjustment reserve, it went down
by €400 million. So I just wonder how we can reconcile that, and has that €400 million
more or less been topped back up so far this year with market moves? Thank you.

A - Torbjörn Magnusson
On the excess capital of If, you're right if we were to look at the rating of cluster A
(00:36:46) dividend then a €1 billion is stretching it. But of course the rating – for exactly
the S&P model, but that's not an exact number. And Kari's comment was also related to
having a more lower Solvency II ratio in If and focusing more on maximizing the capital
from a solvency perspective and not necessarily referring back to the rating, the S&P
model. And the other one was on at Mandatum at Q4.
(00:37:25)

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

So if there is anything exceptional on cost and risk result?

A - Torbjörn Magnusson
On the costs, there is no exception, it was a very strong Q4 and full year on the expense
result in Mandatum, it was the best ever, actually. Then if you were to look forward, you
should remember that we previously said that when Danske starts selling the commission,
we'll pay to Danske. It's somewhat higher than what would be the average commission
level in 2018.

FINAL

So you should bear that in mind when thinking about the expense result going forward.
But in Q4 excellent expense result in Mandatum and full year as well. The only thing that
was special was a smaller reserve release which contributed to the good risk result in
Mandatum in 2018 and in the fourth quarter of – sort of single digit million euros, low
single digit million euros that's the only special item in the Q4.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

And did you ask about...

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Sorry to interrupt, Kari, should we think about those numbers as a run rate apart from the
reserve release given that the Danske agreement is now back up and running fully, should
we think about those numbers for a run rate going forward?

A - Torbjörn Magnusson
I think the risk result for Mandatum has been fairly stable at the current level for a number
of years, so I would consider that as a run rate. The expense results which we had in 2018,
I think is also a reasonable run rate. My comment was also that you shouldn't expect that
to increase in the same way that its assets down over the last few years.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Understood. Thank you.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Yeah. There was the question of €200 million of – so to get that numbers to match, I think
that we lost €200 million last year on investments and we have made up that this year. But
then, the reserves were partly – or do you want to answer?

A - Torbjörn Magnusson
The fair value reserves, it's both the mark-to-market value changes and the fact that we
sold oﬀ some assets, reduced our equity exposures during the year and then in Q4, which
contributed as of end of Q3 to the fair value reserve.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you (00:40:08)

FINAL

(00:40:33) I'm just asking a little bit more and maybe you've answered it, so then I listen
to the replay. Apart from the pricing where you said the merger in Norway and I think
liability of commercial lines in Finland what's the price doing in the other markets, please?
And on the weather where it sounds to me in weather I'd just say is you really don't know
but sounds to me with 2018 was maybe a little bit behind due to the late start of winter. Is
that something we should kind of normalize for? Thank you.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Pricing in Sweden is very rational, there have been very few moves in market share for a
long time, no change there except for the large corporate business Torbjörn had just
mentioned, Finland big changes in 2017, rate reductions and despite that we have a very
good result in Finland and no change, no big changes in market share this year. Denmark
same thing. And the winter last year was deﬁnitely not benign, maybe not that much
worse than normal, but you don't need to normalize anything there because it continue
for so long into the – what is normally the spring in April and before it ended.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Got it. Thank you very much. And a ﬁnal question (00:42:03) there was a storm right on
the cusp of the New Year's Day, can you say anything about that? Sorry, this maybe a very
late question.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

The answer was timing.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

All timing. Thanks you. That's all I had. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. The next question is another follow-up from Blair Stewart, Bank of America.
Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Yeah, just more of a comment than a question. I just wanted to say congratulations
Torbjörn on the promotion. It's been a long time coming and it's nice to see a fellow
actually going up in the world, but listening to the press call today, I noticed the Chairman
and CEO refer to each other as cookie and Nalla (00:42:50). So one observation would
be that you're going to have to get yourself a nickname if you're going to be successful in
this job.

A - Torbjörn Magnusson
Thanks a lot, Blair. I'll keep that in mind and think about it.
