Presentation
Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. This is Gianandrea Roberti. I'm Head of Investor Relations at
Tryg. We published our Q4 full year results this morning. And so I have here with me the
Group CEO, Morten Hubbe; and Group CFO, Christian Baltzer, to discuss the numbers. A
few words, over to you, Morten.

Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Thank you, Gian. And a good morning to all of you from my side as well.
Starting from Slide three with the highlights of Q4. We show a Q4 pretax result of DKK
685 million compared year-on-year to DKK 650 million adjusted for one-oﬀs in Q4 '16; a
technical result for the quarter of DKK 622 million compared to DKK 564 million year-onyear adjusted, driven by a combined rate of 86%, clearly underlying a strong improved
trend in claims ratio and expense ratio. And bear in mind, when it comes to adjustments,
that there are no adjustments in Q4 '17, only adjustments in Q4 '16. And most of you
probably remember. But they relate to the property sale in Q4 '16 and the IT and
Securator write-downs in Q4 '16 as well.

In Q4 '17, we have investment income of DKK 86 million compared to DKK 98 million
adjusted last year and primarily boosted by equities in the free portfolio.

FINAL

Dividend per share for the quarter of DKK 1.6, accumulating to a full year dividend per
share of DKK 6.4. Then, of course, bear in mind the extraordinary dividend of DKK 1
billion, as announced at the Capital Markets Day and to be approved by the upcoming
AGM.
On solvency ratio, of course, an unusually high number of 281 due to the capital increase;
196, adjusted for that capital raising for Alka. And then expected approximately 170 when
the deal is approved and payment has been carried out.
Finally, on this slide. The Alka acquisition announced in December will strengthen our
Danish market share and our most important business segment, Private lines Denmark.
General market share in Denmark will increase by 4%; Private lines, roughly 6%. And we
expect to create signiﬁcant value for both customers and shareholders.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now if we turn to Slide 4, we elaborate on the customer highlights. NPS targets for the full
year achieved. And we see our new measure, transactional NPS, increasing to 62 from 59
in Q3. We see that the full 3-year targets for 3-plus products has been achieved for
Denmark and also now starting to improve in Norway, better late than never, by the
signiﬁcant jump now towards the end of 2017.
Retention rate target has been achieved for Denmark. It's fair to say that, that number has
been challenging in Norway during the spring. The churn of entire market increased from
14% to 19%; a lot less for us. And now towards the end of '17, we're now starting to see our
general customer loyalty increase again.
Then important to see that in both Denmark and Norway, a continued increase in the
number of claims reported online, important for our future eﬃciency measures.
On Slide 5, we elaborate on the technical result by business area. Improved technical
result by more than 10% for the quarter compared to year-on-year and 6% for the full year
adjusted. Continued strong performance in Private, we see both underlying improving.
And then weather being quite helpful and benign. Commercial has strong results. But
they're impacted by higher level of large claims, whereas Corporate show improved
results but are helped also by lower level of large claims. We are actually still not satisﬁed
with the underlying development in Corporate lines. And we see several areas where
rates need to go up, particularly in Norway and Sweden. And we are seeing the ﬁrst signs
of that in the 1st of January renewal, particularly in Norway. Sweden Private delivered
slightly higher results year-on-year and quite satisfactory given the size of the business.
Slide six shows a very strong shareholder progress on track. We see historical strong
development in valuation, particularly from 2011 until now, compared to the general
industry. We have a very strong focus, remaining on stable and increasing ordinary
dividends. But you should expect that we -- assuming normal business and the Alka
integration, you should, not surprisingly, not expect extraordinary dividend for 2018. We

FINAL

will have one-oﬀ charges during that year. And we will have a limited period where we get
the positive earnings from Alka and only a limited proportion of the synergies. Of course,
we do not know exactly yet when we get the authority approval. But just before the
summer holidays would be a qualiﬁed guess.
On Slide 8, we elaborate on the premiums. Satisfactory growth in local currency of 1.9%
for the group. There is positive top line growth in all business areas. And for the ﬁrst time
in more than 10 years, we see the -- a slight growth in the number of customers in both
Denmark, Sweden and Norway in both Private and Commercial lines. Clearly, the mothership of Private lines Denmark carries the biggest weight, with the growth of more than 3%.
Sales in general. But more importantly, the sales of packages that allows us a broader
share of wallet. And also the customer bonus is starting to help both retention rates and
sales.
As mentioned, Norway was more challenged, particularly during the ﬁrst half of '17. But
we're starting to see some improvement during -- particularly Q4 '17. Commercial shows a
growth of 2.3%, signiﬁcant improvement year-on-year. But of course, helped by OBOS,
roughly DKK 20 million. But also, we see improved underlying customer development in
both Denmark and Norway.

Bloomberg Transcript

Corporate growth seems high at 3%. But bear in mind that the fronting business in
Sweden pulls up the numbers, which is really something that increases our general
income with no additional risk.
In Sweden Private lines, we see a positive premium development. Bear in mind that at
previous quarters, we're helped by the inclusion of Skandia. That is now no longer the
case. So 5% is actually organic. And we see particularly that our small niche of pet
insurance in Sweden has developed very strongly.
On Slide 9, we elaborate on price development. As in previous quarters, we continue to
see an increase in average premium for all products. We're quite happy to see, for
instance, a 3.1% increase in Danish motor. And of course, this shows our focus on
proﬁtability. And we spent a lot of resources monitoring development in claims inﬂation
to react as early as possible, both on claims measures and adjusting prices accordingly.
On Slide 10, we elaborate on retention rates. We see a very positive development in
Private lines Denmark, with the retention of 90.2%. Clearly, we're starting to see the early
signs of the customer bonus scheme helping. But also, this focus on packaging and
broadening share of wallet means that more and more products are getting sold to
individual customers. So the relationship gets stronger. And that helps retention.
As I mentioned, the general market churn in Norway has been increasing; less so for us.
And we are pleased to see now that after decline in retention rate, Private lines Norway
now has a positive trend in Q4.
In Commercial Denmark, we see a positive development in retention. We have been
testing in 2017 a new customer service concept, with a lot more frequent contact to our
Page 3 of 21

customers. This is helping our customer satisfaction. It is helping our customer loyalty.
And in many cases, we see customers liking products like cyber and other products as
well. So that has been very positive. Commercial Norway saw a slight drop due to the
general market trends but also some price adjustments. On the other hand, sales has
increased a bit.

FINAL

So over to you, Christian.

Christian Boris Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

Thank you, Morten. Good morning, everybody.

Bloomberg Transcript

So like Morten already mentioned, we have seen an underlying improvement trend for Q4
2017 and the full year 2017. As communicated in the beginning of the year, we were
pleased to see the underlying improvement of our business. On group level, for Q4, we
are seeing here a 0.4percentage point improvement and speciﬁcally driven by the
improvement in our Private business of 0.6percentage points. Now for 2018, we expect a
3% price increase across the book that will broadly oﬀset inﬂation for 2018. We anticipate
2018 underlying improvement to be improving, yes, in 2018.
Going to Page 13. We, as Morten mentioned, are spending a quite a lot of time focusing
on our auto book to see how claims frequency and claims severity is developing. And we
have here updated the comprehensive claims frequency graph that we showed before
and are seeing a slight trend downwards compared to the increases before. Now this
does show still a little increase in frequency. The increase in severity is somewhat in line
with inﬂation. However, this is an area that we continue focusing on and are oﬀsetting by
price increases.
Turning to Slide 14. Now 2017, in general, has been a very good insurance year from a
weather and large claim perspective (inaudible). We are roughly having a DKK 500
million better technical result compared to an average year on large claims and weatherrelated claims. Interest rates maintain low. And we have a runoﬀ level in 2017 that has
been at 5.4percentage point.
Turning to Page 15. As mentioned before, our 14% expense ratio target has been reached,
as we also communicated at our Capital Market Day. This has been done predominantly
due to some of the eﬃciency programs or through the eﬃciency programs that we've put
in place and has also helped us reach our strong ﬁnancial target. FTE development in the
Fourth Quarter is a little bit up. And this is due to our acquisition of OBOS and the FDM
portfolio.
Turning to Slide 17. Asset allocation is broadly unchanged. There is an increase of DKK 4
billion from the capital increase, which you will ﬁnd mainly in the match portfolio Danish
part. Bear in mind that the property exposure currently is still under our target, left in our
target. And where we have a target of investment in property around 20%.

FINAL

Turning to Page 18. Morten already mentioned that we, for the Q4, has a result of DKK 86
million investment return, which is coming mostly from our free portfolio. Bear in mind
that in Q4 '16, we had a DKK 500 million gain from selling of properties. We've seen the
result on the free portfolio mainly driven by equity of just below 5% and on our inﬂationlinked bonds. The match portfolio is broadly 0 or close -- is DKK 13 million. Bear in mind
that the match portfolio, on a guided basis, is around 0 in returns.
Turning to Page 19, on our Solvency position. There has been some movements here in
the Fourth Quarter. And as mentioned on our Capital Market Day, we have improved our
workers' comp model and have gotten this approved by Danish FSA, which is giving us
DKK 160 million reduction in the SCR. There's a good amount of currency development in
this. And you broadly need to summarize all and have this DKK 160 million is a net ﬁgure
of the -- both currency and the workers' comp improvement. On the own funds, we're
seeing some movements from the capital raise of about DKK 4 billion and the result of
2000 -- Fourth Quarter 2017. And the dividend is shown here as movements.
Turning to Page 20. Just a single highlight from this is basically our Tier 1 potential. Bear in
mind, our Tier 2 is fully utilized. On the Tier 1, after -- or post acquisition of Alka and
closing of Alka, our Tier 1 potential will be around DKK 650 million. And as mentioned at
the Capital Market Day, we are issuing a Tier 1 debt -- subordinated debt of DKK 500
million, partly to fund the Alka acquisition.
Morten, back to you.

Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Thank you, Christian.
And ﬁnally, on Slide 22, we repeat our targets and outlook, not a lot of surprises there. We
expect the top line growth between 0% and 2% in 2018, excluding Alka. Now some of you
may think that the top line growth expectation seems overly conservative given that FDM
and OBOS will add approximately 1.5%. But bear in mind that it is likely that our corporate
exposure would shrink somewhat during '18. We are quite keen to see that our need for
rate increases in Corporate, particularly in Norway, is carried out. And we will see what is
the customer reaction to that. But it is likely that there will be an impact. And that could
shrink the Corporate exposure while improving the bottom line. So clearly, worthwhile
from a shareholder point of view and a sustainability point of view. But that is the negative
we have put on the top line outlook for the year.
When it comes to the acquisition of Alka, bear in mind that we have elevated our
technical result target for 2020 to DKK 3.3 billion on account of Alka. We have a return on
equity target of 21% post tax. Then bear in mind that in the coming 5 to seven years, you
will see an annual depreciation of customer relations of approximately DKK 100 million to
DKK 150 million annually pretax. It will be posted other -- on the other income and costs,
similar to what we did on Securator and therefore not included in the technical results.
And bear in mind that customer relations is already deducted, from a capital point of view,

Page 5 of 21

in old funds. And therefore, the annual depreciation will not impact the dividend
potential.

FINAL

Then just to repeat that 2018 will be an intermediary year when it comes to one-oﬀ costs
and the integration beginning of Alka. And as such, not surprisingly, you should not
expect extraordinary dividend for 2018.
Then, of course, ﬁnally, on Slide 23, we repeat our preferred John D. Rockefeller quote on
dividends because that is an extremely important part of our business model and our
focus. And we look forward to making sure that in the future, we harvest the beneﬁts from
Alka and actually improve our long-term dividend potential.
And I think with that, we will start taking your questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) And our ﬁrst question comes from the line of AsbjÃ¸rn MÃ¸rk from
Danske Bank.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - AsbjÃ¸rn Nicholas MÃ¸rk
A couple of questions. First, on Norway and the Corporate, Commercial segment. Morten,
you said that you've seen prices come up 1st of January. And you've also talked about sort
of a need for general sector repricing the last couple of quarters. So could you elaborate
a bit on what is it that is really changing 1st of January? And this is just a short-term eﬀect,
or is it more fundamental?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well I think, ﬁrst of all, important to distinguish between Commercial and Corporate as
they are in quite diﬀerent scenarios. Commercial pricing has been reasonable, whereas
Corporate pricing in Norway has been declining over the past 4 or ﬁve years. During the
autumn of '17, we communicated in writing to the Corporate markets that we would be
carrying out price increases 1st of January, both directly to customers and directly to
brokers, which is a quite unusual step. We have seen subsequently that several other
players in Norway have communicated also plans to increase prices in corporate, also in
writing. And if you look at the general statistics for the Norwegian corporate market, there
is really no doubt that the entire market needs price increases. Our highest price
increases 1st of January are in the ﬁsh farming, where we have a signiﬁcant 2-digit price
increase. Then we have a single -- mid-, high single-digits price increases in a number of
other lines, whereas we're still struggling to get the prices on workers' comp to move
much above 0. So we should see a positive impact from that 1st of January to the bottom
line, while probably negative to the top line. But I would expect that the general market
moves in this direction. And I would expect it to continue into 2018. But of course, bear in
mind that it could have a negative impact on the top line.

Q - AsbjÃ¸rn Nicholas MÃ¸rk

FINAL

Okay. If I then go to your motor insurance, the combined motor insurance. I sort of
calculated the combined ratio, that is around 110 basis points lower in '17 versus '16. And it
doesn't really seem to ﬁt with the sort of the slides you have on how you're seeing claims
come up here. I know that you've said that in Q4, you've seen an improvement. But still,
could you elaborate a bit on this and maybe also if there's any diﬀerences between the
Norwegian and the Danish market here right now?

A - Christian Boris Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

AsbjÃ¸rn, this is Christian. I think when you're looking at some of our reported numbers,
you have to bear in mind that, ﬁrst of all, this is combined with all our diﬀerent covers.
And what we have seen is an increased frequency in comprehensive, which is kind of like
the core of the auto book and can see that from 6 -- or from 2014 to 2017, there has been
an increase in the frequency in this area, which has been kind of subjecting needs for
price increases. What we noticed is that over the last three years, frequency has come up
both in Denmark and in Norway. But the most signiﬁcant increase has been in Denmark
and has been more ﬂat over the last two years in Norway. So there is a diﬀerence between
Denmark and Norway in these numbers.

Q - AsbjÃ¸rn Nicholas MÃ¸rk

Bloomberg Transcript

But also, if I look at the comprehensive, there seems to be 70 basis points of improvement
in '17. So maybe just touch upon what is sort of the repricing potential from here as you
see it.

A - Christian Boris Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

I think from -- as you can see on the average prices, we're carrying out about -- a little over
3% price increases on the auto book in Denmark and has been a little bit less in Norway. I
think we can continue seeing that auto should be a place where we'll be able to have a
potential for repricing. With respect to this 70 basis point that you are mentioning, there is
also windshield coverage, there's a lot of other coverages going into the overall ﬁgures
that you're looking in our annual accounts compared to where we're trying to clean out
the comprehensive part when we're showing the statistics in our slides.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I mean, fundamentally, AsbjÃ¸rn, you're right, that the development in '15 and '16, you
could have argued, should have catered for even higher price increases, whereas the
development in '17, to some extent, pulls it in the opposite direction. But all in all, we see
the slightly longer trends and attempt to pull the pricing of motor slightly upwards. And
as we know, change on our attitude on that, regardless of '17, looks a little bit better.

Q - AsbjÃ¸rn Nicholas MÃ¸rk
Okay. Then on the intangible write-down, the 5 to seven years and the DKK 100 million to
DKK 150 million, (if it's sort of at) the mid range here, you're sort of guiding for DKK 750
million of total write-down. It seems to be somewhat higher than at least what I thought
you communicated after the closing of the -- or the announcement of the Alka deal. Are
Page 7 of 21



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2018-01-23

you -- have you been surprised by the level, or is there something changed here? I know
that you reiterated your ROE guidance. So -- but just maybe a little bit clarity here.

FINAL

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well I think, AsbjÃ¸rn, that ﬁrst of all, when you do an acquisition, you have to carry out the
purchase price allocation. And you need the information to do that. And it's not unusual
that in a speedy process, the purchase price allocation has not been carried out prior to
communication. So to be honest, I don't think there's anything surprising or unusual with
the amounts. But we didn't actually know the size -- precise size of the amounts at the
point of time and communication. And to be honest, you can hear from the range of DKK
100 million to DKK 150 million pretax, that is actually not ﬁxed yet either. We just thought
that it was better for all of you to understand that this was a part to include in the
modeling and then rather wait for the precise agreement with the auditors on this
number. So not surprising but not something we have clarity on at the point of time of
communication either.

Q - AsbjÃ¸rn Nicholas MÃ¸rk

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Then a ﬁnal question from my side. On the newspaper yesterday, on the 50% stake
that you've taken in (Andu), the insurance agency. Now you will be selling, through this
agency, insurance prices -- or insurance at prices of 25% to 35% below Tryg's prices. And
now you're also going to do the dual-brand strategy with Alka, with lower price at least in
some areas. So how do you see this in the longer term? Is this a net neutral or positive or
negative? Is it ﬁrst sign of sort of a disruption in the market? And do you think you will be
able to do sort of a diﬀerent pricing in diﬀerent categories going forward?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well I think, ﬁrst of all, it's important to say that if the pricing elasticity in our markets was
enormous, then people would always ﬂock to the carrier with the lowest price. And I
guess, if that was the case, then when we introduced our 8% membership bonus,
everyone should travel to our company. And I guess we all know that, that did not
happen. So I think we should just bear that in mind because it tells you something about
how high or low the interest and pricing is. I think when it comes to (Andu), what is
important to see is that, if you look at young individuals below 24 years of age, 40% of
these young individuals have no insurances today at all. So if their bicycle is stolen, their
computer is stolen, their apartment is emptied, there's no insurance. If you look at
Lemonade in the U.S., what has been shown is that you could start selling, for instance,
content insurances to young people who've previously never bought an insurance. So
that is not cannibalization. It is actually expanding a market which was not previously
there. If you look at the actual cover, it's not the same cover. There's a number of covers
which is included in a normal content insurance, which is not included in the Andu
content insurance because it has been narrowed down and sharpened to precisely the
need of very young individuals that has a lot of less value and a lot of less things that
needs cover. So it is not a comparable product at all. So for us, you should really more see
this as a concept of testing how far can we go on online sales and how can we go -- far
can we go on online processing, taking out the processing costs; and how far can we get
in getting young people to buy insurance, which they would otherwise not buy. So we do
not fear the cannibalization. And we do not see, from other historical experiences of
Page 8 of 21



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2018-01-23

diﬀerences in product and pricing, that there has been a strong cannibalization. So that is
really not a worry point. It's really more catering to various segments in the market.

Operator

FINAL

And our next question comes from the line of Wajahat Rizvi from Deutsche Bank.

Q - Wajahat Rizvi

{BIO 19928187 <GO>}

Waj Rizvi from Deutsche Bank. I have 3 quick questions for you. Firstly, I appreciate that
you have provided clarity on 2018 extraordinary dividend. Can you also talk a little about
how you think about dividends longer term after integrating Alka's business? And
secondly, as the Alka deal has reduced debt capacity and increased the leverage ratio
quite a lot, does this change your thinking about the Swedish business longer term? I'm
thinking more in terms of relation to participating in potential M&A to gain scale there
longer term. And ﬁnally, I would just like to have a point of clariﬁcation. On Slide 20, you
have shown that potential Tier 1 capacity would be DKK 650 million after the deal. Is it
also after the DKK 500 million RT1 issuance? Have you also taken that (account)?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christian Boris Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

It's Christian. Let me start from the back. The DKK 650 million is including the A tier 1. So
that is -- sorry, that is before the Tier 1 issuing. We're basically saying once you have
deducted the capital we're using to acquire Alka, there is DKK 650 million left. We're
using DKK 500 million to issue Tier 1. And you could basically argue there is DKK 150
million left in capacity. With respect to your second question, I think I need that one, one
more time. I'm not sure I've really caught the...

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Swedish M&A.

A - Christian Boris Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

The Swedish M&A, Morten, do you want to take that?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well well, I guess...

Q - Wajahat Rizvi

{BIO 19928187 <GO>}

Yes, I just wonder if there's the capacity to do further M&A in Sweden.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Yes. I think to be honest, the history books are full of insurance companies that are making
the wrong acquisitions. So I think we should always be quite disciplined when it comes to
potential M&A. And I think it has to be with the return targets we have on combined ratio
and ROE. We need to be very, very disciplined when it comes to M&A. There's no doubt
that the capacity has been reduced. I think if there are very small transactions, with which
Page 9 of 21



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity

it would typically be someone that has a product that we don't have or something where
we are buying R&D or a very small portfolio, we have ﬁne capacity to do that if it does
create shareholder value. If we're talking about larger potential transactions, we would
need to come to you for the...

FINAL

(technical diﬃculty)
...excellent business case. And that is the kind of discipline we should always have. So I
actually kind of like that situation. I think when it comes to dividend capacity, we've seen
the run rate earnings of Alka and published those. And we see that we will achieve DKK
300 million of synergies at peak in 2021. So that's why we can see that our overall
dividend capacity will grow during these years with Alka. But I guess the challenge with
year '18 is that we get the one-oﬀ costs of starting the integration, we get maybe six
months of the earnings. And we get very little of synergies because we cannot start
anything before we get the authority approval. So I think if I were you, I would look at '18
as an intermediary year, no extra dividends and starting to move back to normal from '19
and then grow the dividend potential during '20 and '21.

And our next question comes from the line of Per GrÃ¸nborg from SEB.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Per GrÃ¸nborg
A couple of questions from my side. Starting oﬀ on the investment income, negative
return on your mortgage bonds this quarter. Can you put a few words on this? Does -- I
guess it's not the Danish mortgage bonds that have given you the challenge. The same
question related to investment income is properties. You -- if (booking you -- or the issue
of booking you) investment properties up -- is up 0.2percentage point, doesn't that seem
overly conservative in property market, where yields are coming down?

A - Christian Boris Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

Per, with respect to the property side, I think that we are slowly moving into the property
market and rebalancing after our sales in the Fourth Quarter 2016. And we want to have a
target around 20% on the property market. But it's taking some time to enter into that
market.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

But if your question was the return on property, was that correctly understood?

Q - Per GrÃ¸nborg
That was it.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Whether the yields coming down should have allowed us to increase the value more. Was
that the question?

Exactly.

FINAL

Well I think that if you take a sort of empirical test, it would show a general conservative
attitude towards the timing and size and (write-oﬀ) of property in our book.

Q - Per GrÃ¸nborg
I assume new property investments will be at a yield that is far below the 7% yield
properties are booked at. Is that a fair assumption?

That is a fair assumption.

In respect to the covered bonds, we have seen some slight increase in the interest rates
that is giving us the covered bonds development in the Fourth Quarter on our free

No, of course not. Is that Danish bonds and Norwegian bonds, or is this somewhere
outside your core markets?

A - Christian Boris Baltzer

It's a -- I think pretty much a mix of Danish and Norwegian bonds.

Q - Per GrÃ¸nborg
Okay. My second question, the 2018 renewal. Last couple of years, you have complained
about a Norwegian guy selling the unrelative prices into the broker market. How have you
seen the 2018 renewal, especially in the high SME segment and the low industrial
segment?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I guess it's fair to say that the ﬁrst signs of the 1st January renewal looks quite promising.
We have seen a less silly competition in both Denmark and Norway than we've seen in
previous years. We have seen a high customer loyalty in the Danish Private market
Corporate -- sorry, direct market Corporate, slightly more movement in broker Corporate
Denmark but less than the year before and a fairly stable development on pricing. I think
in Norwegian Corporate, we've actually been able to carry out price increases as some of
the early movers in the market. We have lost some business on the back of that. But as I
mentioned earlier, we are seeing other Corporate players in Norway reacting with price
increases. And we have seen a lot less aggressive competition on Corporate pricing in

And our next question comes from the line of Vinit Malhotra from Mediobanca.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

So just, sir, 2 questions, please. One is, if you look at the underlying trend in the Fourth
Quarter, it doesn't read very diﬀerent from the Third Quarter. And actually, the Private
lines of 50, 60 bps is also not better from 2Q. Sir, I'm just curious then, is it that some of
the easier to do things have been done? Then is -- could you comment a bit about
whether this trend should remain in this kind of area or should accelerate a bit based on
all the initiatives that are lined up? So that's the ﬁrst question. And second question is
that, on the runoﬀ, the -- I mean, now seen 3 quarters that you are in the 5% roundabout
range already, whereas the guidance was 3% to 5% gradually by 2020. Is there anything
to comment? Because it seems that, at least in this quarter and even in the previous
quarter, some of the liability side, reserves in Sweden, for example, I understand, have
caused this lower runoﬀ. So I'm just curious whether you view this current level as a sort of
a one-oﬀ which aﬀected trend? Or is it something to be more like this is the new runoﬀ
level to look at?

A - Morten Hubbe

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well if I take your second question, Vinit. And Christian will take the ﬁrst one. Well I think
overall, you should remain unchanged with the message of a gradual transition to the 3%
to 5% range, exactly as we communicated at the Capital Markets Day. So how should you
interpret the slightly lower level in '17? It is, of course, a pure coincidence. But you can see
that we have lower weather claims. And we have lower large claims. And in the same
period, we have lower runoﬀ gains. And I think that creates less volatility than in a
scenario where we have, for instance, seen a 7% one-oﬀ gain in '17.

A - Christian Boris Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

With respect to the underlying, I think that the trending of the (0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6) basis is
where we're actually pleased to see. You don't -- we don't want to have too many bumps
up and down, from our perspective. And when we are kind of looking to what kind of
initiative we can do, it is in that range that we expect '18 also to be at. Bear in mind that on
the group level, of course, you can have more ﬂuctuation. But on the Private line, we're
pretty pleased to see the trend and the rate that we're getting the underlying
improvement with.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

As you can hear, Vinit, we're not big fans of volatility. We like longer-term smoother
movements and not too many surprises.

Our next question comes from the line of Jakob Brink from Nordea Markets.

FINAL

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Just a few questions, please. If we're actually coming back to the question from Vinit on
the runoﬀ gains, I didn't quite catch what you said, Morten. But I think you said something
about runoﬀ gains being lower due to large claims and weather claims having been
lower. That was also the case the year before. And should we -- given that you're now
guiding for lower runoﬀ gains in the next few years, should we then also start to assume
that the DKK 550 million and DKK 500 million large and weather claims might be slightly
too high going forward? That was the ﬁrst question.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well let me take the ﬁrst question, Jakob. It's fair to say that we saw a benign large and
weather claims development in '16 and even more so in '17. Now of course, if we could
order that every single year, including '18, that would be great. But of course, there's really
no empirical evidence to support that, that is new normal. So we remain with the same
attitude when it comes to normal weather and large claims in '18. But I guess we will see
during the year. When it comes to runoﬀs, the fact that we have taken only closer to 5%
runoﬀ gain in '17 means that we leave the year '17 with an even stronger balance sheet on
claims (reserves) than expected. And I guess, by all measures, that is a comfortable place
to be.

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Okay. And second question, on the investment income, I see that consensus expectations
have moved up around DKK 50 million for 2019 from the Q3 consensus and hereto now,
where I guess people have put in Alka. I would have thought it was slightly less. But could
you maybe give us an update on what should we actually expect for investment income
post Alka?

A - Christian Boris Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

I -- this is Christian. Jakob, I don't think you should expect quite signiﬁcant increases on
the investment income. We are a business that wants to run on our primary operating
technical results, where we're going to make our earnings. And investment income for us
is not core. So don't anticipate an increase in investment income. So I would go for the
lower numbers.

On the portfolio. I think Morten has already alluded to the fact that Corporate Norway is
pulling its weight a little bit higher than the 3%. With respect to inﬂation, we didn't really
guide on inﬂation. But I think it's very often normal for us to look between the 2 and 2.5
range of inﬂation, like we've seen in the previous years. And bear in mind that inﬂation
here can also be frequency that you see pick up in frequency and not just the ordinary
kind of inﬂation terms.

And our next question comes from the line of Iain Pearce from Berenberg.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Iain Pearce

{BIO 19522835 <GO>}

Just one from me. It's on Slide 19, the Solvency capital requirement walk. I'm just trying to
understand what the 2 big movements are: so the DKK 300 million reduction in the
Solvency capital requirement in the health segment; and then where that diversiﬁcation
beneﬁt as well is coming through and why that's increased so much from Q3? So if you
could just talk about those 2 things, that would be great.

A - Christian Boris Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

Iain, I think I was trying to explain it during the walkthrough that you almost need to look
these numbers as a combined because when -- once we've implemented the model
updates, it's also taking out some diversiﬁcation. That's one thing. But there is also a good
amount of currency eﬀect on these numbers, the Norwegian currency kind of reducing. I
think we might want to try to illustrate currency eﬀect maybe better going forward
because it is quite signiﬁcant, the movement currently in this graph. So look at the DKK
303 million and the DKK 152 million more as a net number in total.

Q - Iain Pearce

{BIO 19522835 <GO>}

Okay. So that's the Danish workers' comp, DKK 100 million. And then the currency
movements of DKK 60 million, sort of net oﬀ to the DKK 150-ish million improvement?

And our next question comes from the line of Steven Haywood from HSBC.

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

I just wanted to see -- you obviously had a very good low large claims and low weather
claims this year and in the previous year as well. I was wondering if anything has
structurally changed in your terms and conditions, your risks, or your selection process or
in your reinsurance and -- or whether it's just been a relatively lucky year. I'm trying to see
if this sort of change -- or structural change could come through in the future years.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I guess it's -- Steven, every time we have a large claim, we go through the large claim and
try to see if there's any learning points to take from the exposure from the conditions and
the policies, from the precaution measures required, et cetera, et cetera. So of course,
we'd gradually try to make the large claim risk smaller. On the other hand, the bigger
commercial companies are doing more just-in-time production, which increases
particularly the business interruption, the large claim risk. So we don't really see any
structural argument why large claims and weather claims would be lower. I guess on the
weather claims, it seems that the frequency is not very high. But the severity, when it
happens, is actually stronger when it comes to ﬂooding and it comes to windstorms or it
comes to the impacts of that in Denmark and Norway. So we might have a number of
years where there is no impact and then single years where the impact is actually quite
high. And of course, we've tried to buy more sideways reinsurance to capture those
particular years to protect the P&L. But I guess the only real structural change we've done
on reinsurance for '18 is that we've been buying more reinsurance for the guarantee
business, which means that with the new program of guarantee business, we need a
claims ratio of more than 220% before the combined ratio elevates above 100%. So that is
really the only structural change we've done for '18. So I guess we're saying that you
should expect that '18 is as likely as any other year to have normal large claims and
weather claims. But also that we will see a number of years where that is not the case.

A - Christian Boris Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

(Just to add for that), Morten. And I think if you've lived in Norway, they wouldn't feel that
it's been less windy this year than others. For some reason, if a windstorm hits Norway
versus Denmark, there's just a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the claims that we do see. And I
think might also just color this a little bit with -- on our reinsurance program, we actually
have been able to maintain our reinsurance program at a ﬂat fee. So we have not seen the
signiﬁcant price increases on our reinsurance program that some anticipated.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Okay, that's helpful. And if I can just ask another question. In your P&L, where you have
the other ﬁnancial income expenses, for the full year, it was negative DKK 298 million for
2017. This is kind of larger than I was thinking. And I think, previously, you said the run rate
is around the negative DKK 200 million level. So what was driving it this year? And is the -that sort of run rate expectation right correct going forward?

A - Christian Boris Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}
Page 15 of 21



Company Name: Tryg A/S

Date: 2018-01-23

I think that around DKK 200 million is correct. But what -- bear in mind that what Morten
was mentioning was once we are starting to having the depreciation of the customer
relation on Alka, that number will increase between DKK 100 million and DKK 150 million
post closure.

FINAL

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Yes, okay. And is -- and was there any speciﬁc impacts in 2017?

A - Christian Boris Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

No, not really. No speciﬁc.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

But just one ﬁnal complementing, Steven, on the question of large and weather claims.
When we get into the half year or something like that and we start to get the keys to Alka,
then, of course, we will just have a new set of eyes on the combined exposure to large
claims and weather claims. So we will probably update our expectations to those 2 at that
point in time.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay, that's helpful. And if I can just follow on from that, sorry, Morten. Does Alka have a
diﬀerent reinsurance program? So they reinsure -- they cede more to the reinsurers
because of their -- smaller size of their business?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Generally, no. I guess. So the fact that they have almost entirely Private lines business
means that they need a lot less reinsurance than we need. But of course, we see that there
are synergies to be achieved by buying that as part of a bigger group.

from ABG Sundal Collier.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

I just wanted to just look into some details for Norway. And I looked at the underlying
combined ratio has been reduced from (100 comp point 8) to 99% from -- in Q4 '17 versus
Q4 '16. I'm just curious to understand how much of that improvement stems from the
increased prices in Commercial and Corporate, as you had talked about. And how much
is from the Private side.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I can start. I think that the increased prices we are seeing in the high-end Commercial, in
particular, the Corporate, is really something you should expect to impact next year or '18,
not something that has had any signiﬁcant impact in '17.

it then?

FINAL

A - Christian Boris Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

It -- but you have to bear in mind, Jan, that when you talk about the underlying
performance, you're not really being able to track large claim, midsized claims and those.
So it is not kind of like the same underlying as when we tried to really rinse oﬀ the
numbers to have a comparable side-by-side. But there are improvements in -- specially on
the large claims in Norway that has given us some of this combined ratio improvement
that you're mentioning.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay. Is it any diﬀerence in the product structure, motor, ﬁre, workers' compensation that
you mentioned? Any particular that has been dragging out one way or another during
2017?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

No. I would say that whenever you try to do a real underlying. And you take out the large
claims and weather claims and runoﬀ, then you can talk about the mix changes within the
portfolio. But when you look at the reported numbers, it is, particularly for Commercial
and Corporate, really more a stochastic issue, how many large claims and weather claims
do you get. I guess, structurally, we are reducing our workers' comp exposure year-onyear. But I wouldn't say that the change in '17 would be signiﬁcant enough to really impact
this number. So I would put the changes in Corporate lines more down to stochastics and
then, of course, an underlying longer-term trend pulling the earnings in Private lines more
and more into the positive territory. Then I would expect for '18, again, an improvement,
where the vast majority of the improvement will come from higher pricing in Corporate,
which will start to produce underwriting year, more positive results in Corporate. That is
really an '18 issue and not a '17 issue.

And our next question comes from the line of Ida Gjosund from Carnegie.

Q - Ida Melvold Gjosund

{BIO 19788453 <GO>}

Ida from Carnegie here. I just had one follow-up question left. Morten, you mentioned
that you have seen an increasing number of customers in the Private business in Norway
this quarter. Is that also excluding the OBOS acquisition?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well actually, the number of customers in Norway grow in both Private and Commercial. I
guess you can argue -- and the answer is that they grow also excluding the OBOS
acquisition. But what you should bear in mind is that when we purchased the OBOS
portfolio, it was a predominantly Commercial lines portfolio we took over but with a lot of
Page 17 of 21



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2018-01-23

leads to organically sell Private lines. So for instance, we have -- we've seen a growth of
almost 5,000 Private customers organically but on the back of the OBOS leads, if you will.
So the increase includes new OBOS sales but excludes the portfolio taken over. Does that
make sense?

FINAL

Q - Ida Melvold Gjosund

{BIO 19788453 <GO>}

Yes, sir, clear.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

And so we're actually quite pleased that we've seen this long period of growth in Eastern
Norway and Oslo and decline in Western Norway. And with OBOS leads, we now have a
much better chance at taking part of the Eastern Norway, Oslo growth. And that is starting
to impact our numbers. And in Commercial lines, we're seeing 2 important trends: one,
our franchising network has been better and better at selling lower-sized Commercial
business; but also, our cooperation with Nokas, which is larger than us in Commercial
Norway, selling a combined oﬀering of claims prevention and security and insurance, that
is giving us higher hit rates in sales, it is giving us higher average premiums. And it is
giving us higher loyalty and better bottom line. So those are the trends that have sort of
gradually improved during the autumn. I don't think we are, by any means, ﬁnished with
working on customers and sales in Norway. But it's quite positive to see that the trend in
the second half. And particularly Q4, is much stronger than in the ﬁrst half. And it is much
stronger in an organic way.

And our next question comes from the line of Nicco Dalla-Palma from Exane BNP Paribas.

Q - Niccolo Cornelis Modesto Dalla-Palma
A couple of follow-up questions. So on the SCR movements from here, you pointed at the
Capital Markets Day to a 10% optimization. So is that still valid? Also, with the Alka
inclusion coming up. So should we expect the base of DKK 4.7 million to improve by 10%
over the coming years as a consequence of model optimization still? The second
question, on reinsurance, you mentioned that renewable ﬂat fee. Was that a ﬂat fee on an
identical program, or did the program slightly change, just to understand exactly the
dynamics? And last question, on Norway Corporate, who are exactly the peers who need
to follow you on pricing? Is this a market where the non-Scandinavian players play a
signiﬁcant and important enough role to impact pricing in the market? Or it's really the
local peer that need to follow, just to understand how diﬀerent it is in market shares
compared to the other markets?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well I will start by the last question. Norway Corporate, of course, we do see international
peers. But really, the bulk of the business is local. So the biggest players are If, us,
Gjensidige and Protector. So really, those are the biggest drivers of the market. And I
guess we've seen now a number of years where Protector has been pushing lower prices.
We've now started to see -- and in some cases, pricing that was 25%, 30% lower than
Page 18 of 21



Company Name: Tryg A/S

Date: 2018-01-23

FINAL

ours. And we've now seen a slowdown in their aggression. And we have seen examples
where Protector has been out increasing prices. And of course, that is a more meaningful
position to take in a market where high-end Corporate has an underwriting year
combined ratio of more than 100%. And that is why I'm saying that the entire market
needs the underwriting combined ratio could come down, which is really only achievable
through higher rates. But it is predominantly the local players.

A - Christian Boris Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

And if I should take the 2 other questions. Yes. The 10% that we talked about at the Capital
Market Day of model optimization is still valid. Bear in mind that the workers' comp is part
of this up to 10% improvement on the SCR. With respect to the reinsurance, the cover is
broadly the same. I think Morten already alluded to that on the guarantee and surety, we
have increased our coverage. And I think we -- in general, our cat programs and (perils)
programs are pretty much covering the same as they were before, broadly.
Just one comment. I think, Steven, when you asked the question about the other ﬁnancial
expenses, I think I actually misunderstood your question. And I answered something else.
So I just want to correct myself. The DKK 298 million that in 2017 in other ﬁnancial
expenses has been aﬀected by some of the sales of the property to lawyers and on
whatnot and also have some eﬀect of our swap on currency protections. The rate level
should be in the rough DKK 250 million plus/minus range. 2016 was positively impacted
by also the sales of the property -- our properties in Copenhagen, just to correct myself.

And our next question is a follow-up question from the line of Jan Erik Gjerland from ABG
Sundal Collier.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Just 2 follow-up. Looking to the Western Norway economies, it seems it's sort of picking
up again with higher oil price and more eﬃciency, having the currency being down some
20% to 30% from the peak. When should we expect that premium growth to peak up
again on a normal basis? Is it sort of during '18, or is it just into '19, not the ﬁrst, because of
the lag on the premium growth? What would you expect? That's the ﬁrst one.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well I guess, it's a slightly tricky question because we -- a lot of external factors driving
that. But if you look at what has happened during the autumn of '17, it seems that the
actual willingness to buy insurance, to employ new employees, buy new trucks, et cetera,
is starting to grow again. So it seems that the underlying trends will improve during '18.
But then bear in mind that a lot of the new sales and expansion of products we do during
'18, you will get that as earned premium towards '19. So I think we will see a gradual
improvement already during '18. But I think we will be in '19 before we see the bigger
improvement to the actual top line. It seems that Private lines will move ﬁrst. And then
Commercial lines will follow. Then the dark horse is how will the customer reaction in
Corporate lines be to the price increases we've done. I think we have decided to stand tall
and say we need these price increases in Corporate lines Norway. And then if that means
Page 19 of 21

FINAL

slightly lower top line, then we will live with that. But of course, if we're seeing more
players increased prices in high-end corp, we might end up with more top line and higher
prices. But we are preparing for a scenario with lower top line in Corporate Norway, which
is really not a macro driver but a micro driver that we see that rates need to come up. So
don't be surprised if the trend between Private and Commercial is diﬀerent to Corporate.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Perfect. And ﬁnally, your guarantee business, you say that you're increasing your
reinsurance part to it. What is a typically combined ratio for a guarantee written business
when it comes to ﬁnancial guarantees, which I know you are big at?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well it depends a lot on which year you're looking at. But it's not unusual to have
combined ratios of 50% to 60%. Then it can vary. It can be lower, it can be higher. But
those are not unusual numbers.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

And why are you increasing then your reinsurance part of it? Is it because it's even
cheaper, or is it expensive to your SCR, or what is the main reason, please?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I think our main competitors in the guarantee business is really the banks. And what you
see is that the banks generally have slower processes. So a lot of them have cost ratios of
around 30. We are below 10. So our margins should be higher. But the model of the
banks is that they make more money in the normal years. Then if you get to cyclical
negative ﬁnancial periods, where you have more losses, then the banks could have
negative bottom lines in those periods on the guarantee business. What we do is, by
buying a lot of reinsurance in all of the good years, we have a slightly higher combined
ratio. But then in the years where there is negative cyclical development, we have the
protection of the reinsurance program. And consequently, we do not have a negative
bottom line. And that is why you might almost compare our guarantee business to a
broker business, where we take the risk. And then we pass on a very high proportion of
the risk. I think you might go to Page 27 on our Capital Markets Day material, where we
showed a combined ratio of 61. Then we showed how we did not lose money in the
ﬁnancial crisis due to this ongoing acquisition of reinsurance being extremely
conservative to protect the P&L in negative years.
