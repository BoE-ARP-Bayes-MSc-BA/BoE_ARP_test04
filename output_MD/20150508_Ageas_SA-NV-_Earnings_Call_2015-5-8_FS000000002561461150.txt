{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you, all, for dialing into this conference call
and for being with us for the presentation of the first quarter 2015 results of ageas. As
usual, I'm joined in the room by my colleagues of the Executive Committee, Christophe
Boizard, our CFO; and Filip Coremans, our CRO; Antonio Cano, the CEO of AG Insurance
is also in the room; as well as our Investor Relations team.

Ladies and gentlemen, the year started well with a nice set of figures, further growing
inflows, solid net insurance result and good marks for our operating performance. While
all segments contributed, Asia was once again the main driver of the growth. At the same
time, we have also announced today some management changes. Barry Smith, currently
the Chief Operating Officer, will retire as of the 1st of October, and he will be replaced by
Antonio Cano, today the CEO of AG Insurance. And Antonio in turn will be replaced by
Hans De Cuyper. Hans served almost 10 years for us in Hong Kong and Malaysia and is,
since 2013, the CFO of AG Insurance.
I'm pleased that we've been able to prepare for these management changes well in time
as this should ensure a smooth transition process and continuity in the organization. I'd like
to congratulate Antonio and Hans for accepting these challenges and, of course, also
would like to thank Barry warmly for his important contribution to the achievement of our
strategic objectives during his long career year with the group.
After his retirement, we will be able to continue to benefit from Barry's growth
experience and expertise because he will stay involved in a number of boards of non-life
companies of the group. You can find the current and the future composition of the ageas
executives and management team on slide two of the presentation.

Bloomberg Transcript

Finally, you will also have noted our third press release on the new agreement with BNP
Paribas regarding the remaining outstanding CASHES and the related RPN(I) liability. I
propose that Christophe update you on this.
So, coming back on the first quarter results, the main headlines announced today are on
slide one and slide three of the presentation. The net insurance profit increased 37% to
€198 million compared to €145 million last year.
A year ago, we suffered from storms and floods in the U.K. with a net impact of €35
million; while in contrast, the weather conditions this year have been favorable to us.
We also benefited from a positive currency impact, mainly related to our Asian activities.
All things being equal, however, the result is still up, and I will come back immediately on
some of the reasons why.
With respect to the group inflows including the non-consolidated partnerships at 100%,
we've seen the same phenomena every year; a strong start of the year in Asia, especially
in China, where inflows are up again by 51% in the first quarter alone to more than €5
billion.
Part of this increase is due to the favorable currency, but irrespective, the growth remains
impressive and I'm especially pleased that the growth comes from both sales in single
and regular premium, while also, the renewals continue to gain in importance.
This more than compensates for the stagnating sales in our Life business in Belgium
following the lasting low interest rates, and in the Non-Life business in U.K., where the

FINAL

markets remain challenging. It also highlights the importance of product and geographical
diversification within our portfolio.
The group combined ratio improved significantly to 96.5% compared to 102.6% last year
where the latter included a 3.8% from the aforementioned adverse weather impact in U.K.
We have to be fair and indicate that we benefited from a significantly higher release of
prior-year reserves, representing 8.1% of net earned premiums compared to 2.7% last
year, and this is a result of various elements all coming together in one quarter.
The Life operating margin showed a mixed picture. The overall margin stands at 91 basis
points for product suite guarantees, and 39 basis points for unit-linked products. The
guaranteed margins in Belgium were somewhat lower than last year, but this is also
because we realized quarter-on-quarter less capital gains this year.
The group result finally increased significantly year-on-year to €241 million, with a positive
contribution from the General Account almost entirely related to the downwards
revaluation of the RPN(I) liability.
I would like now to give the floor to Christophe and will come back to you for the Q&A
and some closing remarks.

Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Thank you, Bart. Further to those opening remarks by Bart, I will provide you, as usual, with
some additional comments on the operating results by insurance segment, the General
Account and I will give some quick comments on our investments.
First, our insurance operations. Let me first start by noting that the insurance net profit is
ahead of consensus mainly because of the better-than-expected results in Continental
Europe and Asia. Both segments, indeed, presented encouraging results across most
countries.
But let's follow the traditional order of the segments. I am on slide four. Our Belgian
operations reported a net profit of €95 million compared to the €87 million last year. The
Life results are marginally below last year, while Non-Life almost doubled year-on-year.
In Life, we saw two evolutions. Inflows came down by 11%. Sales were good in a number of
traditional products, such as the risk or retirement products, but individual guaranteed
products were lower by 22% due to the lasting low interest rates. Unit linked to sales were
quasi-stable year-on-year.
On the other hand, the net result – I am still on the Life segment, the net result amounted
to €72 million, but remain stable if we exclude the €3 million one-off charge related to the
redemption of the Hybrone. This loan has been replaced, as you will remember, by a new
€400 million Solvency II, Tier 2 compliant note.

FINAL

The operating result remains solid, despite a lower level of realized capital gain this
quarter compared to last year.
In Non-Life now, the net result nearly doubled to €23 million. The combined ratio
amounted to 95.8% and remained below 100% in all product segments. This combined
ratio benefited overall from a substantial release of prior-year reserves, which, in total,
represented 13.3% of the net earned premium. The impact on the result of this 13.3% is
around €30 million.
This percentage is indeed significantly higher than the usual percentage and is impacted
by various elements. First of all, there is the review of the so-called recovery of salvages,
which resulted this year in a positive adjustment. Secondly, we noticed a good prior-year
evolution in motor on the third-party liability side. And thirdly, compared to last year, the
change in combined ratio comes from the very weak third-party liability performance last
year.

Bloomberg Transcript

At the same time, the current-year claim ratio was higher than average in household,
mainly because of the higher large claim, while also in Motor, we have an increased
current-year claim ratio, and this is, among other thing, because we decided to adjust
upward the IBNR to improve our consult level under claim reserves.
Clearly, this is a picture of the first quarter only, with an effect of magnification or
amplification. Due to the low denominator, all the percentages are calculated with the
division by the net earned premium, and the net earned premium for the Q1 of this year is
€454 million. So it's a small amount compared to the net earned premium for the full year.
What we expect? We expect that both trends, the prior year and current year, will
normalize over there rest of the year.
On the U.K., slide five now. The net result amounted to €16 million compared to a net loss
of €6 million last year, which included two one-off: €35 million weather-related cost; and a
$6 million payment related to a legal settlement. This one-off was a positive. It was a
payment in favor of ageas. So the underlying net result is down due to the continued
challenging market conditions we've reached we are confronted, both in Motor and
Household.
In this context, Ageas UK continues to increase rates. At the same time, we noticed in our
Motor business a further increase in the number of accidental damage claims.
The combined ratio for the first quarter of Ageas Insurance Limited amounted to 99.4%
compared to 106.1% last year, a strong improvement in Household, you'll remember the
storm and on other line also, was partially offset by a higher combined ratio in Motor. The
same trend could be observed in Tesco Underwriting with a combined ratio of 106.2%.
In our third segment, slide six of the presentation, so Continental Europe. And as already
mentioned, the net result exceeded expectations amounting to €29 million, with better
results both in Life and Non-Life. Gross inflows also increased by 23%, with good sales
volume especially in Life across all countries.

Both in France and Luxembourg, unit-linked sales were very successful, while in Portugal,
the launch of new guaranteed savings products compensated for the lower significant
inflows.

FINAL

In our Non-Life business, the picture is a bit more mixed, with gross inflow up 4% but
stable at constant exchange rates.
The Life net result increased by 11% to €21 million, with also here a higher contribution
from Luxembourg and the positive tax credit similar to last year in France.
In Non-Life, the net result increased from €5 million to €7 million, benefiting from a very
strong combined ratio below 90%. As a matter of fact, it was 88.1% on the consolidated
activities, and this excellent result are partly offset by a lower result in Turkey which is not
consolidated but obviously included in the results.

Bloomberg Transcript

And lastly, Asia, slide seven, two items here and, in fact, exactly the same as last year;
significant inflow growth and higher net results. First, the inflow quarter-on-quarter. Life
inflows were up by 49% to €6.1 billion, with half of the increase coming from a favorable
currency effect. Similar to previous quarters, the growth came primarily from China and
Thailand, and is a result of the continued efforts to develop various distribution channels
and new sales campaigns.
New business premium were up 47% to €3.9 billion, but more importantly and as Bart
already said, renewals also showed a nice increase of more than 50% to €2.2 billion. This
is an illustration of the increasing persistency of our Life business in Asia.
The Non-Life growth in inflows is less spectacular, but all in all, it also grew by almost 10%
at constant rate, increasing both in Malaysia and Thailand.
The total net profit of Asia amounted to €58 million, of which €55 million in Life, up almost
60% quarter-on-quarter. Almost €10 million here relates again to the favorable currency
rates. The rest of the increase come from the continued focus on more profitable regular
premium sales and slightly higher net capital gains.
This brings me to the General Account on slide eight. As Bart already mentioned, the net
result was positive this quarter at €44 million and was dominated by two items: the lower
RPN(I) liability value, which declined by €36 million to €431 million due to the combination
of a lower CASHES price and a higher ageas share price.
Ladies and gentlemen, let me now provide you with some details on the new agreement
concluded by ageas and BNP Paribas, and by which, BNP Paribas is allowed to purchase
the remaining outstanding CASHES under the condition that they will convert into ageas
shares.
The conversion will lead to a proportional settlement of the RPN(I) and hence, a reduced
volatility in the General Account of ageas. Ageas has agreed to pay BNP Paribas a
Page 5 of 26



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2015-05-08

compensation for the CASHES converted and the agreement is set to expire at the end
of 2016. More details can be found in the press release.

FINAL

Of course, we cannot predict how many CASHES will be acquired because it's a very
illiquid market. And therefore, we plan to publish a monthly update on this, including the
corresponding cash settlement and net impact on our P&L.
I would like to elaborate slightly more on the compensation to give you a sense of the
cash implication. So, if 100% of the CASHES were bought by BNP Paribas, the
compensation would amount to €300 million, and I draw your attention to the fact that it's
a significant and discounted amount compared to the value of the RPN(I), which is €431
million.

Bloomberg Transcript

So if we assumed a 100% success, we would book a nice accounting benefit, exactly
equal to the difference between the RPN(I) value, the €431 million, and the €300 million of
the cash compensation. But having said that, and as I said previously, we know that within
the bondholders, you have long investors and it is not very likely that they will be available
for sale. And we think our best expectation is that maybe one-third of the total could be
bought and could be bought back by BNP Paribas. That was a long digression on the
CASHES deal.
Now, the second item I mentioned for the General Account was Royal Park Investments,
on which we booked a result of almost €11 million, driven by a resolution of some of the
outstanding U.S. proceedings. I don't want to elaborate a lot on this since the settlements
signed with their counterparts are confidential. But each time we will recognize a profit in
RPN(I), this will be the sign that some settlements have been signed. And that was the
case either in Q4 of 2014 and this was also the case of Q1 of 2015.
Let's come to the net cash position now. The net cash position of the group has not
moved significantly and stayed constant at €1.6 billion, plus the €300 million of liquid
assets with a maturity longer than one year, they don't qualify as cash, but they are, I
would say, quasi-cash.
Slide 10 and 11 of the presentation, these slide respectively provide you with the
traditional overview of shareholders' equity and solvency; two elements here.
Shareholders' equity rose further because of unrealized gains up to a new historical high,
€3.43 billion. This didn't just apply to fixed income. The unrealized gain also increased on
equity, from €500 million to €800 million. So we have booked an additional €300 million
of unrealized gain and losses on this portfolio. Secondly, there is an important contribution
from currency rate differences. You can read that on the slide.
Insurance solvency went up to 222%, with an increased solvency in Belgium and Asia, and I
draw your attention on the component, the reason for this increase. First, the liability
management, the fact that the issuance of the new instrument was done for a higher
amount than what was brought to the tender offer on the Hybrone, so there is a net gain
in term of eligible capital here, plus the results.

On the investment, I will be very brief. You have on slide 46 and following the usual
presentation, market value adjustment explain most of the difference in the total
valuation. Unrealized capital gain and losses increased by €2.3 billion on bonds and equity,
everything included, of which €300 million from equity already mentioned just a moment
ago.

FINAL

Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to end my comments here and to hand over to Frank.

Frank Vandenborre

{BIO 15168443 <GO>}

Thank you, Christophe. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the introduction, and we can
now open the line for questions. As usual, we'd like you to limit yourself to three
questions to allow everybody to have enough time to raise questions. Thank you.
Operator?

Q&A
Operator
Yes. Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, we are now ready to take your
questions. And our first question is from the line of JPMorgan, Ashik Musaddi. Please go
ahead. Your line is open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Yes, thank you, and good morning, everyone. I'd just like a couple of questions. First on
your capital. I mean your capital increased quite a lot to around 222 percentage points,
Solvency I ratio, I guess partly because, as Christophe mentioned, on the liability
management. But I mean your capital in Belgium is now quite strong, 205%. So what is the
level are you looking to keep in Belgium? And is that decision will be made like under
Solvency II or do you still look at Solvency I for that perspective?
Secondly is unrealized gains on equities is up quite a lot. So, do you look to harvest some
of those gains going forward? So that will be second.
And thirdly, just any thoughts on this cash that you have to pay down to be BNP. What is
the main reason for doing it at this point because if I remember correctly, there was no
such requirement for the cash outflow on BNP? So why do you take this step at the
moment?
And just a follow-up on that; is it anything to do with your M&A stuff, and does that reduce
your M&A power, et cetera? Thank you.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. I'll give question one, Ashik, to Filip, and then the two other ones to Christophe. Filip
is first.

A - Filip Coremans

{BIO 17614100 <GO>}

FINAL

Good morning, Ashik. Thanks for your question. As you rightly mentioned, the increase in
the insurance equity comes, first and foremost, I think from a good first quarter result,
also from partly, as Christophe indicated, additions of the sub-debt. But let's not forget a
strong component coming from the foreign exchange, as well as the adjustments in the
assumptions for the treatment of the put option on BNP.
And finally, I think not to be ignored is also the strong performance of the equity markets
in the first quarter, which added to the equity size. So these are the main reasons why our
solvency ratios goes up and then also with the equity.
Now you ask the question whether we are now targeting 222% of solvency ratio in
Belgium. Obviously not, but it is true that Solvency I, we want to finish that story in beauty,
but the real story that will count from the second half of this year is the Solvency II. And as
you know, we will disclose our targets and our capital management strategy around that in
the Investor Day in September.
But as promised, we promised smooth transition and no significant change in our policy
and I think that is what you can expect that we will announce. The 222% has been boosted
here by strong financial markets mostly and good results in the first quarter.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

But at the moment, you remain comfortable with your Solvency II position?

A - Filip Coremans

{BIO 17614100 <GO>}

Yes, we do.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Okay. So, Ashik, on the deal with BNP Paribas, what is all the plus for ageas? I think several
things. First, let's take the accounting side. As I said, if we realize that 100% we book this
nice profit, the difference between €431 million of RPN(I) and what would be paid, €300
million, but €131 million tax-free. So it flows directly into the shareholder equity but an
increase in NAV for the group. That's the first element.
The second element is that even though the first operation was a real and good success
with the success rate at 63%, we still have 37% outstanding, and we thought that it was
good to try to increase a little bit. And as I said, we don't expect a 100% success and I
think only one-third. So we are keen to add another 10 points on the success rate. And
frankly, if we could reach something in excess of 70%, 10% be added to 63%, it would be
more stable for the future. And I think there is a good interest in this.

Page 8 of 26



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2015-05-08

FINAL

Then other maybe financial elements is that on RPN(I), we pay something. We pay
EURIBOR plus 90 bps, so something like around €4 million a year. I know that it is not a lot
but who knows. Since it is a perpetual instrument, who knows what happen with the shortterm rates in the future and the €4 million we pay is really a floor.
And then apart from this, we pay some other things related to the CASHES. So, all in all, if
you put all together on the one hand all the, let's say, numerical and accounting element
on one side and the gain on volatility, we think that it's a good deal for us. But again,
please consider that it is not likely we will hit above 10% of success rate in this operation.
And then your last question was about equity, with the €300 million additional capital gain
and because in total, we have $800 million. So the answer is that this won't dramatically
change the way we manage equity. You will have noticed quarter after quarter that we do
realize some capital gain on equity, but normal. Why it is normal? Because on this asset
class, to achieve the target global return of 6% to 7%, so we need to regularly book some
capital gain. That's one element. Then the fact that we have an increased buffer gives us
maybe more room to slightly increase the allocation on this asset class.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Okay. Just a follow-up on this RPN(I). I mean given that you may have to pay out, say, €300
million, worst-case scenario, would that alter your financial flexibility in terms of dividend
and share buyback or M&A-related things?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

I would say that from our perspective, there is no influence. If again, you take the worst
case, but it could be, I don't know if it is the right word, a catastrophic event, in the sense
very unlikely.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Okay. That's very clear. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you very much. And moving on to our second line of Albert Ploegh, ING. Please go
ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Albert Ploegh

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning, all. Yes, I have two questions from my end. First one, also a little bit
related to the first question on the cash up-streaming in the Belgium solvency. I think last
year, you guided that the normalized cash upstream was around a €525 million kind of run
rate. Is that still a level you feel comfortable with for 2015, given Solvency II and given
where rates are today, especially as basically the normalization should come mostly from
the Belgium unit, which last year streamed a little bit less capital of course to the holding.
That's the first question.

Page 9 of 26



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2015-05-08

FINAL

The second question is on the combined ratio, which, of course, benefited heavily from,
let's say, some prior-year releases. Yeah, if you look underlying, to be a little bit critical,
basically the U.K. and Belgium combined ratio adjusted for releases was still not very
good, I would say, maybe even slightly over 100%. Yeah, what measures are you planning
and how comfortable are you with, let's say, the underlying combined ratio in the first
quarter and also in light with the continued pressure on reinvestment yields? Thank you.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. Maybe a short answer on the first one, Albert. One, what we said after the full year
results about the more recurring dividend upstream, where in 2014, we had something
like €725 million, we said that's definitely at least €200 million had to be seen as
somewhere exceptional. So a dividend upstream in the area of €500 million is certainly
what we target. Last year, AG Insurance had an upstream of 50% of the profit. And the
normal run rate for AG Insurance is 75%, which will normally be respected this year and
the coming years.

Bloomberg Transcript

Then the second point, combined ratio. Well, a very fair remark. I think that's also what
was in my introduction and reinformed by the explanations of Christophe is that we don't
want to hide against a very good overall combined ratio without being sufficiently selfcritical on the strong support from support from prior-year releases.
If we look to the current year, first of all, also historically, over time, the current year always
has been above 100% because it's also influenced by new business that in the first year,
on average, is a bit less profitable than once you have been able to clean the portfolio,
but having said that, the current year for the first quarter was in three product lines higher
than a year before. It's Motor and Household in Belgium and Motor in the U.K.
On the one hand, we believe that this will be more flattered over the year because it's, as
mentioned by Christophe, you have sometimes an impact like in Household in Belgium,
some big claims totaling something like €9 million to €10 million. It immediately makes 7%,
8% in the combined ratio on the net earned premiums of the first quarter.
But in Motor, we see in Belgium increased frequency. And we see in the U.K. an increase
of the accidental damage. So these areas remained areas of attention. And we will further
focus on it, with price corrections, with underwriting initiatives in the course of the year.
Also to end with a positive, I think that the results in workmen's compensation and in thirdparty liability, where last year we were above 130% combined ratio, the actions taken
really start to pay off, and we see a very good improvement in these areas.
Maybe a very last comment on the releases. On the one hand, it was, as Christophe
mentioned, about recourses that we ask to third parties that have been readjusted. It's
about the normal positive effect of releases on the portfolio, but there always also has
been a number of bigger claims of the past that have been settled at a considerably
lower amount than what was in the reserves.

Page 10 of 26



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2015-05-08

But having said all these things, we are all aware that this is the point of attention for the
remainder of the year. And we don't lose our confidence in being able to achieve a
combined ratio close to our target of 97% in the remainder of the year.

Q - Albert Ploegh

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Okay, very clear. Thank you.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Investment yield was your last question. So at each call, we give the yield on new money.
So for Q1 2015, it was 2%, 2.00%. And I remind you that in Q4 2014, it was 2.54%; in Q3,
2.49%; and 3.06% the quarter before. So, for this year, 2.00%, and to be precise, you
remember that this is for Belgium where we have this analysis.

Bloomberg Transcript

Some comments around this 2%. First, we have a decreasing trend, as you can see,
compared to the previous quarter. That was expected. Second, this apply on I would say
small volumes, not big ones. And this 2% apply on an amount slightly above €1 billion. It's
€1.1 billion. So it's not a huge amount, and this amount to be compared with the amount of
Life technical liabilities at about €59 billion. So it's a small amount. And I would say it is
where our policy of zero duration gaps plays its role; we are extremely well protected, but
that can be checked when you take a look on the margin, which are very resilient.
And so message number one, margins, all very well. Message number two, we are at 2%
with a decreasing trend. But due to the reduction in the volume in personal investment, I
mentioned minus 22% in my introductory comments, due to this minus 22%, the amount is
not very high and it is limited to €1.2 billion.
Then you may ask and I anticipate for the question, how come we achieved 2%, which
seems high when the 10-year rate during Q1 were extremely low and well below 1%? We
followed the same policy as in previous quarters. So we play variable (0:38:31), which
means that on the government bonds, we bought bonds with very high duration and with
maturity above 20, 20 years of duration – no, maturity date above 20 years and 23 years,
24 years, which results in a real duration of 15 years to 16 years.
Then, we bought some corporate bonds with lower duration but with a spread on this. We
bought some high yield and there were some opportunities in the U.S. and during Q1 to
have nice return and we invest quite a significant amount of money at a rate above 5%,
for instance. Then we had some loan in real estate whose return are pretty high. So, all in
all, we achieved this 2%. And please, and that will be my final comment, take into account
that here, the 2% relates to the fixed income instrument. And so, all the bond things,
please keep in mind that we have almost 10% in real estate where we achieve the global
return around 5%.
And final, final comment, the 5% is sustainable, thanks to the €1.2 billion of unrealized
capital gain we have. So we can safely assume that we will have this 5% for quite a while.

Hi, gentlemen. Just two questions if I may. Firstly, just coming to the CASHES agreement.
Can you just please clarify the actual breakage fee component assuming 100% buyback? I
think it must be 130%, and I'm assuming the net cash impact of negative €300 million is
basically the difference between the €431 million and that breakage fee.
And then, in terms of the P&L impact, I presume you just recognize the breakage fee. I
don't know whether there's a loop through from something else.
And then the second question is just on the tax rate, which was very low in the quarter.
Can you just outline what drove that and, in particular, can you just quantify what the tax
credit was in France please? Thanks very much.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Will you take it?

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Okay. So, on the CASHES, on the agreement, I think that I have already given a lot of
explanation. So I don't want to give more because we have agreed with BNP Paribas of
what can be shared and what is, let's say, more confidential. But you are right in saying
that at the end, the profit corresponds to the breakup fees and the breakup fees, which is
a strange name, let's – to be more transparent, I would say that we settle the FP&I at a
discount, which is maybe more appropriate.
And then for communication, we call that a breakup fee. But okay, I prefer the settlement
at different conditions; it's not a reality.

Okay. And then...

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

FINAL

And then, the €130 million, there is no tax thanks to the huge losses we had at the
General Account level, and due to the past losses of Fortis.

Q - Farquhar C. Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Okay. But bottom line, the net cash impact is €300 million negative?

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Yes, correct.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Max.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Max. Everything at 100%. And as I said, I expect one-third of all of this.

Q - Farquhar C. Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

And the other was on tax rate, Christophe, and France.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

So on the tax rate on France, we have activated some DTA for an amount of €5 million.
Obviously, it's negative in the tax amount we have to pay. So it decreased the tax rate.
Then there is to take into account the fact that even though the nominal tax rate is 34%,
due to the tax rules in Belgium, the exemption of some asset class, you realize some
capital gain free of tax. So all this brings the overall percentage down. So, for our own
calculation and to have simple figure in mind, usually, we are around 25%. 25% is
something on the long term you can rely on.

Q - Farquhar C. Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Where were the – I mean, I think there was something more than just the DTAs in France.
Was that – did you make significant gains on a particular asset class?

Thank you very much. And our next question is from the line of Benoît Pétrarque with
Kepler. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Benoît Pétrarque
Yes. Good morning, everybody. A couple of questions on my side. First one will be on the
net profit of the Belgium Life. For cap gains and impairments, you came in at €56 million
net on the Life versus €42 million last year. I was wondering, what is driving this increase
on a clean basis given the low interest rate environment.

Bloomberg Transcript

And related to what you said on the 2% yield on new money, just specifically talking on the
Branch 21 products, my impression was that the duration was eight years, 10 years, and
that in the past, you have been buying bonds with relatively closed duration.
Now you are buying bonds, if I understand correctly, with govies with much higher duration
and try to maybe compensate also on the corporate side with shorter duration, but better
spread. So are you changing a little bit the way you have been matching your portfolio in
the past, i.e. maybe taking more long-term assets, long-term govies, short-term
corporates with an average yield duration of 10 years, or are you kind of trying to match
the portfolio? That will be the first question.
Second question is on the unit-linked products. Clearly, I mean, it is still weak, seems to be
down year-on-year about 2% in Belgium and I was wondering on the strategy, what are
you going to do to try to reverse this trend. It looks like it's again the market trends.
And also, maybe on the margin on unit-linked, 47 bps this quarter; pretty good. I was
wondering if you think this is sustainable?
And then finally on the Non-Life side, yeah, the gross written premium in Non-Life Belgium
was up 0.8% year-on-year. And I was used to see a much better re-pricing in the first
quarter in the previous years. I think we have done 3.3% plus in Q4 2014, even 5%, 6% in
the previous years. So I was wondering what is your view on the pricing of Non-Life in
Belgium.

Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2015-05-08

And then maybe just finally and if I may on the CASHES, do you think it's a very strong
incentive for BNP to make sure that your final max cash out will be €300 million or is this
€300 million a bit kind of flexible, maybe it could be a bit higher depending on the
purchase price? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. We'll try to give the different questions to the best persons here to answer. So let's
say the underlying profit increase in Belgium, excluding capital gains, I think one of the
main reasons is the better risk, so underwriting result. And also that, of course, in line with
changing yields, we also change or adapt or foresee changes in the profit sharing,
although they are not yet consolidated. All as you know, we always do it at the end of the
year.
The top line in Non-Life has indeed a lower increase, but remember that we have
combinations of on the one hand, pruning of portfolios, where we have really canceled a
number of big contracts that were loss-making which drives the gross written premium
down.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the other hand, in the area where we had considered last year a very low profitability,
the third-party liability, rates went up with 8% to 15%. And Household also, we have an
indexation linked to the cost of house prices and then more pieces used, and that index is
this year close to zero, where it was a year ago, I think, 3% to 4%.
And then maybe the question on the ALM policy in Belgium and the structured products,
Antonio, you can answer?

A - Antonio Cano

{BIO 16483724 <GO>}

Yeah, sure. So on the ALM, to answer your question, we are not changing our philosophy.
As Christophe was saying, we have been buying longer-term bonds than we usually did
and also some shorter terms. But that fits actually quite well with the ever-evolving also
liability profile.
So remember that we do have, particularly on the Group Life business, liabilities that tend
to be longer term. So you can say that these longer-term bonds fit more in the cash flow
matching approach for the Group Life business. And on the shorter end, so the high yield
and the corporate bonds, you should place them more in the individual savings business,
which is shorter term.
So we are not changing the matching strategy to more like a pure duration match barbell
approach. We're sticking to the cash flow matching approach. Having said that, the cash
flow matching is never perfect 100%, and through these purchases, we actually always try
to improve the cash flow matching profile, so no change there.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

And unit linked?

A - Antonio Cano

{BIO 16483724 <GO>}

FINAL

Unit linked, I mean, it's always difficult after one quarter to make very explicit statements.
You can expect these types of margins for unit linked to continue. The fees we get is a
combination of upfront fees on some products and recurring management fees on the
book.
You also asked a question on the inflow, the production of the unit linked. That is flat,
that's true. It is something we see in the market. We do have some new product ideas
that are going to be launched in the summer, particularly aimed at more the private
banking type of customers, where penetration so far for unit linked has not been high. So
we hope to have a growth there.
Bear in mind, the structured unit linked also suffers from low interest rates because you're
actually constructing it with a zero coupon and upside linked to some sort of derivative,
but the zero coupon with low interest rates doesn't allow for a very attractive product. So,
indirectly, the attractiveness suffers also from low interest rates.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

On the CASHES, your last question, the €300 million is slightly variable according to the
ageas stock price. And to give you order of magnitude, when ageas' stock price goes up,
there is a small reduction of the amount to be paid. It is related to the way the RPN is
calculated. And to put it simply, when the stock price go up by €1, we gain €4 million on
the cash settlement. So €1 instead of €300 million is €296 million, so you can see that it is
not extremely variable.

Q - Chris J. Esson

{BIO 6194371 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning, everyone. Sorry, that was on mute. So a couple of questions, firstly on
Asia. So, clearly, really, really strong result and the increasing scale of the business is
starting to come through. Just wanted to get a sense though, within the associate profits,
which are clearly the big contributor in that segment. we've had strong investment
markets in Asia. Is that following through in the form of investment gains? I mean so, I
guess, I'm trying to get a sense of how close is what you're reporting to really run-rate
earnings, or are we seeing some cyclical strength here as a result of investment market
tailwinds?
Secondly and related to that, I'd just be interested in the outlook for remittances from
Asia. I'm cognizant that the growth has been very strong, and I saw that your partner in

China, the ListCo, China Taiping ListCo, recently did a rights issue. And so, I just want to
get a sense of both the TPL capital needs outlook and the outlook for remittances from
Asia given that should be a key source of people recognizing the value of your franchises
out there?
And lastly, just in the U.K. Your P&C profitability looks pretty lackluster, and it seems as
though that the players in the U.K. more generally, your larger competitors here, are all
going through or have gone through large cost-reduction initiatives and so forth. I just
wonder whether – I'd be interested in your views on how you see your competitiveness in
the U.K. market and how it's evolved over the last couple of years and whether you don't
need to consider something a little bit more robust in terms of improvement initiatives.
Thanks.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Let's say what the result in Asia concerns. First of all, our strategy, part of our
strategy is indeed to increase our presence in growth markets, exactly because we also
expect these markets to deliver year-after-year increased profits, what we have seen
over the last years and also this first quarter confirms this.
There are, of course, always effects from investment gains, but the main driver of the
growth of the profits is the volumes grow and, in any case, also the volume of the
underlying technical liabilities. And that's the reason why we emphasize, to a very high
extent, the importance of regular premium because it is building up a book that is
progressing year-after-year and we also put a lot of attention on high persistency of the
business, so good sales, where we also see that we score quite well in the operations we
have in Asia. So it's certainly not based on an aggressive asset mix, but it's based on solid
underlying business development.
With respect to Taiping Life, as already mentioned, we did not inject capital in 2014. We
also, each time, said that we, of course, do not exclude that in the future with continuous
growth of the underlying business, that future capital injections can be expected. But in all
honesty, we don't see it immediately coming in the course of this year.
Then the last question was on the U.K. Of course, the U.K. is a very competitive market.
We can say that over the past years, we've been increasing market share in number of
insured cars and insured homes; where this year, or at the end of last year, we decided
not to go purely for volume, but to put more emphasis on the profitability, which is the
reason why we, compared to the market, increased year-on-year our rates, where we
have still indications, and that's referring to indexes that are published on the market, that
the overall market is still slightly going down.
So, due to the increases we made of the average premium, our volumes in number of
items insured and also in gross written premium came a bit down. But we see now the
first signs of our competitors also increasing their rates.
In terms of costs, our cost ratio, I'm not talking about the total expense ratio, but the cost
ratio is amongst the lower in the U.K. We have, of course, a number of distribution choices
Page 17 of 26



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2015-05-08

FINAL

that have been made where, okay, you have commissions that are, let's say, market-given
which means that the expense ratio increased compared to some years ago. But that's
primarily linked to the kind of business, a bit more commercial risk, a bit more specialized
risk also with the acquisition of Groupama.
We look at costs. For instance, in the retail business, we had a reduction of full-time
equivalents with something like 250 in the past months. So we know that we have to be
very agilent (57:17) in this very competitive market, but give priority on profitability over
growth.

Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. Two questions on my side. First of
all, I was just wondering, in terms of the Belgium Life business and the underwriting profit
there in the Guaranteed segment, it seemed quite weak in the quarter. And I was just
wondering if there was any particular kind of one-offs coming through that were
depressing it.
And then second, on the U.K. Non-Life business. I'm just wondering, are you seeing any
signs of kind of an improvement in terms of the depressing environment there or do you
anticipate they'll still be challenged for quite a while yet?

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Well, on the Belgium, on the first quarter, I don't really underline there's any special news.
It is solid results. It's a good solid investment margin. But bear in mind, we had less capital
gains than we had in the first quarter last year. Risk margins have been a bit better than
last year, but that could be just normal volatility. There is nothing really anything special...

Q - David T. Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

Well, I'm sorry, I was thinking about the net underwriting results and the Guaranteed bit.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

So you mean the risk and expense margin?

normal volatility. There is no real news.

Q - David T. Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

A - Bart Karel de Smet

We should say more of the same comment for the combined ratio, only one quarter.

Q - David T. Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

Yeah.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Yeah. So, I'm on the U.K. If I have well understood your question, I think it's a bit linked to
my reaction or my response to a previous question, is the market is very volatile. We have
seen two years in a row continuous decrease in rates. For us, the past quarter, we have
increased rates. We see more and more competitors following, in Motor in any case.
On the other hand, we see an increased competition now in Household, where rates
come down. I think it's a market that evolves very quickly and that, in many cases,
anticipates what is expected in terms of evolution of claims, where other markets more
correct afterwards.
So, as I mentioned, it remains for us an important market because it's competitive, and
we learn a lot from that market. But it also is a market where we have to stay very vigilant
and act swiftly when things are changing.

Q - Thomas Jacquet

{BIO 4110153 <GO>}

FINAL

Hi. Good morning, everyone. So my first question is on China. Essentially, you have strong
growth in volumes. Can you comment on the margin evolution if there is anything? And do
you see this type of growth being sustainable at least for the rest of the year?
And my second question, and I'm sorry, it's again on the CASHES. There will be a
conversion of the CASHES in shares. So I understand that BNP will receive the shares. Is it
going to affect the total number of shares of the company or do the shares already exist?
Thank you.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

So, for China, the continued growth I think we have to make a split between the single
premium and the regular premium every year; it was the same a year ago. The first
quarter is very, very strong in terms of single-premium sales. We certainly do not expect
that to be continuing at the same level in the remainder of the year. So it should not be
fair to multiply the gross written premium of the first quarter by four. And it's also in line
with our preference and strategy to give much more attention to the regular premiums.
On the margins, we don't disclose this. As you know, our partner is listed and only reports
half-yearly, but okay, again, the overall results in Asia, and in China in particular, move
upwards which is in line with the increase we have in the underlying technical liabilities. So
that can give you some idea about margin evolution.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

The question around the CASHES, so the correct funding, ageas shares already exist.
They are pledged as a matter of fact and they are on the asset side of the balance sheet
of BNP Paribas Fortis. So in BNP Paribas Fortis' balance sheet, you have on the liability side,
the CASHES; on the asset side, the ageas share. So there is no creation. The only thing is
that these shares, they don't have voting rights at this moment. But once converted, there
will be shares like others with full right and everything.

Q - Jason Kalamboussis

{BIO 4811408 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes. Hi. Good morning. I just want to ask you – the first thing is, just sorry to come on the
CASHES; we probably have exhausted questions there. Is the date – what is – you have
put a date, is it – have you put it so that eventually, you can move some people over to
basically start to accept the tender that BNP will effectively will do?
And if I'm looking at the price that you mentioned, Christophe, of €300 million, that is at
current prices. So, normally, the CASHES have traded up to above 80%. So, one would
have thought that a number of people will be probably tendering but at higher prices. So
the €300 million, am I correct to understand that it can be like €400 million, €500 million,
depending on where the cash prices will move, and one would have thought that the
price will be upwards?

Bloomberg Transcript

The second thing is, sorry to come back on the expense ratio. Again in Belgium, it has
continued to deteriorate. And I can understand the point that you make about the admin
costs being in general at good levels in your respective market, say in Belgium or in the
U.K. But broadening that question that was asked earlier on the U.K., would you consider
at a certain point that there is a restructuring plan or reduction cost to be done, or do you
find that at the end of the day, it is a lot more commissions? But if that's the case, then we
are still coming back to the same question for example in Belgium, combined ratio of 96%
for example, if I take that from the reserve releases from the €13 million, €5 million is
more the normalized. So, we got €8 million that is exceptional. You're still at a combined
ratio that is probably quite high. And that could be very important because if you are to be
doing potentially any transaction with the tiers, surely, it's something that will come back
as an issue.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

I will start with the CASHES and here, I am a little bit at the limit of what I can share with
you. But two elements: first, the CASHES are held by BNP Paribas Fortis. The way
transaction will be structured/organized is completely given by BNP Paribas; we don't
enter into this. The only thing is that if we receive notice of conversion, it is what triggers
the payment of the indemnification. So, on the conditions, I won't elaborate on this, that's
on BNP Paribas' side.
Then on your question on the amount...

Q - Jason Kalamboussis

{BIO 4811408 <GO>}

Sorry, if I may say, but it is at their own discretion. So, if they decide to pay up, they can do
it.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

At their own discretion, you are right. And we don't know at which price they will settle. We
will have to see, but it is really their business; we don't enter into that.

Page 21 of 26



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2015-05-08

Then as regards the amount of compensation, the €300 million, the €300 million, as I
said previously, this is pretty stable whatever the conditions. So the €300 million cannot
become €400 million or €500 million, not at all. It will be €300 million with the slight
variation I indicated with the ageas share price, but that's all.

FINAL

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. Then the second question on the expense ratio, I think Antonio can maybe explain a
bit the small move in Belgium.

A - Antonio Cano

{BIO 16483724 <GO>}

Yeah. So please bear in mind the two components of the expense ratio, so the
commission and the cost ratio. When we benchmark ourselves and we do that quite
regularly with peers on the cost ratio, are actually quite good, actually very good. And so
any difference you would notice would be on the commission side, where we actually pay
the going-rate commissions.

Bloomberg Transcript

The reason why you seen this go up in Q1, it is linked to what Bart was already saying. We
have been doing some pruning actions, particularly the larger contracts like the
workmen's compensation, where, actually, the average commissions on those products is
rather low, and also the cost ratio is rather low as you could appreciate. So the uptick you
see is basically given by the change in composition of the business and change in
composition towards actually better portfolio in terms of technical quality.
If you would dive down into the various product lines, there you would actually see that in
most of the product lines, the expense ratio is stable or actually going down. So, to make
a long story short, what you see is actually a change in business mix.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

You find that on page 30, however, you'll see per product line and the increase is, for
instance, in Accident & Health where this pruning of workmen's comp has been executed.

Hi, everybody. Thank you so much taking my questions. I just want to go back on some of
the things that Chris was asking about Asia, and then also a question on products in
Belgium. So could you just spell out again what the FX impact was on the nonconsolidated partnerships in Asia? So what would the growth have been ex-FX and also,
on the technical liabilities there?
And as I suspect, probably the underlying growth has little bit less because of the FX
impact. I mean, presumably, again, we're sort of waiting for all this new business that
you're waiting to start giving a payback. So I was wondering, again following up on Chris'
question, when do you think you will have a more positive cash remittance, so from China
and from your partnerships? Just getting a sense of what you think the J-curve is.
And then, lastly, just you mentioned that it's difficult to write new business in Belgium right
now which is very understandable. Can you talk about some of the product innovations
that you're doing to address that and whether you think you can turn this around? Thank
you.

Okay. I can start with the FX impact. And to give you more detail on this, starting with the
FX impact on the result, and then I will give you indication on the volumes.
First, on the FX impact on the Insurance result, the net is plus €11 million of which €2 million
on the U.K. and, let's say, €9 million to €10 million on Asia. I have some compounded
effect here, but let's say plus €10 million on Asia, plus €2 million on U.K., and overall plus
€11 million. That's for the results.
And for the volumes, you have some indication on slide four of the presentation. Let's say
that, for instance, in Asia, half of the growth comes from FX, half of the growth.

Is that the same for liabilities as well?

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

That's at 100%?

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Yes, at 100%. Insured at 100%, total impact is almost half of the total, 10%.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

It was 34% to be precise, at 100%.

Our stake.

FINAL

Our stake was, okay, sorry. On Asia, 34%, of which 10%, coming from FX. It's on slide 4 of
the presentation.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Got it.

Okay. I'll try to pick up on the question on product innovation in Belgium and in Life. First of
all, bear in mind, premium is important, but we particularly also look at the evolution of the
technical liabilities, so the funds under management, where we do see a continued
growth. Particularly on the Group Life business, where we actually see the impact of
changes in the pension legislation, so people retiring slightly later, meaning that the asset
stays a bit longer on our books. So there is like inherent strong growth in the Group Life
business. And so no issue there.

Bloomberg Transcript

And where we try innovate is more on the unit-linked side. I mentioned that we're going
to introduce a product in the summer aimed more at the private banking side of the bank,
but also with brokers.
A bit more color on the products if anybody want to buy it. This, it would be like an
umbrella type of unit-linked product, where underneath, you would have the options of
various funds, some of them managed by BNP Paribas EP, some managed by us, some by
third parties. It is a bit innovative in the Belgian market. We will see how it goes. We have
high hopes.
And on the traditional, typical eight-year individual Life product, there's not really a lot you
can innovate there. And we're actually not that sad that inflow is rather low there because
of the margins that you can get today from that business is rather low.
And then we continue to sell, obviously, the more fiscally incentivized pension products,
but those tend to be typically lower-sized premiums. But there we see our market share
actually going up slightly also in those types of products, like in practically all the Life
products we are around 26%, 27% market share.

And your question about cash returns from Asia. On one side, of course, increasing profits
should be to higher capability of dividend upstream, as far of course as we can keep the
solvency levels in line. But also, be careful because last year we could benefit from the
restructuring on Hong Kong that gave rise to an extra dividend. So, compared to last year,
I would be a bit more careful for the dividend upstream overall from Asia this year.

Operator
Thank you very much. And there are no further questions in queue. And with that, I would
like to return the conference call back to the speakers.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your good questions. To end this call, let me
summarize shortly the main conclusions.
The inflows at 100%, reached almost €10 billion for the first time. Asia remains a strong
contributor to growth and proves its importance in the context of the market environment
in Europe, where, in Life business, volumes are coming down.
Solid results to start the year in both Life and Non-Life, but we have some certain
attention points particularly in Non-Life.
