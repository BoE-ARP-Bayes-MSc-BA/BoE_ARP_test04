{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our 2018 First Half Results Presentation. I'm
pleased to have with me today our Group CFO, Inder Singh. And Inder is going to talk you
through the financial results in a bit more detail in a moment.
In February this year we outlined our strategic agenda to deliver a stronger and simpler
QBE and we've moved quickly to execute against those seven priorities. The actions
we've taken in the first half, including exiting some loss-making businesses, mobilization
of our Brilliant Basics program and the implementation of the Cell Review process have I
think contributed directly to our financial results.
However, there is still much room to drive further performance improvements and to build
QBE for the future. Let me give you a few of my kind of real big picture highlights. We
have made significant progress in simplifying the business this year, exit a number of
countries and the number of portfolios in the first half, the historically combined and
contributed both volatility and last year 200 million in underwriting losses for our 2017
results. We are now a more focused organization on the markets and on the products
where we can have scale and can deliver an acceptable return to our shareholders.
The Cell Review process is now fully established across the Group. To date, I've
personally conducted three full rounds in Cell reviews, more actually in some places,
including over 300 individual Cell Review meetings in person and in country. We're also
really pleased with how the organization is mobilized around the Brilliant Basics agenda.
We've completed detailed round of assessments of underwriting, of pricing, of claims,
and we're addressing some short-term gaps but also we're implementing brand new
global standards and a number of genuinely leading best practices across the Group.

FINAL

As per the results itself, I'm pleased to report a combined operating ratio of 95.8% for
the half, in line with our guidance. Importantly, I think the quality of results has improved
with a little bit less reliance on prior reserve releases and an improvement in our attritional
loss ratio of about 120 basis points measured against the full-year 2017.
Certainly one feature I'm pleased with is the rate increases. Obviously, we had a period of
-- extended period of declining rates globally, and we've now achieved positive rate
increases across each of our major divisions. When we joined it was pretty hard for our
Cell Review process, and it's not a coincidence that the average we've accrued -achieved across the Group of nearly 5% is higher than virtually all of our global
competitors while also improving our retention level. And the strengthening of the
balance sheet during the half has also been important. The balance sheet improved
pretty materially over the first half, with the PCA multiple increasing 100 basis points to
1.74 times, due in part to the lower risk charges from that portfolio work that we've been
undertaking.

Bloomberg Transcript

Just a little bit from me on the results itself; the combined ratio of 95.8% reflects a strong
result in the Australia/New Zealand business, which has again seen an improvement in our
attritional loss ratio. Our European results -- with an improved current accident year
combined ratio, less reliance on prior year and an improving performance in both North
America and in Asia.
And on attritional loss ratio, it was really pleasing to see improvements in all four of our
divisions in the first half of 2018 when measured against the first full-year 2017 and the
continuation of our improving trend in ANZO[ph]. Acquisition cost is slightly down on the
half, as we managed costs as well as investing in things like Brilliant Basics, and the
headline number of 31% also benefited from the disposal of Latin America. Legal [ph]
contributed to return on equity of 8.9% for the half-year, we're already in line with the
previous half-year, notwithstanding a lower, more subdued interest rate and investment
environment.
While our focus is been very much still is very much delivering much on bottom line
improvement, it's worth looking at the topline in just a tiny bit more detail. The reason I
say that is a few people have perhaps understandably wondered whether we'll suffer
from a shrinking premium base if we implement underwriting review, Cell Review, Brilliant
Basics, all of that.
But as well as re-improvising on profitable business, which we are, we're very focused on
really targeting retaining our more profitable business at the same time. And I'm going to
show you our retention levels in a moment, but as you can see there, if you adjust for the
impact of obviously foreign exchange and the New South Wales CTP reforms, we
reported underlying growth of 2% across the Group. Even notwithstanding the work we're
doing in Asia, we're 3% across our big provisions, indeed all of them reporting 3% growth.
That's obviously primarily driven by rate increases but also strong retention and some
targeted -- very targeted new business lines.

FINAL

Just on rate itself, this is I think my favorite slide, we've achieved average rate increases
across each of the three major divisions, coming in at 4.6% overall for the Group. This isn't
just something that happened by accident though. Our detailed portfolio analysis is
designed really to target the right increase in the right segments, sub-segments and sub
sub-segments and indeed down the quality level to drive overall strong rate increases,
increase our rate adequacy and also keep strong retention levels.
North America, as you can see, we achieved rate of just over 3%. Accident & Health is
particularly strong at around 10%, great growth. Homebuilders spoke about 8% and
property rates generally were more supported in the cat affected areas. In Europe, we
saw overall rate increases across five. Again, cat impacted classes have seen positive
rate, international properties plus 12, QBE REIT property plus 7, but also elsewhere UK
Motor plus 10, international liability plus 5 were also encouraging.

Bloomberg Transcript

At Australia/Zealand we show rate increases of nearly 7% and you can see we are now
getting rate on previous year's rate. Increases were particularly strong in commercial
property up 18%, commercial motor plus 8%, workers' comp plus 9%. And we're using
increasingly sophisticated pricing tools to allow us to target rate and risk selection in the
right areas to meaningfully increase our rate adequacy, which I'm going to come back to in
a moment.
Even in Asia where market conditions remain very tough, the early benefits for our
remediation program are becoming evident with more selective underwriting, exits from
certain unprofitable lines of business, reducing retention of design but also starting to
drive better growth in our rates there. I think all of that's good, but equally encouraging
has been our retention levels at the same time, and actually across the whole Group we
were up about a 100 basis points on retention versus first half last year. In Australia/New
Zealand, retention actually increased by 1.5%, in Europe also by 1.5% and we were stable
in North America.
On now simplification, over the half we've executed a number of initiatives to simplify the
Group. These transactions have been undertaken where a business or a portfolio adds
unwarranted volatility to Group results or where we don't have sufficient scale to deliver
an acceptable return.
As I mentioned, the business group executed -- exited (inaudible) contributed an
underwriting loss of $200 million to our 2017 full-year results. Following an agreement to
our Latin America, the division is now reported as a discontinued op. The sale of
Argentina and Brazil were closed and completed on the 2nd of July for a pre-tax gain of
the $125 million and the sales of Ecuador, Colombia and Mexico should complete in the
second half. Look, I think it's fair to say our decision to exit the region and the deal we got
has probably been reinforced by things like the Argentinian economy where exchange
rates have depreciated 40% over the half year, interest rates are now more than 40%
and the division reported a combined ratio for the first half of 113%.

In Asia, we executed a loss portfolio transfer for the Hong Kong construction workers'
comp portfolio and we disposed of Thailand. We are also exiting North American Personal
Lines and today announced a renewal rights deal on the independent agents' portfolio to
Liberty Mutual. We also undertook a range of much smaller activities across the Group that
also will help volatility in results. So this includes things like reducing our cat exposure
(inaudible) Fiji. And in Fiji, aggregate exposure should come down by about 50%;
improving property risk hazard profiles, I'll show you that in a moment; exiting sort of
challenged lines business, say for example Indonesian marine hull; and also closely
managing our exposures to things like crop prices via hedging soybean prices, which we
did earlier in the year pre-trade wars As part of simplification and derisking, we've also
found some opportunities for focus growth while very much still focusing on margin over
volume. In North America, that included Accident & Health; in Europe Natural Resources;
and in Australia in Commercial Packages and in CTP.

Bloomberg Transcript

I thought I'd give you a little bit of -- a couple of insights on Cell Review. So as I mentioned
earlier, the Cell Review process is now fully established across the Group. Worth noting in
addition to what we do with Group Cell Reviews the divisions do their own Cell Reviews at
a more detailed level and a more frequent level. And the Cell Review process is achieving
its objectives of allowing us to manage the business at a detailed portfolio level, making
frequent small corrective actions as they're needed.
As well as the driver -- it's also been a driver of cultural change in the organization,
improving discipline, transparency and accountability. I'll give you a little bit of flavor of
some of the things we did up to Cell Reviews. And just a reminder, when I joined as the
CEO of the Australia/New Zealand division in the latter half of 2016, we put a number of
things in place. A very early version of Brilliant Basics which I would candidly say is the
much-improved (inaudible) since then and a full version of the Brilliant -- of Cell Reviews.
We also put in place a brand new Chief Underwriting Officer and team product
committees to improve governance and oversight of underwriting and risk selection. One
example of that we've shown up there, that's our property book in Australia/New Zealand
at the time. The dark color at the bottom there, the Hazard Index 10, and you can see
from being a fairly big chunk coming into 2016 it's almost negligible in the first half of
2018. That's things like exiting certain segments, mining risks, pubs and clubs, some of the
higher risk agricultural risk there, and that all contributed to a reduction in our average
hazard index profile and that itself has contributed a much better large loss record
coming into 2018.
The headline benefits of all of that have also been material, and so the attritional loss
ratio ex LMI has improved 6% from the first half 2016 of 65% to 59% in this half. We
estimate some of the numbers are contributing to that, so over that period of time we
think claims inflation has negatively impacted that loss ratio by about 3%, earned rate
positively by about 4% and the other 500 or so basis points is the other Brilliant Basics
initiatives, underwriting risk selection, pricing and claims broadly evenly, I would say. Some
of the portfolio to be the main beneficiaries include the CTP, workers' comp, property and
commercial packages.

I think (inaudible) are sort of interesting, so often where you get the main benefit here
isn't writing more really good stuff, it's writing less and making less underwriting loss on
your less good stuff. So you can see here -- so on the right -- very long hand side there,
that's our actual Australia/New Zealand reported combined ratio for the half at 92.3%
including positive prior year. As you know, obviously we've had a record at positive prior
year for a long time in Australia/New Zealand. But if you strip that out and just look at the
accident year results, which are on the slightly left of that, 2016, 2017 and 2018, and when
we started roughly 50% of the sales had a demand ratio more than 97% and contributed
an aggregate underwriting loss of about $150 million. Since then, a lot of our focus and
Cell Reviews have been improving that and that number, both in the number of Cells and
the underwriting loss has halved over that period of time and really driven roughly 5
points of current accident year improvement in ANZO ex LMI. Good news is there's still
more to go out there and still other classes of business to improve.

Bloomberg Transcript

Or another similar kind of lends, so it gives you a very high level even some of the rate
adequacy what we look at, and obviously we'll look at this in a little more detail. Chart on
the left shows you premium rate adequacy for different portfolios on the bottom axis and
the rate increases we're achieving on the other axis. And obviously, as part of the Cell
Review process, we've set each of our portfolios on this basis and obviously to a
(inaudible) level of detail and focus on actions to bring all Cells towards a 100% rate
adequacy.
A couple of things, it's fair to say, number one, this chart looks very different from what it
did a couple of years ago, much more clustered around 100%. (inaudible) before,
everything has gone a much further left. Second thing, any portfolio -- and actually we
want -- you want to kind of align those from bottom right up to top left. So any portfolio
that is rate adequate is attracting a lot of rate increase as well as lots of attention
(inaudible).
There's still more that we can do there. So notwithstanding all the improvements we've
made and all the techniques we're using, there's still portfolios we think that we can get
better and indeed will get better as we earn through some of that rate increases. Righthand side then shows you some of the opportunity around the rest of the Group. We've
highlighted Asia separately, but actually, right across the Group we've got in the darker
blue cover there -- color there quite a bit of opportunity going forward.
Just on Asia, after a lot of work from Jason Brown and his new team that he's constructed
there, our profit improvement plan in Asia is getting some good traction. We've taken
significant action to address unprofitable business. And as you can see here, we've reunderwritten a number of portfolios there. By design, our 2018 profit improvement plans
have decreased GWP by 26% in total, particularly in things like marine down 38% and our
remaining workers' comp business down 39%. This has resulted in an improving price
adequacy, reduced cat exposure, lower, as you can see, property hazard index on
property portfolios and a gradually improving momentum in rate in what remains a very
competitive market though.
Notwithstanding these underwriting improvements, reported half-year combined was
impacted by 5 points to prior year, due to a late reported shorter claims [ph] in 2017 due
Page 5 of 20

FINAL

to frankly some shortcomings in our claims processes. Fair to say this was disappointing,
but we have made changes in those claims processes to ensure this trend won't repeat.
More pleasingly on an accident year basis, the performance in Asia improved from 110 fullyear 2017 to 103 at the half year.
I'm confident we're taking the right steps to put Asia back on a better footing. I expect
the continuation of a disciplined approach to pricing, risk selection will drive further
improvements in attritional loss ratio, but it's also probably fair to say a smaller premium
pool coming forward means we need to also focus on reducing expenses in that region.

Bloomberg Transcript

Coverage, quick words on Brilliant Basics, I've said previously Brilliant Basics will be the
hallmark of QBE and we must be sure we've got a consistent level of excellence in
underwriting and pricing and claims everywhere we do business, in every country, in every
portfolio. So with this objective in mind, the Brilliant Basics program has been mobilized
across QBE. (inaudible) we've done this initially with an internal team led by Richard Pryce,
who many of you know is our European CEO but also a very experienced underwriting
himself and that's really enabled us to get much faster traction than I think we otherwise
would have done.
We've -- over the first eight months, we've done a comprehensive review of our
underwriting standards and rolled out our brand new stated global standards defining the
way we underwrite across the Group. We've established fully-staffed now, Chief
Underwriting Offices in each of the divisions which we not previously had at QBE. This
directly drives consistency and accountability of our underwriting performance. We've
done pricing assessments for -- in each of our divisions, identifying specific areas where
we need to invest more and improve our pricing tools using machine learning better, data
analytics better.
(inaudible) we've developed a global approach to pricing, so commercial property is a
good example of that. And we've recently hired a new Global Head of Pricing; he's going
to join us in September. And we've also implemented (inaudible) global -- new global
claims standards, as well as saving money there also improving our customer service.
Second half of the year we will be investing in more Brilliant Basics and happy to do so,
whether it be in data analytics, more pricing staff or indeed investments in technology.
Last thing then from me, one of my really big goals has been to reverse some of the
trends over the last few years where the Group experienced an increasing attritional loss
ratio. All of our Brilliant Basics work, all of our Cell Review work is very much targeted to
achieve this. So a new start, (inaudible) period, but I'm pleased with the results for the first
half.
When measured against full-year 2017, overall the Group attritional loss ratio, ex Crop and
LMI, improved by 120 basis points and reasonably meaningfully in every division.
Obviously, we've been at this a little bit longer in Australia/New Zealand and that 600basis point improvement the first half of 2016 has again been a result of Brilliant Basics,
Cell Reviews, et cetera. We're now well into that Cell Review process in North America

Page 6 of 20

and Europe and Asia-Pacific and it's encouraging at least to see an attritional
improvement in all those divisions from full-year 2017.
With that, I will hand over to Inder to cover the results in a little bit more detail.

{BIO 20594382 <GO>}

Thank you, Pat. Good morning, all. I'm very pleased to present our first-half results, which
is starting to show some of the early benefits of the execution of our strategic agenda.
I'm particularly encouraged by the improvement in both the quality of our earnings and
the strength of our balance sheet. I'll focus my presentation this morning on four key
areas. I'll start with the overall Group P&L, I'll then look at the performance of each of our
divisions, then our investment performance and then I'll wrap with a review of our key
balance sheet metrics and the progress we're making on our capital management actions
in the first half.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning first to the overall results slide, the numbers presented on the left-hand side here
are for our continuing operations and exclude the results of our Latin American business.
The finances also exclude the impact of the transaction to reinsure our Hong Kong
construction workers' comp book as well as the Ogden rate decision in the UK in 2017.
Starting at the top there, gross written premium increased 4% from 7.6 billion to 7.9 billion
on a constant currency basis. And adjusting for the impact of scheme reform in New South
Wales' CTP, our underlying premium growth was 2%. All three of our major divisions
reported topline growth, underpinned by premium rate increases and improving
retention. We are maintaining strong discipline around pricing, underwriting, risk selection
and we're prioritizing margin over growth to ensure that we achieve acceptable returns
across all segments of our business.
The combined operating ratio of 95.8 was 1.3 points higher than in the first half of 2017,
but the quality of our result improved, with the attritional loss ratio reducing behalf of
points to 51.3 and the contribution from prior-year reserve releases decreasing from 112
million or 1.9% in the prior period to 40 million or 0.7 of a percent in the first half of 2018.
Our investment return for the half was 2.1% on an annualized basis. This is below our plan
due to the impact of higher bond yields on our fixed income book, albeit most of this
impact was offset by a corresponding benefit in the underwriting results from higher risk
free rates used to discount outstanding claims liabilities. As you can see on the right-hand
side, our profit after tax increased 4% from 345 million to 358 million. This included a oneoff benefit from the recognition of deferred tax assets following our restructuring of the
Equator Re in response to US tax reforms.
Our improved earnings profile and strengthened balance sheet has allowed us to declare
a dividend of AUD0.22 per share for the first half. In addition, we bought back AUD100
million of shares during the period, taking our total return to shareholders to almost 400
million in the first half. This is up 31% relative to the prior period.

Turning now to divisional performance in more detail, I'll start with our home market of
Australia and New Zealand. Gross written premium for the half-year was 2.04 billion. On a
constant currency basis and excluding CTP, this represents growth of 3% over the same
time last year, and this growth was underpinned by rate increases of 6.6% and a retention
ratio of 84%.
The combined operating ratio of 92.3 is in line with the first half of 2017, but as you can
see on the right-hand side, the mix of our earnings is better. The current accident year
combined ratio improved by 1.1 points and the contribution from prior-year reserve
releases reduced by an equivalent amount. Pleasingly, our attritional loss ratio has
improved by 2 points from 61% in the first half of 2017 to 59% in the current period. As Pat
mentioned, the total improvement since the first half of 2016 is an impressive 6 points.
We continue to see improving current year profitability in almost all key products, including
CTP, commercial packages, workers' compensation, householders and commercial
property. Importantly, we're also starting to see a material reduction, both in the
frequency and severity of large individual risk claims. The cost of large claims reduced
from AUD125 million in the first half of 2016 to AUD116 million in 2017 and AUD91 million in
the first half of 2018.

Bloomberg Transcript

A brief comment on our Lenders Mortgage Insurance business or LMI. The combined
operating ratio for this business for the half-year was 50.6%, which was in line with the
50.7% for the full-year 2017. The key credit metrics in our LMI business are broadly
tracking, in line with our planning assumptions.
Turning now to Europe, gross written premium for the half was 2.6 billion. On a constant
currency basis, this represents growth of 3% over the same time last year. This growth
was underpinned by rate increases of 4.8% and a retention ratio of 84%. The combined
operating ratio of 94.5 is almost 1.0 better than the full year of 2017 but 3.2 points higher
than at the same time last year. Importantly, as you can see on the right-hand side, the
mix of our earnings is better, with the current accident year combined ratio improving by
3.1 points and the contribution from prior-year reserve releases reducing from 8.6% to
2.3%.
The current year combined ratio is benefiting from an improvement in the attritional loss
ratio, with better performance in a number of our classes including UK liabilities, UK
financial lines as well as benign large and cat experience in our reinsurance business. The
benefit from reserve releases is substantially lower than the cyclical highs we have
achieved over the last two years. This reduction is in line with our expectations. We remain
(Technical Difficulty) and expect to see continuing albeit modest levels of prior-year
releases in future periods. We're also maintaining strong expense discipline with our
acquisition cost ratio down 1.7 points versus the prior period.
Turning to North America, our gross written premium grew 3% from 2.8 billion to 2.9 billion
in the first half of 2018. This growth was underpinned by rate increases of 3.1% and a
retention ratio of 79%.

At the end of last year, for both North America and for Asia, we reviewed our current year
loss picks and increased these to what we felt were more appropriate levels. Therefore,
our first-half 2018 combined ratio result is more comparable to the full-year 2017 and this
is what we've shown in the right-hand side of the slide. Our reported current year
combined ratio in North America is 100.3%. This includes a 2-point strain related to
strengthening the risk margins and therefore the underlying current year combined is
closer to 98%. Importantly, this is one of the first reporting periods in which our North
American business has delivered a net release from prior-year reserves. The prior-year
release of 43 million or 2.5% is wholly attributable to our crop business but pleasingly, we
had net no adverse prior-year development from our broader property and casualty
business.
At a segment level, we are pleased with the improvement in the underwriting
performance of our program business and the current-year outlook for our Crop business
remained stable. Crop conditions for corn and for soybeans are tracking in line with
production levels from recent years. The price declines we've seen for both corn and
soybean futures remain within the levels purchased by farmers. We are conscious of the
potential risks associated with US tariffs, primarily to soybean prices, and took the
opportunity to purchase out-of-the-money put options in early 2018 to manage our
exposure here.

Bloomberg Transcript

Looking forward, as Pat referenced, we're in the process of divesting our personal lines
business. This will facilitate simplification of our operating infrastructure in North America
and deliver significant cost savings, which will support a further improvement in our
combined ratio.
Turning to Asia, I'll keep my comments here relatively brief, as Pat has already covered
the detail of our remediation program. On a constant currency basis, our gross written
premium declined 17%, as we re-underwrote a number of our portfolios and refocused
this business on more profitable segments. The remediation program is starting to deliver
some early improvements, most notably, as you can see on the right-hand side, with the
reduction in our current year combined ratio from a 110% in the full year 2017 to 103% in
the first half. However, it's fair to say, we still have a lot of work to do to improve our
returns to an acceptable level and this involves a continuing program award, both on the
underwriting side as well as aligning our expense base with what is now a lower premium
tool in this market.
Turning to investment performance, the chart on the top left-hand side shows our
investment return versus the guidance range we provided at the start of the year. We
have adjusted both these numbers to exclude the results of our Latin American business.
Investment returns for the half were 2.1% on an annualized basis. Notionally, this was
below our plan due to the adverse impact of rising yields and a modest widening of credit
spreads. However, on the other hand -- on the other side of the balance sheet, we
recognize a corresponding benefit of 40 million via an increase in the risk-free rate used
to discount liabilities. Including this benefit, our pro forma investment return is closer to
2.4%, which is in line with our plan.

Looking forward, and as you can see on the right-hand side -- top right-hand side, the
rising rate environment, particularly in US dollars, will support a higher investment yield
going forward. The running yield on our fixed income book now sits at 2.1% versus 1.7% as
at December. On the bottom left, you see that our funds under management have
reduced from 26.1 billion at the start of the period to 23.3 billion. This is the direct result of
some of the strategic actions we've taken to derisk the Group, including the sale of Latin
America which is now reported as a discontinued operation, the settlement of the North
American reinsurance transactions reported with our FY17 results, the reinsurance of Hong
Kong construction workers' comp portfolio and the impact of our capital management
activities, including debt and share buybacks. The stronger US dollar also contributed
significantly to the reduction in sum with a corresponding reduction in claims liability.

Bloomberg Transcript

On duration, the duration of our fixed income book currently 1.6 days, as we have flagged.
We would look to lengthen our asset duration in selected currencies as interest rates
reverse to more normal levels. This is particularly the case in US dollars, and you would
see this translate to a modestly higher overall asset duration as we close out FY18. On
balance sheet and capital management, as you can see from the metrics on this slide, our
balance sheet strength -- our balance sheet has considerably on all metrics since the end
of 2017. Our PCA multiple has increased from 1.64 times to 1.74 times, due to lower
insurance and asset discharges, driven by the derisking activities we referred to earlier,
including the exit from Hong Kong workers' comp and reducing our exposure to cat
exposed business in places like Fiji, as Pat referenced, but also in North America.
Our gearing ratio on the right-hand side has decreased by almost 4 points from 40.8% to
36.9% as we bought back around 400 million of senior debt during the period. We remain
focused on bringing our gearing back within our target range of 25% to 35%. Our holding
company cash position remained strong and this increased to our 900 million after
factoring in the proceeds from the sale of Argentina and Brazil that we received in early
July.
I'll make a couple of comments on reinsurance. During the second half, we will complete
the negotiation of our 2019 program. As you're aware, since 2015 a key feature of our
program has been a deep in the money risk and cat aggregate program, which we have
placed with a single reinsurer. This program served us well in 2017. However, a growing
exposure to a single insurer is not optimal and the time value of money is an important
consideration, particularly in a rising interest rate environment. Whilst we're still
developing our thoughts around our 2019 program, we plan to move to a more
conventional out-of-the-money reinsurance structure with significantly higher protection
for cat risk, including lower retention, higher limit and broader coverage for non-peak
signs.
Our objective is to optimize balance sheet protection, capital credit, costs and earnings
variability. While our overall reinsurance spend is expected to be lower, given the more
out of the money structure we will probably budget for a slightly higher net cost of large
impact in 2019. We will update you when we firm up the terms of our program at the back
end of this year.

In conclusion, I'm pleased with the progress we're making. We have achieved strong
premium rate increases, we've preserved topline, we've demonstrated some early
improvements in the underlying quality of our earnings and we've strengthened our
balance sheet. I'm confident that we are focused on the right things and there is strong
alignment across the Group to deliver on our strategic agenda.

FINAL

With that, I'll hand back to Pat to talk through the outlook for the rest of the year.

Patrick Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Great, thanks very much Inder. Just a couple of words really from me to finish. I'm
encouraged by the progress we've made in the first half and I'm encouraged. There is still
much work do to drive further improvements in the business. At the core of this is building
on the progress we're making on the Brilliant Basics agenda while continuing to maintain
intensity and the discipline of the Cell Review process. We could do both of these things.
I'm comfortable we'll see further benefits. It's important for us also to invest in Brilliant
Basics and we'll continue to do that in the second half. This may mean a very slightly
higher expense ratio in half-two versus half-one, but this should be offset by a lower
attritional loss ratio.

Bloomberg Transcript

Going forward, I think there's a lot more we can do on our expense base. We are looking
at our Group operating model and ways to drive further efficiencies across the Group.
And as a team, we are committed to driving further cost savings at QBE. And we'll will
come back to you and provide a specific update on our cost-out plans during the second
half of this year.
While most of our strategic priorities are focused on addressing the nearer-term issues,
we're also conscious of the need to build a QBE for the future. I'm really pleased we're
adding some high quality talents across the Group. This includes Peter Grewal, our new
Chief Risk Officer; Matt Mansour, our new Chief Information Officer; Andrew Gayle [ph],
our new CSO [ph]; and Tim Page [ph] in our newly created role of Global Head of Pricing.
We're also rolling out our new QBE DNA, our key cultural attribute of being fast-paced,
being accountable, being technically excellent, being courageous and high integrity, being
diverse, being customer-centered and being team-oriented. And we do want to continue
to invest in innovation. We've just (inaudible) just recently made its fourth investment, this
time into a company called Jupiter Intelligence, a Silicon Valley-based start-up who builds
sophisticated models to manage climate change risk. And we plan on doing more of
those investments this year.
A real simple close for me; I'm just going to update you really briefly on our 2018 target.
The 2018 targets for combined ratio and investment ranges have only been updated to
reflect the removal of the Latin American division, which is now presented both in our
comparatives and our 2018 numbers as a discontinued operation. Therefore, we expect a
combined operating ratio in the range of 95 to 97 and investment range of 2.25 to 2.75.

need to do, and I look forward to updating you all on our progress.

Questions And Answers
Q - Daniel Toohey

{BIO 16751863 <GO>}

Good morning, guys. Daniel Toohey from Morgan Stanley. Just a few quick questions. First
on the tax, obviously (inaudible) restructuring around Equator. How should we think about
the tax rate going forward?

A - Patrick Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Yeah. In terms of tax rates, so we've obviously got a one-off benefit in 2018 around the
restructuring of Equator Re. I think our full-year tax rate, you should assume sort of low to
mid-teens in 2018. As we go forward, our blended rate shapes up around the low 20s. I
think there's some prospect for us to continue to recognize some deferred tax assets
over the next couple of years. I'd probably say for the next couple of years, a high teens
assumption would be a fair one.

Q - Daniel Toohey

{BIO 16751863 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. And just on the current accident year turnaround in Europe was quite impressive.
The 3% improvement in the attritional line, can you just account how much of that relates
to the unwind of the exchange volatility?

A - Patrick Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Yeah, look, I'm glad you raised that, Da. We talked about this last year, nobody believed
there was any impact of exchange rate -- probably half a bit or so would be pure kind of
unwind of the FX impacts of last year.

Q - Daniel Toohey

{BIO 16751863 <GO>}

Just on the buyback, if you stick to that -- I guess, (inaudible) that trendsetting in the year,
you've said you're going to achieve that over the time horizon. So will we expect to see
increasing levels of buyback activity?

A - Patrick Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

So, I think what you should take away from (inaudible) is carrying on doing what we said.
So, this year it's about the execution on the 330 million we said we did this year. But then
there are (inaudible) capital is good, pleased with that, cash incentive is good, so we'll just
crack on with that and no change (inaudible).

Q - Daniel Toohey

{BIO 16751863 <GO>}

And then just finally Mexican earthquakes (inaudible) that the earthquakes (inaudible).

I think, Daniel, referring to the ATV and for the whole of Equator Re, the Mexican is quite -it was a bit less than half of that number. Actually on the -- generally on the (inaudible) for
the last year, we've actually what reinsurance protection for everything else. It just
happened not for the Mexican earthquake, so yes.

Q - Daniel Toohey

{BIO 16751863 <GO>}

Okay, thank you.

Q - Kieren Chidgey

{BIO 7268946 <GO>}

Kieren Chidgey, UBS. Couple of questions, maybe just starting on the reinsurance
commentary. In the -- I know it's early days and so clearly (inaudible) flagged that budget
increase next year. Should we expect an offsetting cost of reinsurance or what do you
think (inaudible) changes in the market may make them likely?

A - Patrick Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Look, I think we will -- and as Inder said, we'll come back later before we get to the fullyear results (inaudible) specifically when we've got better idea, I think generally it's
(inaudible) lot of people in here, it's just that -- it means here that they tell you really
probably prices are not going to go up, they may go down slightly on reinsurance, but
we'll know more as we go through the Monte Carlo cycle into and September, but - -for
the general market and for QBE, but it looks like prices are going to go down slightly.

Q - Kieren Chidgey

{BIO 7268946 <GO>}

Okay. But relative to sort of the pricing when you took this contract out and obviously
placed this with a single reinsurer obviously on fairly good terms at the time, is it possible
to give any commentary as you move away from that structure to a more traditional
structure, what price implications are?

A - Patrick Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

I think the comments we can give you at this point is pretty much what Inder said, which is
the total of our reinsurance cost will come at -- a bit lower. But because we have a more
traditional, more out-of-the-money structure overall, we'll buy down our cats including
convertible cover and we'll buy some sideways cover, and we'll buy down a bit more than
we've done. But because you've got a more traditional out-of-the-money we were going
to budget for a slightly higher net cost of launching cat and that's probably a good
(inaudible).

Q - Kieren Chidgey

{BIO 7268946 <GO>}

The balance sheet of (inaudible) -- implications of the change in structure. Are we
expecting the same increase (inaudible)?

A - Patrick Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

I think you can probably assume, so to say, that we won't go down.

A - Inder Singh

{BIO 20594382 <GO>}

Yeah, look, I think, as we've said, one of the things we're trying to balance is capital
protection. So what we're trying to do, obviously we are buying a bit more cat coverage.
It's going to help neutralize that. So it will be sort of in and around, it's not a major impact.

FINAL

Q - Kieren Chidgey

{BIO 7268946 <GO>}

Secondly, sort of when we move down the P&L outside the insurance profit line, the side
towards the bottom left, the financing and other costs 135 mill, but in your accounts you
only called out 105 of interest expense. And there seems to be 30 mill of other costs that
have been put outside that insurance profit line. Can you explain what they are? Just
(inaudible) seems to be aligned in the last few years where we've continually seen one-off
costs come through?

A - Inder Singh

{BIO 20594382 <GO>}

Yeah, I think it's a combination of LOC charges, bank charges. I think the -- I think when
you compare to prior year, Kieren, you'll see that the number has come down, but last
year we had some reinsurance costs around -- (inaudible) actually included in that number
for the prior-year comparative. But I think 135 is --

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Patrick Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

We've obviously been -- we've been active in the first half on debt buybacks and there
was activity associated with that, so there was a bit of cost associated with that -- over
and above our normal run rate of interest cost (inaudible). So that's more one-off (Multiple
Speakers).

A - Inder Singh

{BIO 20594382 <GO>}

We've done most of the debt reduction that we set out to do.

Q - Kieren Chidgey

{BIO 7268946 <GO>}

And then just finally on Asia, I know there's no (inaudible) this half relative to this time last
year. Well, I think you took a $10 million charge but the combined ratio is still above a 100 - I think around 109 and we still saw 50 million underwriting losses there (inaudible) are
you saying the current pricing is prospectively profitable?

A - Patrick Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Yeah, look, I mean that's a look forward test, isn't it. So yes it's (inaudible). Yes, we're
expecting to see further benefits of the work we're doing now, with selection primarily
because he's got a price increase, it flows through to better current year accident year
results that mean that (inaudible) this is more neutral going forward.

Q - Nigel Pittaway

FINAL

A - Patrick Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Sure, it's -- we mentioned we took -- so early in the year, we were -- we've mentioned to
you before that we've considered at least whether we should hedge against commodity
price movements in our crop business. Some days we decide to do that, some days we
don't. When we've done it before we've traditionally done it on corn prices. This year we
thought pretty good judgment, probably a little bit of luck as well, but it was smart to take
out some protection against soybeans and most of that number we value -- the current
value at 30 June is for soybean protection.

Q - Nigel Pittaway

{BIO 3406058 <GO>}

Secondly, just on the sort of cat experience in the half, obviously the cat ratio I think was
just 1.9%, but you've also taken 7.8% of large risk losses. Can you make any comments on
that?

A - Patrick Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, look, the way that splits out, so the number that's certain is the next number and
luckily they're not going to remember the maths, which is our attachment point of 1.2
divided by (inaudible) which is roughly 12 billion. So, that comes out to 10%. How do you
split that between the two then, sort of giving you both feeding into the same number.
We're only halfway through the year. It's a little bit of an art as well as a little bit of science.
What I would tell you is, we've had very little cat in our portfolio; because of the money
structure that is really a tool for -- to our benefit. Other than -- and obviously most of that
has been, for us at least, kind of better luck, but also we are doing a lot of work to
optimize our cat exposure. I mentioned PG, there'll be lots of examples, whether that be
in Australia or in North America. So in North America we've not really had an impact from
wildfires kind of at all. In Australia, our cats -- our book is a little bit different profile than
our competitors who've had a little impact there.
On the large risk losses, we're sort of seeing a broad and neutral trend, I would say, in
North America, Europe and Asia, and in dimension we're seeing an improving trend in
Australia compared to kind of previous periods.

Q - Nigel Pittaway

{BIO 3406058 <GO>}

And maybe then, just finally, you've obviously said you've finalized your cost-out plans
during the second half of the year. Can you make any comments about whether that will
actually be additional to divisional target such as North American moving from 98 to 95 or
is that sort of all parts of the same thing?

A - Patrick Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Certainly, we haven't forgotten that North America one. We still have people saying
comments in the North America. Number one, I think North America is going to improve
from its current 98 level, and of the key components to that is cost reduction and that
being a fairly key lever in getting the 98 down to the talked about 95 before. So that

Page 15 of 20



Company N ame: QBE I nsurance Group L td

remains true. And you should expect that number to be incorporated into our cost-out,
but obviously to include that reference as well. Thank you.

FINAL

Q - Ross Curran

{BIO 17605313 <GO>}

Hi, gents, it's Ross Curran here from Deutsche Bank. Just firstly, around investment
guidance of 2.25 to 2.75 range for full year, if you have 2.1 in the first half, the midpoint of
that range is at 2.5 and implies 2.9 in the second half. Can you just give us a feel what's
driving that? What gives you confidence that the 2.1 versus 2.9 (inaudible) midpoint range?

A - Inder Singh

{BIO 20594382 <GO>}

Yeah, couple of things as I referenced, I mean I think we are going to see a uptick in the -from the running yield being higher in the second half. That's definitely a factor. As you've
seen, what we've done is we've added back the discount rate benefit on the other side
of the balance sheet to kind of give you a proxy for the pro forma NPAT impact of that.
And including various tactical initiatives that we're doing on the investment side, we think
that achieved -- that guidance is achievable.

A - Patrick Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

We (inaudible) talked about our growth assets adding kind of 70 basis points inside the
running yield and the growth assets (inaudible) kind of overall performance you get, you
get up to 2.9.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Ross Curran

{BIO 17605313 <GO>}

Secondly (inaudible) you mentioned you bought some (inaudible) put up some sort of
arrangement for crop. But we have seen some dislocation in crop prices recently. If prices
stay where they are through the full year, what impact does that have on the North
American result?

A - Patrick Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Yeah, it's a great question. So maybe you would caution me to remember it's only August
before I answer and coming to today with crop, and it is only August. There is kind of
important months to play out. So far, planting conditions are good/kind of quite good.
That was encouraging. Corn price is pretty stable, so that would lead kind of good results
on corn. Soybean is actually obviously the one you're referring to in terms of price being
down. It's what, about nine books now, Inder? So it's just about still within the average
deductible farmer takes and again the soybean planting conditions are good. So if you
projected that forward, it would reflect a pretty good year for crop if things held where
they are now.

Q - Ross Curran

{BIO 17605313 <GO>}

Then finally just on the Asian book, I know that 75% of the Asian book has a combined
ratio north of 100. How should we think that remediation -- how quickly can that be turned
around or is Asia a lost cause?

FINAL

No. So look, I've done seven trips up there this year and I was looking forward to my next
one. (inaudible) I'm really happy with the work we are doing and how quickly that's turning
around. It's quite hard and it's quite a difficult position. So the Hong Kong workers' comp
transferring of our balance sheet, moving that portfolio somewhere else is a big deal.
You've seen this sort the reduction in things like marine, things like engineering, with
focusing back on the book that makes some sense for us.
So give me a couple of minutes to kind of context. The agency business which is a bit
more than half of what we do out there has been consistently profitable there. The work
we're doing is very much focused around the bigger ticket risks, things like marine, more
complex property and coming back to the more kind of profitable core.
So current accident year for all that was a 103 at the half. We think there's some -- we've
got reasonably good line of sight. The loss ratio is continuing to prove into the second
half, so that we've got a shot at getting much closer to overall underwriting profit. Our
challenge really is as much as anything we are operating on a 20% or so lower premium.
Well, we've got a cost as we do that. Otherwise, we're going to create an expense
problem as fast as resulting in the loss ratio problem. So we're very focused on that.
We've got some work mobilized around that. But actually I think, when you talk about
Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam are major countries I'm much pleased with the
progress we're making.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Inder Singh

{BIO 20594382 <GO>}

I guess the only thing I'd add is, obviously Asia we've had a strong record of profitability. If
you go back more than two or three years, we've -- the underlying business is strong, the
franchise is good and I think the work we're doing gives us confidence so we can improve
that.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Thank you. (inaudible). A couple of questions, you mentioned in your document that
you've got reduced reinsurance recoveries and that is part of the reason for the adverse
development in the Equator Re. Why did you change your expectation about the
reinsurance recovery?

A - Patrick Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

So pre -- so just going back a few years, pre-20s, (inaudible) we've got older treaties
where you've got aggregate risk free (inaudible) aggregate cat treaties, we just quite -took a pretty cautious view on some of that business.

I mean the -- Ross, obviously we've got our overall reserves that then feed into the gross
numbers and the net numbers, some large numbers in there. Actually most of our -- kind
of good news for our current reinsurance structures is there's a pretty -- a billion just
under its limits, so actually it's pretty easy to do those kind of calculations and there's still
most of that limit left at the half year. So actually on the big numbers that count, we've
actually -- that's a difficult calculation.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Also the claims ratio, you've had in -- a small increase in the probability of that equity that - which is showed as a cost to that ratio but the actual risk margin fell. Can you comment
on why you showed that as a cost to claims while the risk margin is in the other direction?

A - Patrick Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Sure, happy to. It purely effects, the dollar value fell. I think the -- probably the better ratio
is the dollar to risk margins and the dollar to reserves and that went up from 8.8% to 9.1%
which is probably a better value attraction.

Q - Unidentified Participant
So that benefit you had from the reducing risk margin actually go through your insurance
profit?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Patrick Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

No, the risk margin, as I say, went up (inaudible) adequacy went to 90.2 and the potential
reserves equally went up, so --

Q - Unidentified Participant
So (inaudible) number went down?

A - Patrick Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Just because of FX.

A - Inder Singh

{BIO 20594382 <GO>}

to look at last year versus what sits in continuing ops versus disc ops.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Andrew Duncan [ph], Macquarie Securities [ph]; two questions If I can please. On the first
one on the European division, obviously everybody is going to have a view on what the
price cycle is going to do. I'm probably more interested in what's happening with volumes
in the context of Brexit. So should we be assuming that volumes leak out of that division
or do you think you can recapture them in other jurisdictions?

Can I answer the pricing instead -- that's kind of looking an easier question. Look, it's -you've got a few things wrapped up in that (inaudible). So what's happening to volumes?
Nothing at the moment. So, that's more dictated by our own approach, which in turn have
been super-focused on underwriting quality for a long time. So trying to keep retention
levels high, that should (inaudible) took them up a notch, which is great, and being really
selective on new business. So new business is quite -- high-quality new business is quite
hard to find. We delivered some, what, US$300 million also in the first part. That's
probably more impacted by -- just is still reasonably competitive in the market, no real
impact yet.
On the amount of business coming into the London market, which is to answer your
question from Brexit, what does that look like longer-term, is it really tough one to say I
think at the moment. You partly got Lloyd's [ph] own strategy that will play into that, what
the new CEO does. I think if they really recapture their kind of mojos as a quality
underwriter, specialist underwriter essential to (inaudible) I think that could be a good
thing. Brexit is just a hard one to call at the moment, but currently no impact on us.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Sure, and then the second question, I appreciate it's in the leads [ph], but given recent
history, some of today's leads is tomorrow headlines, the Australian D&O exposure for
QBE, just interested in what your exposure is, whether it's underwritten in Australia or
London, just to give us perspective, because that's obviously (Multiple Speakers)?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Patrick Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

I should've answered that when you asked the second question. I also should have
answered it on the previous one that one of the things we do in our European business is
we're not reliant on business all coming into the access points obviously for distribution
around the world. In our Australian business, our D&O we write is very small ticket stuff, so
it's tax preparers, smaller accountants, kind of it was not at all big ticket side C [ph] kind of
(inaudible). We do do that -- some of that historically out of London. Our risk (inaudible) for
that now is actually much, much lower. So we've got very limited exposure to bigger ticket
D&O in Australia. We would have written some historically, but in Europe over the last 12
months we've really kind of pulled back from bigger ticket law firms or financial
institutions' D&O exposures.

Q - Unidentified Participant
That's all, thank you.
