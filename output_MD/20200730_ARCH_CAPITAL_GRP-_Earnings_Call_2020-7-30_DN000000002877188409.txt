Thanks, Liz. Good morning and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. On a
reported basis, Arch had an acceptable quarter despite COVID-19 related economic
disruptions. Our operating results were good from the underlying accident year ex-cat
combined ratio perspective as each segment that benefited from the recent rate
improvements.
All three segments are poised to see the opportunities to grow based on the
underwriting returns outlook. Consequently, this quarter rate improvements continue to
enable us to expand our writings in our property casualty units, as we increasingly achieve
acceptable risk-adjusted returns. We know from experience that this environment is an
appropriate time to raise additional capital, so that we can more significantly take
advantage of this hardening P&C market. As we have discussed in previous earnings calls,
we continuously rank order our capital allocation opportunities among and within the units
and today P&C insurance and reinsurance prospects have moved up the scale, even MI
returns improved at the same time. To be sure, we are experiencing unprecedented
times across our world and the insurance industry. There is still much uncertainty from the
pandemic and its ultimate impact. The P&C industry faces emerging claims trends, the
possibility of long lasting lower investment returns and a strain from on model cat losses
and chronic on the pricing from the soft market years. This new reality points to the need
for further premium rate increases for the foreseeable future. While not all lines are fully
attractive on an absolute basis, the positive momentum is evident and has accelerated
through the second quarter.
Turning to our operating segments. I'd like to begin with the mortgage insurance
segment. Reported delinquencies for 5.1% at June 30th, 2020 and came in better than
our expectation last quarter, which was at the early onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. As
you may recall from our call last quarter, given the uncertainty surrounding COVID- 19, we
were forecasting more pressure on the housing market in a more pessimistic view of the
economy that is indicated by the latest delinquency data.
As we stand today, we believe that the US, MI industry has been benefiting from a
combination of solid credit quality of the post 2008 crisis originations to favorable supplydemand imbalance in housing inventory as well as three strong and swift government
interventions to help homeowners. As a result, we are seeing better than expected
delinquency rates, emerging this quarter even as rates are at elevated levels, reflecting
the recessionary environment.

Our current incurred loss view equates to a claim rate slightly above 5% on newly
reported delinquencies, while this claim rate is significantly higher than what we have seen
from claim rates on the previous Hurricane forbearance programs, it is also significantly
lower than what the industry experienced in a GFC and reflects the better underlying
condition I mentioned earlier. Because of the current economic conditions, the credit
quality of our new insurance written business as measured by average FICO scores and
loan to value is stronger than a year ago. Mortgage lenders have tightened underwriting
standards and a higher quality of loans originated is a direct benefit to us.
We saw record mortgage originations fueled by the historically low mortgage rate and
that has created surges in both refinancing and purchase activity. This favorable financing
environment is supporting home prices. We see prices rising around 5% on an annual
basis across the US.
Despite the weakened economy, we estimate that the mark-to-market home owners
equity in the vast majority of our policies is in excess of 10%. The level of equity, as a
reminder, has proven to be a strong indicator of a borrower's propensity to default, i.e.,
the higher the equity, the less likely a default will happen in turning to a claim.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning now to our P&C businesses. First let's talk about COVID-19, which is affecting
many lines at the same time and developing much more slowly than and a natural
catastrophe. Adding to the uncertainty is the fact that many coverage issues have yet to
be resolved. All of this informed how we approached our reserving for COVID -19 within
our P&C segments, based on the bottom-up approach to develop our view of ultimate
losses. Francois will cover this in more detail in a few minutes.
Moving on to the P&C business environment, starting with the insurance. We see a
growing number of opportunities as net premium written grew 7% in the quarter for the
unit, despite the fact that our travel premiums decreased materially due to the pandemic,
excluding travel, our Insurance and PW growth would have been approximately 17%.
Most of our growth was generated in the E&S casualty, E&S property, professional lines,
and the specialty lines written out of London. About two-thirds of that increase came from
exposure growth and the balance from rate. Our overall insurance renewal rate change
was plus 8.5%, up significantly from plus 5.5% in the first quarter. Earned premium that we
wrote at higher rate levels over the last several quarters helped lower our quarterly
accident year combined ratio ex-cat to 96.1% from 99.4% for the same quarter in 2019.
In summary, our Insurance Group's main mission right now is to grow in those lines, where
conditions improve enough to allow for an appropriate risk adjusted return and the
market is allowing this ever more.
Over to the reinsurance segment now. We had very strong premiums growth at plus 50%,
reflecting ongoing dislocations and improvements in the marketplace. Growth
opportunities presented themselves across the vast majority of our business lines.
Property cat and PW was up 153%, while the properties was up 70% and casualty was up

35%. Partially offsetting this growth were declines in more quarter share of net premium
written due to the impacts of COVID-19 exposure decreases.

FINAL

Generally, our reinsurance segment is able to seize on opportunities earlier than our
insurance segment. We are also incrementally increasing our capital allocation to our
property cat sector. However, our PML usage is still substantially below what we could
deploy, if return expectations were to get to the levels we saw in 2006.
Our reinsurance accident quarter combined ratio ex-cat improved to 87.5% from 92.2%
over the same period in 2019. This partly reflects our opportunistic underwriting strategy
and capital allocation over the last two years, but also is a reflection of the benign
attritional loss experience relative to the prior year's quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

To summarize for our P&C operations, after several years of cycle managing our portfolio,
we are well positioned to deploy more capital at attractive returns. As we expect our
investment returns, our outlook remains cautious as we believe the economic recovery
could be slow and take several quarters to develop, accordingly underwriting
performance should be the driver of earnings for the industry in the near term, which we
believe should help to sustain the momentum of increasing premium rates. From a capital
standpoint, we are in a strong position and we have room to grow with our clients after
many years of playing defense. In other words, our core principle again of active cycle
management exercised by our team has positioned to us to move much more
aggressively into a growing number of improving lines.
Last but not least, we want our shareholders to know that our employees' hard work in
our clients' strong relationships over the last three months were critical in getting us
through these tough times. And for that, a huge thanks to all of them.
With that, Francois will take you through the financials.

Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

Thank you, Marc, and good morning to all. We at Arch hope that you are in good health.
On to the second quarter results. As a reminder, and consistent with prior practice, the
following comments are on a core basis, which corresponds to Arch's financial results
excluding the other segment, i.e., the operations of Watford Holdings Limited. In our
filings, the term consolidated includes Watford. After-tax operating income for the quarter
was $16.6 million, which translates to an annualized 0.6% operating return on average
common equity and $0.04 per share. Book value per share increased to $27.62 at June
30th, up 5.8% from last quarter and 12.1% from one year ago.
The increase in the quarter was fueled by the strong recovery in the capital markets.
Outside of the losses related to the COVID-19 pandemic, our underwriting groups
continued on their path of solid growth and improving results as we benefited from the
generally improving property casualty markets. Losses from 2020 catastrophic events in
the quarter, including COVID-19, net of reinsurance recoverables and reinstatement

FINAL

premiums stood at $207.2 million or 13.5 combined ratio points compared to 0.5
combined ratio points in the second quarter of 2019.
The losses impacted both our Insurance and reinsurance segments and include $173.1
million from the COVID -19 pandemic as well as $34.1 million for other catastrophic events
including losses related to civil unrest claims across the US. The losses we recorded in the
quarter for COVID-19 across our P&C operations were split 45% insurance and 55%
reinsurance. These loss estimates incorporate additional information that became
available during the quarter and represent our current assessment and best estimate of
the ultimate losses for occurrences through June 30, based on policy terms and
conditions including limits, sub-limits, and deductibles.

Bloomberg Transcript

We are confident that the approach we took to develop these estimates is conservative
and are comfortable with our estimates, as they currently stand, but needless to say, we
continue to monitor -- monitor the pandemic and its effects as they play out and we will
adjust our estimates as necessary in the coming quarters. As of June 30th, the vast
majority of our COVID-19 claims are yet to be settled or paid, as approximately 90% of
the incurred loss amount has been recorded as IBNR, incurred but not reported reserves
or as additional case reserves within our insurance and reinsurance segments.
In the insurance segment, the loss reserves we recorded this quarter for the pandemic
were primarily attributable to exposures in our North American unit across the national
accounts programs and travel lines of business. In the reinsurance segment, the majority
of the losses came from the property catastrophe accident and health and trade credit
lines of business. As regards the potential impact of COVID-19 on our mortgage
segment, it is important to mention that our estimates for our US primary mortgage
insurance book are based only on reported delinquencies, as of June 30, 2020, as
mandated by GAAP.
As we discussed on the last call, our expectation at the end of the first quarter was for the
delinquency rate to progressively increase throughout the remainder of the year with a
resulting expectation that underwriting income for the overall segment would be minimal
for the remainder of 2020. While we did see such an increase and reported delinquencies
in the second quarter, the current delinquency rate of 5.14% is approximately 30% to 40%
lower than what we expected it would be when we developed our forecast at the end of
the first quarter. While that is a positive sign for the ultimate performance of the book, we
are also aware that many uncertainties remain including the rate of conversion from
delinquency to cure or claim, which we expect to be different than under more normal
conditions.
In addition, it is extremely difficult to predict how reported delinquencies and forbearance,
which represent approximately two-thirds of total current delinquencies will behave over
time, given the lack of historical data that is directly applicable to the current economic
reality, which includes elevated unemployment rates, historically low interest rates, solid
home price levels, and unprecedented government intervention.

FINAL

As we look towards the remainder of 2020 for our US, MI business in light of the
developments we have observed during the second quarter, our current expectation is
that pre-tax underwriting income for the remainder of 2020 for the entire mortgage
segment will remain positive with a combined ratio in the 70% to 80% range, slightly
better than the result we reported this quarter.
In summary, while we are still faced with significant economic uncertainty, our expectations
for the mortgage segment are definitely more positive than what we thought only a few
weeks back. In the insurance segment, net written premium grew 7.1% over the same
quarter one year ago, a strong result given the material impact COVID-19 has had on
some of our businesses, such as our travel and accident unit. As Mark said, if we exclude
this line, the year-over-year growth in net written premium would have been 16.9%. The
insurance segment's accident quarter combined ratio, excluding cats was 96.1% lower by
330 basis points from the same period one year ago.

Bloomberg Transcript

Approximately 90 basis points of the difference is due to our lower expense ratio,
primarily from the growth in the premium base from one year ago and reduced levels of
travel and entertainment expenses this quarter. The lower ex-cat accident quarter loss
ratio primarily reflects the benefits of rate increases achieved over the last 12 months.
Prior period net loss reserve development, net of related adjustments was favorable at
$2.1 million, generally consistent with the level recorded in the second quarter of 2019. As
for our reinsurance operations, we had strong growth of 50.3% in net written premiums
on a year-over-year basis, which was observed across most of our lines and includes a
combination of new business opportunities, rate increases, and the integration of the
Barbican reinsurance business.
The segment's accident quarter combined ratio, excluding cats stood at 87.5%, compared
to 92.2% on the same basis one year ago, a 470 basis point reduction. The year-over-year
movement is primarily driven by a more normal level of large attritional losses compared
to a year ago, which explains approximately 330 basis points of the difference, and the
impact of the non-renewal of a large transaction from a year ago, which contributed
approximately 50 basis points.
Most of the remaining difference is explained by operating expense ratio improvements
resulting from the growth in earned premium. Favorable prior period net loss reserve
development net of related adjustments was strong at $28.9 million or 6 combined ratio
points compared to 3.1 combined ratio points in the second quarter of 2019.
The benefit was mostly in short-tail lines. The mortgage segment's combined ratio was
80.9% reflecting the increased level of reported delinquencies in the quarter, as
mentioned earlier. The loss ratio on the quarter is based on an assumed claim rate on
newly reported delinquencies for our US, MI book of slightly above 5% combined with an
average expected future claim value or severity. That is approximately 50% higher than
claims that we settled and paid in the quarter. This difference is explained by the fact that
the distribution of the newly reported delinquencies carry a higher average outstanding
loan balance as a higher proportion is for mortgages from the more recent origination

FINAL

years and from states that have higher loan values such as California, Florida, and New
York.
The expense ratio was lower by 100 basis points over the same quarter one year ago,
reflecting lower operating costs, including reduced levels of travel and entertainment
expenses. Prior period net loss reserve development was minimal this quarter at $0.2
million favorable. Total investment return for the quarter was positive 372 basis points on
a US dollar basis, as the strong recovery in the capital markets produced healthy returns
across our entire portfolio. The duration of our investment portfolio remained basically
unchanged from the prior quarter at 3.18 years.

Bloomberg Transcript

The effective tax rate on pretax operating income, resulted in a benefit of 0.9% in the
quarter, reflecting a change in the full year estimated tax rate, the geographic mix of our
pre-tax income, and 110 basis point expense from discrete tax items in the quarter. As
always, the effective tax rate could vary depending on the level and location of income or
loss and varying tax rates in each jurisdiction. We currently estimate the full year tax rate to
be in the 9% to 12% range for 2020.
Turning briefly to risk management. Our natural cat PML on a net basis, increased to $832
million as of July 1, which at approximately 8% of tangible common equity remains well
below our internal limits at the single event 1 in 250-year return level. The growth in the
PML this quarter is attributable to both E&S property within our insurance segment and
property lines within the reinsurance segment, reflecting our ability to deploy more
capacity to opportunities that safely exceeded our return thresholds, some of which were
slightly tempered by additional reinsurance purchases. As you know, we issued $1 billion of
30-year senior notes at the end of the second quarter, enhancing our capital base and
furthering our objective of maintaining a strong and liquid balance sheet.
Our debt plus preferred leverage ratio of 23.8% remains within a reasonable range. As
discussed on the prior call, we paused our share repurchase activity since the start of the
pandemic and we do not expect to repurchase shares for the remainder of 2020. At US
MI, our capital position remains strong with our PMIERs sufficiency ratio at 161% at the end
of June, which reflects the coverage afforded by a Bellemeade mortgage insurance link
notes.
In late June, we were able to obtain $528 million of coverage on our in-force book for the
second half of 2019. Our ability to execute this transaction highlights the credit quality of
our in-force book and the further protects our balance sheet, should an extreme tail event
materialize. The Bellemeade structures provide approximately $3.1 billion of aggregate
reinsurance coverage at June 30, 2020.
With these introductory comments, we are now prepared to take your questions.

Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Elyse Greenspan with
Wells Fargo.

FINAL

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi, thanks, good morning. My first question on the property casualty side, you guys seem
pretty optimistic and saw, started to see -- saw continuation of pretty good growth in the
quarter and so if you guys don't disclose on the capital supporting on your property
casualty versus the mortgage business, but if we're sitting outside the company, and we
just want to get a sense of the opportunity at hand and the capital that you have, given
the recent, that rate could you potentially if there really is a strong market, double the size
of your insurance book of business on your current capital base.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

I think it's a fair assessment. I think in general, you could think of capital allocation on
premiums from the P&C as a one-to-one that sort of gives you a range for capital usage.
But certainly the ability is there I would say that this is also informed by how you develop a
dry lease if you property cat is a different in capital -- capital requirements and then other
lines of business such as quota share or let's say, on the reinsurance side on liability. So
there is a lot -- there's plenty of room for us to grow.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Great. And then on the mortgage side of things, you guys see some pretty helpful color
that the current delinquency rate is about 30% to 40% lower than where you thought it
would have been. So as you set the new guide for the outlook for the underwriting -positive underwriting mortgage income for the rest of the year and that 70% to 80%
combined ratio, can you give us a sense of where you expect delinquency rates to trend
in the third and the fourth quarter.

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

Well, we don't really -- we had -- the quarterly movements are a bit harder to predict, but I
mean we had forecasted last quarter, somewhere around a 10% or so delinquency rate
by the end of the year. We think -- right now, we're thinking it will be more like around 8%.
So obviously, we're monitoring weekly and we get data that comes in from all our
services, etc. But that's kind of where we're at, there is about 8% delinquency rate by the
end of the year.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yeah. I think to add to this Elyse, I would -- to add to this Elyse, I would say that this is, it's
one-quarter data point, so it will take us -- we still take a longer-term view and fully all
reflecting in order, the decrease or the lesser delinquency that we had, right before what
we expected, while you got you got 30 to 40 and then as Francois told 20% decrease, I
still use sort of a level, so we're thoughtful and measured in the way we want to
recognize any immediate improvement.

FINAL

That's helpful. And then my last question, you guys had pointed to the severity per claim. I
believe you said was about 50% higher than from the claims are settled in the quarter,
just given on the higher housing values, I believe. If I look in your supplement on the
mortgage page, the average case reserve per default went down to [ph]6.9000 in the
quarter and it had been 40.4, why would that number have gone down, if you're actually
setting up more for the current plan. I'm just trying to reconcile those numbers.

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

Yeah. The average is very much a function of the percentage of the delinquencies that
are effectively in early stages of delinquency. So if you think of all these newly reported
delinquencies in the quarter, they carry again effectively a 5% or so claim rate versus the
older stage delinquencies and the percentages go up as the more mature, the later
stage of mature delinquencies we have. So it's really, there is no changes in assumptions,
I'd say it's really just the way the mix of the portfolio or the mix of the delinquencies that
we currently have changes over time. And this was really as you know, the first quarter
where we had a large surge of the delinquencies coming from the pandemic.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks. I appreciate all the color.

You're welcome.

Our next question comes from Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse.

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Hey, good morning. I guess, sticking with MI. So clearly, there feels like there is some
conservatism kind of built in it, you expect the delinquency rate to continue moving north,
is the -- is the government stimulus kind of a big X- factor in terms of like how the $600
weekly unemployment insurance subsidy whether that continues are not, just trying to
think about or I mean, we can just -- should we just broadly be looking at unemployment
levels as well. Just trying to think about how to gauge because clearly results have been
good so far, much better than expected, which is great.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

So, Mike, I think the easy question is unemployment matters, it is a contributing factor that
would precipitate if you will, it delinquency and in claims ultimately, the number one, the
leading indicator, as I said in my notes that will tell you whether it is no a heightened
increased risk of delinquencies is really the house price index. So the extent that the
house prices are stable, it'll keep on going up or that there is, which is another way to say
as long as there is reasonable amount of equity in the house, we have some of the
borrowers do not tend to walk away from their obligation the mortgages, I know. So if you
-- if you saw the great financial crisis. What happened is we had a combination of house
Page 9 of 25



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2020-07-30

FINAL

price decrease and unemployment, so we sort of contributed to the acceleration and
more of an acute delinquency rate that we saw in the great financial crisis, which we are
not seeing right now.
So what we are focusing are, of course, we look at what the government is doing, that's
going to be helpful and I think we'll see more of this impact at the end of the forbearance
period, but for now the house price index is extremely encouraging to us and really is a
leading indicator on the propensity for homeowners to default.

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Okay. That makes sense and that's helpful. Then in terms of, get a number of questions
about the court cases in the United Kingdom. The FCAs kind of been writing about, about
that -- is that contemplated in your COVID IBNR, whether those court cases go for or
against the industry.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yeah. We've taken a conservative approach and we actually had reserved for it as the end
of March. So we have reserve for it appropriately with a fairly -- a good level of
reinsurance against it. So we're pretty much reserved there. If -- we can -- hopefully, it
could be good news going forward for us there.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Okay. And just lastly, quickly, I'm sure all the people will ask about kind of the segments.
Any thoughts on new capital entering the broader insurance and reinsurance
marketplaces, do you feel that capital will continue to or is it having an impact on your
ability to play offense at this point or is it still just a drop in the bucket, any color would be
helpful. Thanks.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

So Mike, it's a little bit of everything you mentioned, I would say that the capital needs that
are out there that we see in terms of clients and trying to find solutions and towers of
coverage is needing a place, a new place, a new home, we would need a significant
amount of capital to neutralize that impact if you will.
So we're seeing actually acceleration, even though there are -- there is more capital being
raised and new entrants as we speak, thinking about coming in. We are not seeing any
being of the rate pressure that we see right now and I think the demand for capital are
pretty, pretty high. There is a couple of large players that were really providing a lot of
capacity, acute capacity in very, very high capacity mongers in the industry, pulled out
significantly. So that means that there is a lot of -- lot of other capital that needs to find its
way around to support it. So I would say that we are not seeing, we hear what's out there,
what's happening, we're encouraged by, we raise some more capital and other folks such
as ourselves and we have access to the business, access to the clients and relationships,
we are able to raise capital and it bodes well for the health of those companies, but any
new entrants, you know it will take them a while to get ramped up and nothing is

Our next question comes from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning everybody. First question -- first question on MI and then a couple on
the COVID losses. So at MI, I haven't really seen any significant pullback from that market.
So I guess should I take that to mean that even with all the COVID economic uncertainty,
you still view it as a pretty attractive business?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. It is still very attractive. I would even argue Yaron that the production in the second
quarter and as we speak, is actually better than it was six months or a year ago. We are
well known -- there's been rate pressures and offer quality of underwriting, quality of the
originations, is a lot better than it was even a year ago.
So, yes, there is a lot more activity and the activity Yaron to be fair, is also driven by the
refinancing market right, which was not there and by dropping the mortgage rate below
3% that does create more business back into the market. As a result of that, there is a lot
of prepay, right there is a higher level of -- the lower level of persistency, which means
that there is more churn, if you will, in the portfolio of business.
So I think it's just a reflection of people coming out of their, their current, they're coming
out of their higher mortgage rate and it's just refinancing the other low level, which totally
makes economic sense that we are on the receiving end to grow. That's why we have
such we believe in a much higher NIW than otherwise would have been in the more stable
marketplace.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Got it. That's helpful. And then with regards to the COVID losses, maybe a couple of
questions there. One, when you talk about IBNR, do you include only events or losses
from events that have already occurred or do you also include events in the future that
are probable -- very probable to occur.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Well, I mean that's a -- I mean, good question, which as you know people are I think
companies are maybe answering that, I don't say differently, but I think the word we have
to be careful with how we use the words. Right. So I'd say no question that we can only
reserve for incidents or occurrences that have happened before June 30th.
Page 11 of 25

FINAL

I mean that's under GAAP and anybody that tells you they're reserving for occurrences
that are going to happen in the third or fourth quarter, I just don't know how you can do
that. What we have done is set, again a high level, I think a prudent level of IBNR on both
insurance and reinsurance on things that we know happened or think have happened,
right.
I mean the whole concept of IBNR, so we have certain claims that have been reported.
We don't know and certainly, when you get into structures or when you're in a nexus
position, you are somewhat making a judgment on whether that the claim will attach in
your layer, etc., and that's where that there is a bit more -- there's a bit of art that goes on
and not necessarily tons of data science around it. So I think the answer to us is we
reserve for everything through June 30 and what we would say has had ultimate right, so
the truly our best estimate of what we think the exposure is and that's where we are. I
mean we can't really do more than that at this point, given the accounting rules and
guidelines.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Got it. And then final question, also with regards to COVID, between first quarter and
second quarter, the increase in loss and COVID losses, is some of that coming from IBNRs
that you had already set up in 1Q, but then took a second look and realize they need to
be higher or is that from really new lines of business and -- newer areas that had not been
not previously reserved for.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Well, I think a bit of both, I mean I would say on the insurance side for example like Q1, we
had reserved primarily in said IBNR, primarily in our international book because again back
to that in the UK in particular property book or regional property book there we were of
the opinion that there was exposure there and we took action and we booked IBNR on
that. I'd say in the second quarter, for example, we booked and I mentioned it on national
accounts, that's where we have Workers' Comp exposure. Again, if you want to be very
technical, at one point, I mean the -- the occurrences hadn't happen at the end of March,
they started to take place especially with healthcare workers as an example, in April and
May. So, that's when we -- that's what we reserved for in the second quarter.
I'd say on the reinsurance side, it's a bit -- it's a bit murkier, it's not -- we're somewhat at
the mercy or have to have discussions with our teams and on the property cat book, for
example, we had booked a little bit of IBNR at the end of Q1, but through additional
discussions and investigations and file reviews in the second quarter, we booked a bit
more on that front and the same is true in trade credit. So hopefully that answers it, but
it's a bit of both, I'd say.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

That is helpful. Maybe one other one if I could sneak it in. On the BI front in reinsurance,
the increases in COVID loss that you're reserving for today, are those coming more from
international accounts or more from the US.

Correct. More international. Absolutely. As you know, we have exposure, I mean in all
continental, Europe in particular there is France, there are certain countries where the BI
coverage is more implicit and provided by the primary policies, so those are some of the
examples that we are policies that we are treaty that we're reserving for at this point.

Can we talk a little bit about July and how it compares noticing for mortgage defaults?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Could you repeat the question please, Josh.

Q - Joshua Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Can we talk about compare May, June, July of you receiving notices for forbearance
and defaults.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yeah. I think no we've -- I think the one place -- the thing that we could say, I mean it's the
data is probably lagging a little bit from our perspective, but the good want to look at is
the, the information Black Knight, I think and the NBA's providing information as to what is
their estimates surveying the market and their clients as to who and what's the
forbearance percentage, I think it was pretty much plateauing as we got into -- towards
the end of May, into June and through the second -- first or second week of July and it's
gotten down since then. So we are about 6.1% based on that metric in percent of
forbearance from the GSE portfolio from the industry data and now it's at 5.49% as of July
13th, I believe this last week.
So we've seen a decrease right now Josh, whether it continues that way or goes back up
again. As you know, a lot of people pay on the first of the month, then we'll probably have
more information and the clear picture as to what August -- July looks like in the middle of
August.

Q - Joshua Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yeah. I think -- I think it does. It has had an impact, I think when we talk about cycle
management, we also were doing it possibly a little bit more under the radar screen in
the MI. I think that our RateStar approach with all the parameters actually took us away
from from a higher than 95 LTV, higher DTIs in certain geographical areas, so yes, we do
believe if we adjust for all the variation, I mean it's not a huge differential, but there is a
slight -- a slight improvement or a slight difference going to our advantage in terms of our
delinquencies, based on our portfolio and the risk that we underwrote for the last 4-5
years.

Our next question comes from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research.

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Hey, thanks, I appreciate the MI guidance, I realize all of this is like literally impossible to
nail down, but I'll go ahead and I'll push on it a little bit more because it is interesting. So
when you think about the full-year delinquency rate, in your mind, what are you thinking
the percentage of forbearance is there going to be or I think you said more than 8%, how
much of that is forbearance versus what you think of is like a real delinquency.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

While the forbearance, that we will declare -- that we will report -- that we are reporting to
you our delinquencies by definition, right. So it's very hard to see, I know what you are
asking and I think the one thing that we will tell you about projecting forbearance rates
Page 14 of 25



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2020-07-30

and delinquency rates in this forbearance world is that data is very hard to get and it's
lagging a fair amount, so very difficult for us to tell you.

FINAL

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

And I guess my follow up to is how you planning on treating these delinquencies as they
age, like you are obviously using a pretty conservative incidents rate of 5% and as those
move into the -- as those age to six months or whatever, like are you going to keep it at
5% or are you going to, you're going to assume something bigger than that.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I think there are two moving parts of that 5%, Ryan, one is the -- it comes up really as our
pre-COVID NODs to ultimate, which was 7.9 and we gave a discount about 33% haircut by
virtue of being a forbearance, so as we move forward, that 7.9% which is a claim that's
age three months versus the claim that's age two years or nine months, even though it's
a forbearance, we might have to increase those rates, but at the same time if the
forbearance programs are getting better, we might -- we might give a bit more discount
or less discounts. So it's a really, really -- and you're right, you just pointed at the
beginning of your comment, I think I should've probably let you answer your own question,
which is -- it's pretty much impossible to answer at this point in time. But right and the
fourth -- and we have -- all we have is a 7.9 pre-COVID ultimate NOD that we sort of
starting point, getting some discount recognizing that the regular forbearance program
on the Hurricanes, which it is not right now, it's as low as 2%.
So we're trying to find our way around that environment, also recognizing that the
delinquencies out of this crisis, this COVID-19 will be longer to resolve, because the
forbearance program as we all know will last for 12 months. So it's going to be, it's going
to take us a while to really understand the underlying fundamental characteristics of those
risks and to add all this to all of this, if that wasn't enough, we'll have remediation
programs put in place of the GSEs, which presumably should help with tremendous
amount, but again it remains very early to say.

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Understood. And then lastly, Morin, this is purely hypothetical, but if you're at a $1 of

primary insurance, is there a clear preference for which one you'd allocate it to?

Man, say it to me, you're asking me to choose among my kids, you know, I got three kids
that I love dearly. I would split it in three, three ways or which we -- I would like to know, I
mean to me -- to me, it all or nothing, but I do believe right now at this point in time, which
is I think what you're getting into which I mentioned in my comments, the returns on the
reinsurance are quicker to a high level, the quicker, but in terms of value creation over a
longest time, insurance will get there and get traction, it just takes a longer time to
accumulate business at a higher level.
So, but the problem with the reinsurance, it's great for couple of years, but then you
might lose that business, so it's not -- it's not an all or nothing kind of situation, I wouldn't
want to go that's the all in reinsurance, even though they have higher ROEs sooner at the
cost of losing long-term value creation from the insurance unit.

Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Thank you. I wanted to follow up on that question. But in a different direction, you talked
about reinsurance maybe recovering faster than insurance, how is the current harding
cycle playing out in terms of speed relative to past cycles, is there any observable
difference?

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

Not really. I would say that -- we might -- when we had that discussion before, a hard
market never happens overnight, it takes five signal, two-three quarters losses have to
develop, management team have to figure out what they want to do and put pressure on
their underwriting team, so it's no, it's not -- it's not unlike others there that we've seen
before. I would say that we were going to a strengthening of the market conditions, even
before COVID-19. I think the COVID is probably accelerating the reaction and the
willingness and the bullness that we see in the underwriting teams around the industry,
but there are still pockets Meyer, where people seem to be a little bit aloof in what's
going around and these are the areas we're not, we're not growing as much as we
should, but I know every cycle turn is different, but I'm not seeing significant difference. It
does take up and one thing I will tell you, the one thing about this one is that that we have
yet to see is the one-one renewal and reinsurance is a really important renewal date. So
we'll have a lot more sense as to how quickly and how reactive the market will be as we
head into this one.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. No, that's very helpful. Thank you. In the past, we've been, I guess, targeting
improvements within insurance that would get to 95% combined, and when we look
through the lens of current pricing, Is there an update in terms of what that 95 can
become?

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

I hope it's lower, but all kidding aside, Meyer, I think that the the 95 was put in place as an
aspirational number two, three years ago now, two years ago now in an interest
environment that was different. So I think right now what we're pricing it through, this was
sort of an aspirational as a guiding sort of the target for Insurance Group.
I think right now, what we're seeing is we're going through every different lines of
business and business units and attributing capital and return on investment and we're
pitching everything to get to the right level. So 95 is an over-simplistic way of looking at
this, but all things being equal, I think I would expect it to be lower right for the industry
and that's also why you'll probably see a bit more pressure on the pricing around us in the
industry.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Perfect. And then final question, if I can, just in terms of whether you had to taking
into account, whether it's COVID or something like that that's so remote or other
pressures whether you've dialed up your overall loss trend numbers in insurance or reinsurance.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Not in a meaningful way, I think, I mean, we've been pretty cautious and I think I've been -I'd say realistic about what the loss trends have been and what we expect them to be
going forward. As you know, we haven't relied exclusively on kind of the last 5 or 10 years
of data, we superimposed our own views on what a more normalized view of loss trends
is or should be and I think we're still very comfortable with where we were at and
recognizing that yes COVID, it is a bit of an outlier, but at this point, haven't really factored
in any material changes in our loss trends in how we price the business.

any benefit at all in the quarter from just lower frequency of economic activity kind of from

Page 17 of 25

a claims perspective in any lines of business?

FINAL

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

I mean there are some indications that in some places, yes, there is lower economic
activity, which will translate to lower losses or claims, really haven't reflected that yet. I
mean we want to take a cautious approach on that. So I'd like to think that maybe there
are some to come down the road, but for now we haven't factored that anywhere in our
numbers.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great. And then second question, just curious, Marc. As you look at I guess the Heals Act
here, there is a component into it of kind of a liability call an indemnification as you think
about it, if that doesn't go through, is that a potential issue here for you in the insurance
industry and how do you kind of think about it from an underwriting perspective, you're
going forward.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

I missed the word you said, Brian, could you repeat the early part of the question.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Well, it's basically got curious about protection or what you think about as far as the
economy reopening here and potential liability associated with kind of COVID- 19, the
current, I think it's called the Heals Act or the CARE 2 Act, it's got some language in there
trying to grant businesses in the community for it, right. Just curious of your thoughts
around that -- for insurance.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Well, it's not -- it's just going to allocate more liability to us or presumption to us is not
good, but I think listen, these laws are always, there is always things that are happening.
We're going to have to react to what we see when we see it. That's all I can tell you, Brian,
it's very hard to to sit here and go through what impact it is, if we were to react and then
go to full drill about everything that goes in, a bill that's proposed, it would take a lot of
our time, so we'll react to that when we react to it. Right.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

And Marc, I think you got it wrong. I think mistake my question, my question more is from
your insurance policies perspective, as you look going forward -- as the economy reopens
up, there's clearly EPLI exposures, GL exposures, all sorts of exposures to potentially
present themselves of benefit, how do you -- how are you thinking about that from an
underwriting perspective?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Well, we have written policies that have EPLI exposure, we have GL exposures, but we are
not a large risk writer. We don't write the large insured, so we would have certainly
Page 18 of 25



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td

FINAL

something that would be helpful to us, we would -- we would argue that a lot of the larger
claims, a lot of -- a lot of the focus from the lawyers plaintiff bar would be focused on the
larger deeper pocket insurance. That's one thing we have for us. We also have a fairly
amount -- good healthy amount of reinsurance, so we're not overly concerned with the
sideways haven't changed. Yeah.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you. Okay. And then another just quick one here, your travel insurance, I'm just curious
how big of a book is that and obviously we're probably going to see some continued
pressures there for the rest of the year.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yeah. It was originally about a couple of hundred million dollars of premium and now it's
down, I mean, you can see the numbers, you can multiply by four, I don't need to -- 250
actually, for the year. So that's -- it's been -- it's taken a big dent and that also explains
why the growth was more tested this quarter than otherwise could have been.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great. And then one other just quick one here for you, I know you guys launched a sidecar,
I guess this is in the first quarter, any thoughts about additional kind of alternative capacity
here to potentially capture some of the good attractive opportunities in reinsurance.

about, you know, we certainly are always on the look out to raise capital to deploy with
third party, a lot of discussions are happening all over, we'll have probably more update as
we -- as we see it happen and we'll be communicating to you to the extent as
appropriate, but I must clearly.

for the shareholders, there's a lot going on, we are still going through the process of
approval process and we're keeping a keen eye on what's happening, I think they

Q - Phil Stef ano

{BIO 18965951 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks. Just a quick one on the Bellemeade transaction, I'm thinking about the
potential for these moving forward, I guess it feels like the Bellemeade deal that was
done in the past quarter, just given as attachment was probably more for S&P Capital
credit than PMIERs. When we saw in MI, pure play come out with their own transaction,
which is in my mind, more of a traditional attachment point in the low single digits, so the
spreads on that and the placing was significantly higher. How are you thinking about that
the managing of tail risk that Bellemeade provides versus just the capital credit that could
be from playing, I would think, something that could be considered well above the
working layers for the MI reinsurance coverage and the capital relief is something like that
might provide.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yeah. It's good question, I think it's always something we evaluate when and if we place or
look at options that are in front of us. You are correct, this one attaches -- the last one
attaches above the PMIERs credit, but we're still very much -- we have a healthy PMIERs
ratio, so that didn't really concern us too much at this point, not to say that next time or
down the road, we may not go back to a lower attachment point. But yeah, the focus was
really, yes, it's an available source of capital from a rating agency point of view, S&P you're
correct and it covers that, it provides us coverage there and also we felt is being the first
one out of the gate, even before the GSEs, to go back and access the capital markets
was we thought a very strong message demonstrated again, I touched on it, the quality to
book and the investor base is still very -- has a lot of interest and appetite for the product.
So I think we were happy with the placement, no question it's always too expensive. We'd
like to see the price to come down. We hope they do down the road, but for the time
being, given the economics in front of us, we were -- I think it was a good move on our
part.

FINAL

Did we do this, I think it's about $50 million.

Q - Geoffrey Dunn

{BIO 3447798 <GO>}

Okay. And then what think forward past the end of new forbearance,so early next year. So
given what you know about the economy now, obviously very different from a couple of
months ago, how would you think about claim rates on new notices without forbearance,
again you pointed out, it's very different with home prices, remains to be seen if we are
going into a recession or not, and I think Marc, last quarter you suggested, we might be
looking at 13, 14 given what you knew then. So what do you think about that type of
number, as you get into early 2021, based on what you know today.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

I think the 5% is probably. This is like on NOD, so you're talking about claims rate for the
portfolio.

Q - Geoffrey Dunn

{BIO 3447798 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

On NODs, so new notices coming in and forbearance goes away.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yeah. Right. I think we were at 7.9 pre-COVID. I think that the forbearance should be,
should be pretty, pretty helpful and to bring it up not bring up to the 13-14, you just
mentioned that I mentioned the first quarter, that's probably my gut would tell me, a slight
increase for a while until we see things shake out and things getting back to more
normalcy and I think now reverting back to some kind of level, I think the forbearance
program were to play out, to which we play out, it is still very uncertain, as you know
Geoff. I think that we should get back to, it might be elevated for a while, maybe 12%, 13%
for a while, but it should go back down at some point for next year I would say.

Q - Geoffrey Dunn

{BIO 3447798 <GO>}

Okay. All right. So you do think given what you know about the economy and built up
equity that you could still see 12% type of incidents assumption.

A - Marc Grandisson

Yeah. On NODs right, on new NODs for regular BQ, not for the forbearance piece, the
forbearance piece we gave, we did give a discount right, discounted that. So yes.

Hi. I just had a question on pricing and just how you think about the interplay between the
decline and exposure that the economy remains weak and how that could affect demand
and pricing and relatedly, what else is out there that you think could potentially derail the
momentum that you've seen in pricing of both in insurance and reinsurance.

I mean it's hard to predict the future, as you know, oh my god, I think, if everything
resolved, if everything resolved -- I mean even if things resolved for the better, I think the
momentum that we've seen in the first quarter, late 2019 and early 2020, I think we will
still see some momentum. I think it would be just a matter of degree how much -- how
much higher the rates could go, but I do believe the momentum was there for turn of a
market will be for pre-COVID-19. COVID-19, like I said before exacerbated the need for
rate and accelerate the need for rate.

And then there has been a lot of talk about sort of ILS and trapped capacity and what do
you think about when either some of the capacity gets relieved or potentially gets
absorbed and once there is clarity on that, do you think by this time next year, like a lot of
the capital would actually be out.

It's a possibility. I mean that's also assuming there is no more cat occurring this year, but
this is a long-lasting cat event. So it's not as clear as having a quake, let's say in March and
get in a year out, it's still developing, but you have a better sense for wanting to or would
be willing to release capital.
This one will take a bit longer to process through, right. For instance, you could have
arguments in courts and new ways and you push back on the insurance industry to pay
claims and that would take -- that could take you know another year-and-a-half to two
years to resolve. So there's a lot more uncertainty in terms of timing, finding resolution of
the ultimate prices. So it's a lot less certain that it will take only a year to get through it.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Hi. Good afternoon. I wanted to follow up on the conversation we've been having about
forbearance programs and to what extent delinquencies get cured to claims, turning to
claim sort of et cetera. And I appreciate that. We don't know what's going to happen
going forward, but I wonder if you could speak to what you learned in previous
forbearance programs and how that -- how that affects your thinking about your current
book and what you learned in there, was it -- did you learn anything about LTVs,
geographies, sort of et cetera and how does that apply to your existing book today.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

I think we have done reserving in the past, considering all the dimensions, you just talked
about, I think that we had the -- the beautiful thing about the prior Hurricanes or the
beautiful thing in a way is that we had prior Hurricanes and prior events that we can go
back to and look at the experience. That definitely helps us, but I guess boundaries
around what could happen, but this one is very unusual in the length of the forbearance
program and the breadth and how widely spread it is and I think we also have to throw in
there the $600 per week unemployment benefits and the distribution that we talked
about, some regions are more heavily affected than others.
So I think everything gets in the mix Jaime. It's not just one dimension, and I think what
we've learned is that we sort of can you use the historical forbearance experience as sort
of a -- as the range of possible outcomes, but we actually are digging heavily, heavily into
developing a much more refined view of the forbearance specific programs such as the
one we are facing right now and we may never use it again, but at least, we are in the

process of readjusting our development claims, model called Armor that we have
internally.
So we are still very much developing and we're learning on the fly.

Two things I'll add quickly to that. As Marc mentioned, historically forbearance
delinquencies, most of them cure, I mean and we made comment that the 2% kind of
claim rate. So that's -- that's obviously a very positive sign, but that's again more localized
and it's a short-term issue. So I mean understandable that these delinquencies, most of
them would cure. So that would be -- one extreme that would be a very good result in this
situation, maybe a little of a counter to that, as you may know, many of the claims and for
the mortgages are loans in forbearance, up to 40% were actually still current, up until
recently. So the early days of the second quarter, many loans had access to forbearance
programs, but remain current and made their mortgage payments, the data now suggest
that that percentage has come down, so the reality is now we'll get a few more loans that
have turned delinquent that were historically current or have been current and
forbearance, but now turn delinquent.

Bloomberg Transcript

So that's a bit of a data point that we're monitoring, but that kind of gives us a bit of, not
necessarily concerned, but we have to understand better, so that we can refine our
estimates as we move forward, because the 2% ultimate claim rate may not be
achievable or probably won't be what we end up with in this current situation.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Okay. All right, great. I appreciate it. Good luck on the future.
