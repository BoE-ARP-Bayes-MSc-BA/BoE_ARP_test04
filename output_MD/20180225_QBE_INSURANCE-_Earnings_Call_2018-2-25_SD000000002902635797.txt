Presentation

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. Welcome to our 2017 full year results presentation. Before I
start, probably I should welcome a couple of people to the audience. We have David
McMilan, in the front row here, who is our new Group Chief Operating Officer; and
obviously, Michael, who is our new Group Chief Financial Officer.
In addition to talking you through the 2017 results we are also going to talk you through a
little bit of our strategic agenda. We spent the last few months conducting a detailed
review of the business and preparing our program for change. And I will give you a few of
the outline of that program in a minute. Before I do that, let me cover -- a little bit of color
on 2017. The group recorded a combined ratio for 2017 of 104.1%. And as you know our
results, as well as those of the broader global insurance industry, was significantly
impacted by unprecedented levels of global catastrophe events, with a total global
catastrophe activity now estimated to be around $135 billion; Hurricanes Harvey, Irma,
Maria, Mexican earthquakes, California wildfires. And closer to home Cyclone Debbie and
the December Australian storms.

FINAL

And all of that meant our overall cat claims increased and added 6 points to the group's
combined ratio with North America and Equator particularly impacted. Excluding that
excess cat cost our combined ratio for 2017 would have been around 98%. After the
reserve strengthening we booked at year end we saw reduced level of positive prior year
developments at about $40 million for the year.
And touching quickly on some of the divisionals, which Michael will go into in a bit more
detail in a moment, North America had a combined ratio of 109%, with the results
obviously heavily impacted by the weather events, which added 7% above our normal
divisional cat allowances. And we also strengthened reserves across a few specific
portfolios. Absent the 2 items North America's combined ratio was approximately 98%.
Europe delivered a strong result with a combined ratio of 95% despite what's been
challenging market conditions in the region for probably about the last five years and
increased cat activity last year. In fact, Europe's combined ratio at 95%, I think will in all
likelihood be much lower than most of its London market competitors.

Bloomberg Transcript

And so the remediation plans, sell review processes. And the focus on quality
underwriting pricing and claims that we first implemented in the second half of 2016 and
then throughout 2017 have further improved ancillaries' performance. The division
recorded a combined ratio of 92% with an attritional loss ratio excluding LMI now having
improved by roughly 5% from the first half of 2016. We also strengthened the group PoA
by 0.5 point to 90%.
We delivered a good investment return of 3.2% benefiting from both good tactical asset
allocation and favorable market conditions. And despite the cat events, our capital
position remains strong. Our PCI multiple of 1.64 and that's before the benefits of the
LatAm sale and S&P Capital close to AA level.
I did want to talk specifically about performance in Asia Pacific that I think can be best
described as unacceptable. We saw significant losses on our Hong Kong worker's comp
portfolio particularly the construction book, we also strengthened reserves in the Hong
Kong worker's comp portfolio. The attritional claims ratio was adversely impacted by
increased frequency across a number of portfolios including property in Hong Kong,
Singapore and marine in Hong Kong, Singapore. And Indonesia. We also saw an increase
in expenses, although in part due to the restructuring costs we took in the Fourth Quarter
to take out a layer of regional costs.
That said, our businesses in Asia are long-established businesses and I believe we do
have a realistic plan to improve performance there and I'll come back to that in a moment.
On Latin America, as you will have seen from our announcement this morning, we have
made the decision to exit Latin America excluding Puerto Rico, which will now become
part of North America. And while we have a number -- we are having a solid business in
Argentina, we are subscale in a number of the other markets in Latin America. And we've
made the decision that essentially we do not have a realistic plan to achieve an
acceptable return in those markets.

FINAL

The sale of LatAm to Zurich for $409 million is equivalent to approximately 1.4x the book
value or 2x tangible book value excluding (DTAs). And I think the deal represents very
good chip values for our shareholders. And this is consistent with us focus on simplifying
the group, reducing risk. And improving the consistency of our results.
Just on that, let me switch focus slightly and talk through our strategic agenda and
priorities for 2018. So commented earlier, over the last few months we've been
conducting a detailed review of the business. And let me start by saying QBE has many
strengths from which to build off. We clearly have some businesses with strong market
positions that are performing well or indeed very well. We also have a number of areas,
where we can and need to improve.
On the back of the review, we have created a program that will drive performance, with 7
key elements to it. Simplifying QBE by market and my product, a focus on the Brilliant
Basics of underwriting pricing and claims, driving a performance improvement through our
sell review process, further repositioning North America, building on the work that's
already been done; remediating Asia and significantly improving performance there,
building talent and creating a distinctive QBE culture. And building a QBE for the future
and modernizing QBE.

Bloomberg Transcript

I will give you a little bit of a flavor of each of those elements now. And while we do have
many high performing businesses at QBE we do need to further simplify our business,
reduce risk and reduce volatility. And we'll do this by ensuring we only operate in markets
and products where we have a good market position and a realistic plan that can deliver
an acceptable return.
Let me be clear, the vast majority of our portfolios will meet this threshold test; this is not
about a wholesale reduction in the size of QBE beyond exiting Latin America. And Latin
America is a major step forward to simplifying QBE. And our focus now will be more on
certain products and portfolios than it will be on exiting countries.
To give you a few examples, we've stopped writing construction workers comp business
in Hong Kong, we've significantly refocused and reduced the marine business in
Indonesia, exiting there, for example, the tugs and barges segment. And as we
mentioned earlier, in December we announced, we entered into agreement for the sale
of QBE Thailand. And with 2 Brilliant Basics, it is fair to say we will be forensically focusing
on what I call Brilliant Basics. It is imperative that the basics of insurance of underwriting
pricing and claims are performed not just at consistently high standards but brilliantly.
Don't get me wrong, we have got some real areas of expertise to build off here, to
ensure all of this happens I have established a new Brilliant Basics program of work aimed
at delivering a consistent excellence in underwriting pricing and claims everywhere that
we do business. I'll give you a few examples as -- certainly not -- nothing like the whole
program. But a few examples of the work we're doing. On underwriting, for example,
we've developed a set of global underwriting standards that are being implemented
across the whole of QBE, this could, for example, refine how underwriting authorities are

Page 3 of 21



Company N ame: QBE I nsurance Group L td
Company Ticker: QBE AU Equity
Date: 2018-02-25

earned, how pay orders are conducted. How product committees work in countries,
product guidelines and the delegated authority frameworks.

FINAL

We are of course hiring the new group chief underwriting officer, who amongst other
things, will ensure the full implementation of underwriting Brilliant Basics. In the meantime,
Richard Pryce, our European CEO, has been leading this initial implementation and doing
fantastic work for me driving this program forward.
For pricing Brilliant Basics we've developed a customized pricing tool, a customized
pricing assessment tool that we call Pat that we're using to rank and assess all of our
pricing models across the world. And we are working through a systematic program to
deploy the best available pricing models. Now sometimes this will be about using new
data, sometimes it will be about updating the models more frequently, sometimes using
a greater amount of data analytics or indeed introducing machine learning into the pricing
tools. And sometimes this will involve using a globally consistent pricing tool for something
like commercial property.

Bloomberg Transcript

On claims, we've previously mentioned we already have a global transformation program
that made significant claim savings to date. And we do believe that further saving is
achievable in 2018. Claims Brilliant Basics will incorporate this program and expand it and
we will be implementing claims global standards and this will involve enhancing the use of
supply chain techniques, embedding data analytics deeply in our claims processes,
redesigning some of the critical core claims handling processes and better claims MI.
I have spoken to all of you about the sell review process we established in ANZO some 18
months or so ago, that I think has been one of the key tools of our improvement there.
And it's fair to say it's a much more mature process today than when we started it. It is a
pretty intense and forensic process. We brought the Australian business down into
roughly 50 sub-business units or sells as we call them and regularly reviewed in great
detail the underwriting improvement plans specifically charging the underwriting pricing
and claims actions to drive improvement. And this is done by the head of claims, the head
of pricing and the head of actuarial in the room to verify those actions by step.
This might include new hazard code approaches, price changes by customer segment or
specific claims actions. These are then quantified and rigorously tracked by sale and this
creates a very thorough operating rhythm that will combine fact-based discussions with
obviously a focus on tracking our Brilliant Basic initiatives. But ultimately it's about driving a
higher degree of accountability around our underwriting performance. But it's also about
showcasing where we've got some real areas of expertise.
One of the key elements of our group strategy is ensuring North America performs at a
similar level to Europe and ANZO and as such we have designed a piece of work aimed at
further repositioning our North American business. (inaudible) this our first and foremost
obviously delivering the 2018 plan and fully implementing that sell review process.
Secondly, deeply embedding Brilliant Basic fundamentals across the division and all
product lines. Third, further simplifying the operating model there, simplifying our IT

Page 4 of 21

FINAL

platforms there and taking out cost. And as we've done all of that, further refining the
portfolio.
As you can see from the chart, we've significantly changed the North American portfolio
over the last four years. We shrunk our program business down to a more profitable core,
we completely exited Mortgage & Lender Services and we're growing our specialty
business. In the next phase, we will grow and build on that by defining specific industry
verticals and underwriting capabilities that allow us to selectively grow in corporate and
specialty portfolios.
On the other side, we will also be reviewing our position in personal lines, which probably
means exiting some of the smaller parts there, for example, the independent agents
business, where we don't have scale or competitive advantage.

Bloomberg Transcript

On Asia, I have previously mentioned, we need a lot of work to do to improve our results
in Asia and again this falls into 3 pretty obvious categories; putting in place a
comprehensive program of performance improvement plans, rebuilding Brilliant Basics
across the region. And reducing cost. We've identified 18 portfolios that need -- those
significantly underperforming and need specific profit improvement plans. And you can
see the total of those up there on the chart. For example, Hong Kong workers comp,
Hong Kong marine, Singapore marine, accident. And health. And you can see the
premium we are writing there has already started to reduce in the second half of 2017.
Specific actions were taken include obviously rate increases, a reduction in the high hazard
indexes and again you can see that's starting to get some traction and significantly
reducing certain sub-segments of business. In addition, underwriting appetites and
authorities have been reset and sometimes completely centralized. The program is
somewhat similar to the program we implement in Australia. But probably different and a
little more complex and it will take some time to fully fix Asia, although I do think we'll
make significant progress in 2018.
I think I'm confident that the areas we've just spoken about are the right plan and focus
for QBE for the near term. But I'm equally passionate about building a QBE to thrive in the
future. To be successful in the future as well as having underwriting discipline, we also
need to be innovative, more customer-focused, invest in our talent, have a distinctive
culture and have a clear technology roadmap embracing digital.
So most of our time will go on areas 1 to 5 I've just outlined, we will also be accelerating
some work in these areas as well. On culture, we will roll out a new target culture, built
around our 7 cultural dimensions of accountability, being technically excellent, being fastpaced, being decisive and courageous, putting team first, being customer oriented and
being diverse and inclusive. This made a big difference to us in the ANZO business and
I'm hoping will make a similarly big difference to us across the whole group.
On innovation, we made 2 very successful investments in the short term partners last year
and we will be looking to make more of those this year. On customer focus, we need to
increase our customer centricity overall but specifically in our claims process. And on

operational efficiency, I do think there is significant scope for automation there. And David,
obviously, one of his primary tasks, as our new COO, is to look at where we have specific
efficiency opportunities. And we'll come back to you on that in due course. More on all of
these areas as we go through 2018.

FINAL

With that, I will now hand over to Michael to take you through a little more of the financial
data.

Michael J. T. Ford

{BIO 17494941 <GO>}

Thanks, Pat. Good morning, everyone. I'm delighted to be here today to deliver the QBE
year-end results. I'd like to start by taking you through a few key items that relate to the
group's results. It's important to note that the results reflected in this slide, with the
exception of the last 3 items, have been adjusted to exclude the material items that
distort the group's performance. And these adjustments are as outlined in our 23rd of
January market announcement. And as Pat highlighted, the final result is broadly in line
with that announcement.

Bloomberg Transcript

And just to remind you, as we discussed in January, we booked a $700 million non-cash
impairment charge relating to the North American goodwill. Secondly, the results were
impacted by a $230 million write-down of deferred tax assets in North America and that's
following the recent change in tax rates there. The results have been adjusted for Ogden
in the U.K. And finally the last portfolio transfer that we've just completed at the end of
the year to reinsure the U.S. commercial auto liabilities and that has only had a very small
impact on the overall ratios.
Now moving through the adjusted results, the group achieved 0.5 growth in GWP and 7%
NEP growth on a constant currency basis. And it was pleasing to see we achieved over 2%
in overall premium rate momentum for the yearend, largely due to the average rate
increases in ANZO of around 5%, as well as improvements in pricing conditions in North
America and Europe. And that's despite the market environments remaining highly
competitive.
As Pat outlined earlier, the group recorded a combined operating ratio of 104.1%
excluding the impact from the change in risk-free rates and there were 2 key factors that
contributed to the deterioration. The significant cat activity and weather-related items in
2017 have resulted in a net cost of large risk and cat claims of $1.3 billion or around 14.6%
of NEP. This added approximately 6% to the group's combined operating ratio.
We strengthened reserves around $110 million in the second half of 2017 largely in our
long tail casualty lines, in our Assumed Re business in North America. And in Asia Pacific,
we increased reserves in our Hong Kong workers compensation portfolio. Prior accident
year claims development was favorable for the full year amounting to $37 million and
inclusive of that second half reserve strengthening.
So turning to a couple of the other items, the statutory net loss for the year was $1.2
billion, the group's tax rate was distorted by the tax losses in North America, coupled with
Page 6 of 21



Company N ame: QBE I nsurance Group L td
Company Ticker: QBE AU Equity
Date: 2018-02-25

losses in Equator Re impacted by the significant cat losses.

FINAL

We will pay a final dividend of AUD 0.04 per share resulting in a full year dividend of AUD
0.26, down from the AUD 0.54 paid in 2016.
Turning now to the divisional results. And this slide shows the overall divisional results
comprising our combined operating ratio of 104.1%. As Pat has already run through Asia
Pacific and Latin America, I will provide an update on North America, Equator Re, Europe
and Australia and New Zealand.
So as you can see in the waterfall, North America's combined operating ratio of 109% was
impacted by 2 key components, the record catastrophe activity and severe weather
events added around 7% above the normal allowances to the ratio.

Bloomberg Transcript

We also specifically strengthened reserves in North America, mainly in casualty and
Assumed Re, management liability, accident and health and the now terminated specialty
program. Excluding these items, North America's adjusted combined operating ratio was
around 98%.
Furthermore, during 2017, we completed a further loss portfolio transfer of discontinued
programs to mitigate the risk of substantial adverse claims development. Together with
the LPT undertaken in 2016, we've removed in excess of $850 million of potentially
volatile claims liabilities from our balance sheet. The LPTs coupled with a further $114
million of reserve strengthening provide us with a strong foundation for improved
profitability and reduced earnings volatility as we head into 2018.
Equator Re. And as you know this bridges the gap between the group's risk appetite and
local risk appetites. As you would expect, as our internal reinsurance vehicle the severity
of catastrophe activities heavily impacted Equator Re's results, with the division recording
a combined operating ratio of 141%. Excluding this impact, the combined operating ratio
would have been 89%.
Now in Europe, despite challenging market conditions for the last five years or so in the
region, coupled with the catastrophe activity and a reduced level of prior year
development EO delivered a strong result for 2017, recording a combined operating ratio
of 95%. It's important to highlight that we do have North American property cat exposure
through both the direct insurance business in Europe within the international property
segment, as well as through our reinsurance business.
EO's prior accident year claims development was favorable by $141 million which
benefited the combined operating ratio by around 4% although this was a lower level
than in 2016. The division remains focused on strict pricing disciplines and improving our
claims management activities through enhanced data and analytics practices.
Australia and New Zealand continued to show solid progress in 2017 delivering a
combined operating ratio of 92%. Our pricing initiatives have delivered average premium
Page 7 of 21

Date: 2018-02-25

FINAL

rate increases of 6% excluding CTP and coupled with enhanced underwriting discipline,
tightened terms and conditions. And claims management practices have improved
ANZO's attritional ratio excluding LMI by around 3% when compared with the prior year.
This is, of course, on top of the improvement in the second half of 2016, which means the
ANZO attritional has improved by 5% since the first half of 2016.
We've been pleased to see improvement across New South Wales CTP, trade credit,
personal motor, commercial motor and in most of our short tail personal and commercial
lines. We continue to be well reserved in ANZO and our FY'17 reserve release of 4.5% of
NEP were broadly in line with what we achieved in 2016.
We believe we've got further room for improvement in 2018 in ANZO and we remain well
reserved in ANZO and our FY'17 reserve releases of 4.5% of NEP were broadly in line with
what we achieved in 2016. We believe we've got further room for improvement in 2018 in
ANZO and we remain very focused on further targeted improvement in our loss ratios
across the division as market pricing remains generally supportive.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning now to Investment Performance, our investment portfolio delivered a net return
of 3.2% for the year with both our fixed income book and growth assets delivering strong
gains and exceeding our expectations and target range of 2.5% to 3%. Throughout the
year mark to market capital gains from tightening of credit spreads enhanced our fixed
income returns and coupled with proactive management of duration resulted in a 2.1%
return from fixed income.
Our fixed income portfolio duration of 1.6 years is broadly in line with the prior year and
we anticipate bond yields to rise in 2018 and therefore we will most likely manage
duration of our fixed income portfolio between 1.5 and two years throughout the year.
Our returns have been boosted not just by solid underlying asset class returns but also by
tactical positioning in growth assets duration and spread duration which has seen us more
meaningfully exposed ahead of periods of outperformance.
Turning to our growth assets exposure peaked at 13.2% of total investment assets in April,
however after an especially strong performance has been reduced to end the year at
around 10.2%. And pleasingly we achieved a return of 13.3% in the growth asset portfolio
for 2017.
Moving on to financial strength and capital management and the group's capital position
remains strong, when measured against both regulatory and rating agency capital
requirements, despite the severe catastrophe claims activity experienced throughout the
year. The catastrophes dividends paid and the share buyback activity in the second half of
the year has resulted in our APRA PCA multiple falling slightly to 1.6x at year-end and
that's down from 1.69x at 30, June 2017.
Following our 23 January market release, S&P revised the group's outlook from positive to
stable although pleasingly our S&P Capital remains very close to the AA level as indicated
in the speedometer graph on this chart. We've already commenced work to strengthen
the group's PCA multiple closer to the middle of our benchmark PCA range of 1.6 to 1.8x
Page 8 of 21



Company N ame: QBE I nsurance Group L td
Company Ticker: QBE AU Equity
Date: 2018-02-25

and return our gearing closer to our benchmark to equity range of 25% to 35%. And that
will be via a combination of earnings growth and other capital management initiatives and
indeed the sale of our Latin American operations is part of this.

FINAL

We started the year with a very strong balance sheet and despite the after-tax net cash
loss we are pleased to have finished the year with a balance sheet that remains strong.
Our other key metric here is our free cash flow or dividend remittances from the
businesses to the group. This obviously provides cash cover for our external dividend. In
2017, cash remittances remain strong and we're only slightly down from the prior period.
As I said earlier, the board has declared a final dividend of AUD 0.04 per share, 30%
franked. And the lower dividend payout reflects the impact of the catastrophe claims in
the second half of 2017. Following the introduction of our 3-year share buyback facility
announced last August, we were active in the market in the second half of the year
purchasing a total of $139 million in shares and resulting in the cancellation of 12.9 million
shares. We remain committed to our 3-year buyback program and intend to take a
considered approach in executing the buyback during this year.

Bloomberg Transcript

I'm excited to be part of QBE, we have some very clear operational and financial
objectives to deliver over the coming months through in line with the group's focus a
stronger and simpler QBE, as Pat outlined earlier. I look forward to meeting with many of
you in the upcoming weeks and I'll now hand back to Pat for his closing comments.

Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Thanks, Michael. Look, as I hope you can tell, the program of work we put together
doesn't rely on the external environment for help. But it is positive to note for the first
time in a long while we are seeing a more positive rate environment across our major
markets.
In the Fourth Quarter of last year rate increases averaged 3% to 4% across the group and
we've seen the continuation, in fact, slight improvement of that trend in the First Quarter
and actually ANZO excludes the impact of CTP reforms running at about 6%, albeit across
the group there are great variations between markets, product lines. And loss affected
areas as you would expect.
Against this, we probably need to be slightly cautious at least the possibility of higher
levels of inflation going forward. It's also worth noting that post the U.S. tax changes the
group will have a lower effective tax rate going forward. And the major return that's
probably closer to 20%. And probably slightly lower than that in 2018.
The announcement of the sale of LatAm is a good step in our program of simplifying the
group and also add some capital. We've come through 2017 with a strong capital position
that allows the board to reaffirm our dividend payout policy of up to 65% and leaves us
well positioned to continue our share buyback program.

Our results do show in 2017 that we have a lot of work to do. That said we've mobilized a
program of work aimed at simplifying the group and driving real performance
improvement in 2018 and beyond.

FINAL

My team and I are very confident this is the right program of work for QBE and are very
energized about delivering it. And we look forward to updating you all on progress as we
go forward. With that, we will hand it over to Q&A.

Questions And Answers
Q - Andrew Buncombe

{BIO 19921333 <GO>}

Andrew Buncombe, Macquarie Securities. Two quick questions, if I can. The first 1, really
from me the obvious 1 in terms of the gearing, 40.9% to start with. Take off the LatAm
sale that show about a 39% even still way above your target range of 25% to 35%. It
implies about another $850 odd million of sales or material organic growth. I appreciate
the comment that there would be organic growth and further capital management. But
how should we be thinking about this? How quickly should be -- we be thinking about you
moving back inside the range?

A - Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Look, we've got plans that allow us to move back to -- to our range. Obviously, as you
remember 25% to 35% relatively quickly. Even before the LatAm sale of $400 million,
we've got $1 billion of cash at the center. So it gives us quite a bit of financial flexibility,
obviously, together with earnings.

Q - Andrew Buncombe

{BIO 19921333 <GO>}

And second question is on the Australian LMI business. The regulator seems like they are
being more favorable in the outlook of growing that market. Your biggest competitor in
the market is positioning themselves for growth over the last couple of years you have
been happy to track the revenue side wise, how should we be thinking about that division
given it's so capital intensive?

A - Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Look it was an interesting development wasn't it so, I think at the very least there have
been the question in everybody's mind about what the future of the LMI sector looks like
long term. Would the banks continue to use it, it certainly could have more compelling
now that it looks like there's going to be capital credit going forward. We actually -- our
top line in LMI for the first time in a while was up very slightly in 2017 versus 2016, I don't
think we're looking for big growth in LMI going forward to your point returns of normalized
somewhat you may have seen, you may not get a chance to see yet. Our combined ratio
was 50% for LMI in 2017. There was a couple of factors in there we had a more normal
commission ratio, we also tucked bit a of risk margin away in LMI. But I think kind of sort of
the overall level of volume that we've got now is comfortable and I think the
developments that we all read about in terms of capital are probably supportive of that.

Q - Daniel P. Toohey

{BIO 16751863 <GO>}

Daniel Toohey, Morgan Stanley. Firstly, just touching on the higher retention on cats and
maybe if you confirm whether that was part of your original guidance? So the retention
that was going from $1.15 billion to $1.2 billion?

FINAL

A - Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Yes. So the original -- the guidance we put in place yes does include the 1.2 attachment
point for the (GLSC).

Q - Daniel P. Toohey

{BIO 16751863 <GO>}

Then just maybe stating the obvious. But the LatAm sale obviously excluded all sorts of
guidance?

A - Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. It may be stating the obvious but it's a good question to ask. So as you can tell by the
fact that we announced the LatAm sale this morning that has been finalized over the
weekend. We put our target ranges obviously for the first time about a month ago. So
they did not contemplate at the time the sale of Latin America. And I said that kind of
went through and we signed that over the weekend. I think, in terms of our combined
ratio it doesn't make a huge difference, we will end up owning LatAm for most of this year
as it goes through to approval -- completion. But yes, formally, the target envisages owing
LatAm.

Q - Daniel P. Toohey

{BIO 16751863 <GO>}

Okay, just moving to Europe. I noted you changed the Ogden rate from minus 0.75 to 2.5
positive. So 0.25 positive. Can you just in line -- I mean if you back out the reserve
releases context, a new (profitability) the combine is running close to 100? Is there any
concern there with continuing reserve strengthening? You've talked about financialized
deterioration.

A - Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Daniel P. Toohey

{BIO 16751863 <GO>}

The one-off or maybe quantifying perhaps the one-off U.S. long tail liabilities
strengthening within that as well?

A - Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Look I think, I mean it's a fair question, I think that if you've seen, I'm sure you've all
followed some of the trends in the London market more broadly. And that market has
seen a number of years of price decline. So that's going to slowly (eaten) kind of current
year -- current accident year margin. So I think our business has done well probably by
comparison to a few others that we had lots of companies in that market posting results
well north of 100%. So our combined was 95. But I think Michael mentioned we had about

4 points of prior year. So yes you're right. I think, a couple of things outside, one is you're
right, we did have some financial lines impact, I won't quantify that more than we can we
talked about today. I think that the other thing I'd point to as well as our ongoing
underwriting discipline there. For the first time in a long while we are seeing a more
positive pricing environment, that the absence of a headwind is not a storming hard
market. But what we are seeing kind of modest single-digit price increases there, which is
helpful.

Q - Daniel P. Toohey

{BIO 16751863 <GO>}

Okay. And just finally, there's no top line targetsâ€¦

A - Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

No.

Q - Daniel P. Toohey

{BIO 16751863 <GO>}

-- consistent with you, you've previously. But another Brilliant Basics model, can you give us
some idea of what ROE your target in your sales and where you want to get the ROE to?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Yes, great question. So we haven't today, as we talked before, given top line targets, I
don't think that's kind of probably in our interests. Although, when we went through the
similar program in ANZO we haven't really ended up reducing top line kind of at all, albeit
we've been helped by obviously a kind of what's ended up as a good pricing environment
there. I think as we've done that, we've -- there's a couple of things we've targeted in this
overview process. This might sound a bit obvious and is a bit obvious, making sure every
single sale can deliver a performance of a combined ratio less than 100. And it's amazing
what you can achieve just by getting them all to do that. In terms of ROEs, I think we
haven't given medium-term targets on ROEs today. I think as we do look to the medium
term, it is a realistic target for us to try and achieve a double-digit ROE that's what we
should do across the group and obviously that's a name within our sole review process as
well.

FINAL

Pretty -- against strong rate rise, I must say.

A - Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

I think, what we saw in the ANZO results was retention was very good. So the focus for
the team has been really -- so retention was kind of around 82%. So keeping hold of the
high-quality business we've got and that's a business that's got lots of high-quality
business. So first and foremost, we were more selective on new business. So if you do
the math of an average 6% ex-CTP rate increase, if there was a reduction it was in the
matter of new business we're writing, which is what we intended to do.

Q - Nigel Pittaway

{BIO 3406058 <GO>}

Okay so you've -- but are you through that you think, I mean are youâ€¦

I think, are there, is every -- you should ask in fact, is this is every portfolio exactly as he
wants it, no. I would have said that the same are we through the major heavy-duty lifting
of that, yes.

Q - Nigel Pittaway

{BIO 3406058 <GO>}

Okay then turning to North America, I mean presumably these first 2 things you've got on
Slide 7, you've already done, right. So the commercial auto is exited. Have you narrowed
the program focus as much as you intend or is there more of that to go? Then the
personal lines is still to do, is that -- is that right?

A - Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Mostly, yes. So commercial auto is done, there's a little bit more to go on programs,
although the big dollars of that have been done. And personal lines we will need to do a
little bit more focusing. The biggest bulk of premium within the personal lines numbers is
construed the westward agency business the one I've talked to you about before that's
very good. Got a nice distribution model there that gives us some competitive advantage.
The business we write through the independent agents, which is a bit smaller, less clear
that we've got competitive advantages.

Q - Nigel Pittaway

{BIO 3406058 <GO>}

Then the sort of industry focus that you're sort of saying the industry verticals and refining
your underwriting appetite in middle market, I mean how different is that to what you
currently do?

It's not meant to sound completely different. What is really signaling I think is as we grow
that business out, we've got to be smart at how we do it. We can't compete broadly
across all industries and all geographies in the U.S. against the mid-market competition.
That wouldn't be smart, we've got to pick our spots for how we do that. We've done that
successfully in specialty. We will look to do that, if you like, replicate that model across the
commercial business as well. So it'll be picking both certain geographies to do that in
certain industries to do that in as well. It's not completely different to what we've done.
But it's just some we need to be smart as we kind of very selectively grow, going forward.

Q - James Coghill

{BIO 14006200 <GO>}

James Coghill, UBS. Pat, couple of questions. One on capital and one P&L question.
Capital one, just following on from the earlier question, I was just hoping that you could be
a little bit more specific about what you are saying there because the text is a constrained
approach to buybacks in first half '18, Michael seemed to indicate that buybacks were off
the cards in '18.

A - Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - James Coghill

{BIO 14006200 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And understandably you haven't crystallized that $1 billion number again anywhere in
today. So Pat if you could just put a bit of structure around what the real capital return
plans are, that these aren't just ongoing hollow promises?

A - Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Let me a bit more specific then James. So the program was $1 billion over three years. So
even I can do the math, it is 330-ish a year, that our intention is to do that run rate this
year. I think we only use the word considered because sometimes if we're not in the
market every single day, people are calling us up saying why are you not in the market
today. So it'll just be considered as and when we do that. But that type of run rate is what
we're expecting to do in 2018.

Q - James Coghill

{BIO 14006200 <GO>}

Okay. And the second question was on Asia. So I mean it looks like the run rate will reduce
further, this is on premium into financial '18. So when you could be running $300 million of
premium there over the course of this year, could you just give us a little bit more color as
to how many of these portfolios contributed towards that combined ratio and the 116
combined and should we be thinking about that reversing into '18?

A - Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

So I certainly don't expect the premium to be anything like what you just said James, I
think should we expect some level of premium reduction in Asia, yes, I think as we go
through that it's inevitable. So the '18 portfolio is all contributed to some degree in the 115,
the biggest half of the -- if you do the math, we had about $100 million underwriting loss
in Asia, half of that came from Hong Kong workers comp. So our job is to prove that by

not rushing construction business going forward, dealing with the claims handling better,
having booked at the reserving that we're not going to repeat on that going forward.
Then you have got the other $50 million which is a higher level of frequency across a
number of portfolios, marine, property, by market you've got a bit of Hong Kong, a bit of
Singapore and a bit of Indonesia, that will be the major markets to do. So we just need to
get a bit better at all of those really.

Q - James Coghill

{BIO 14006200 <GO>}

Just to clarify that. So the Hong Kong the workers comp and I'm not -- now you are going
to say yes to this. But you are pretty confident that you've adequately reserved at the end
of '17 is a lot of variability around how that runoff portfolio, for want of a better expression
could perform, is there a lot of variability or do you thinkâ€¦

A - Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

No. We think we have reserved well at the end of '17. I mean there are a few moving parts,
there's been a few moving parts on how we have handled those claims internally to QBE
and there's been a bit in the market as well in the workers comp market in Hong Kong
that have inflated cost. But we think we're on top of all of that.

Q - Ross Curran

{BIO 17605313 <GO>}

It's Ross Curran here from Deutsche Bank. Just a follow up to James' question on the
buyback. When you said the run rate is similar, are we -- I thought originally there was a
cap on an annual buyback of $330 million odd, is that still the cap or are you going to
catch up the $200 million a year shortfall. So are we going to buy back $850 million of
shares over next two years or is it stillâ€¦

A - Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

In terms of, I think I said the $330 million for 2018.

Q - Ross Curran

{BIO 17605313 <GO>}

So that's an $800 million effectively odd buyback in total run, is thatâ€¦

A - Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

No. I think. So the $1 billion still stands and our intention this year will be to do $330 million.

Q - Ross Curran

{BIO 17605313 <GO>}

Then pick up the shortfall in FY '19?

A - Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Well pick up the shortfall in FY '19 or the early part of FY '20, I wasn't more specific on
that.

Then just secondly on Dan's question around the guidance including the LatAm sale. Can
you talk through because the LatAm investment assets tend to be high yielding assets
than the (inaudible), can you talk through the impact of a run yield of dropping the LatAm
assets out of the portfolio, going forward?

FINAL

A - Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Yes. So I think on both the combined ratio, if you excluded LatAm out of the combined
ratio and out of the investment yield, it is curiously a similar impact to both, which is
somewhere in the region of 20 to 25 basis points. So if you deduct both from both.

Q - Ross Curran

{BIO 17605313 <GO>}

Then finally, you've talked a bit in presentation about investments in market data and
analytics, are we still again -- in terms of OpEx into next year, are we talking a step up in
OpEx to catch up on this market data investments, is that how we should thinking about
it?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Yes. So -- no, I didn't mean yes, we aren't going to. I think there're some areas we need
to invest in. I think David and Michael would agree, there is equally some areas we need
to save money in as well. So we've talked in the detail of the financials about our expense
ratio being somewhat flat in '18 and I would kind of think about that as us needing to
invest in a number of areas, whether it will data analytics and or some of the Brilliant
Basics capabilities as well as saving in a number of areas as well. So expect us to do both.
I think beyond that, I think it is reasonable that we should reduce our expense ratio, I think
that is something that Dave has got in his mind and certainly in his mandate and that
should deliver a lower expense ratio as well as a lower dollars of expenses going forward.
As I mentioned super briefly in my speech, we will talk to you a little bit more specifically
about that going forward.

Q - Brett Le Mesurier

{BIO 5909278 <GO>}

Brett Le Mesurier from Shaw. You showed us what the -- or you told us about the risk
margin change was in the outstanding claims liabilities. But there is no comment on
premium liabilities, can you comment on what movements have been made in that risk
margin?

Kieren Chidgey, UBS. Just a follow-up questions on cost, the LatAm sale, what are the sort
of expected separation of costs as a result of that and also in terms of stranded costs
from an ongoing point of view, what should we be thinking about?

FINAL

A - Michael J. T. Ford

{BIO 17494941 <GO>}

Yes, look, we have stranded costs, not a lot, there are some. But they're not significant.
We have called that a profit on sale in the release, which considers what the cost of
buying, or the transaction cost.

Q - Kieren Chidgey

{BIO 7268946 <GO>}

So the separation costs are within that profit number?

A - Michael J. T. Ford

{BIO 17494941 <GO>}

That's right.

Q - Kieren Chidgey

{BIO 7268946 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Just secondly, on the group underwriting performance path, the way you break down the
divisions regionally excludes sort of that corporate line which I notice in the (stat) accounts
book to $90 million underwriting loss. So can you just talk to us sort of why that was so
elevated at this period?

A - Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Nothing specific I talked to in this period. I mean generally speaking we've got obviously a
few things going on incrementally in Equator this year particularly because of the cat
losses. Going forward, we should be the sum of the divisions plus Equator equals group.

Q - Kieren Chidgey

{BIO 7268946 <GO>}

And my question was sort of not around Equator or with the group excluding Equator I
think you call it corporate, another?

A - Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

I think that would only be expenses or more so in the -- so we had 1 or 2 one-off expenses
in the underwriting line of corporate.

Q - Kieren Chidgey

FINAL

Toby Langley from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The conditions that you talked to in the
final quarter of last calendar year and those that you see today, is the right interpretation
to suggest as upside risk to your guidance or are you sitting on those conditions when you
put those out.

A - Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Look it would kind of very silly of me sit here and say there's upside risks to our guidance
at this point in time. I think -- and there's a long way to go still in the year. All of us are very
curious as to how pricing will evolve in all of the major markets, North America, Europe. It
has not been as firm in some areas, reinsurance rate increases are not as much as people
thought, it's a little bit better in some other areas, our international markets business for
example. But it's very early on, very early days for that, it has been kind of okay so far. But
it's only -- it's not even the First Quarter yet.

Q - Toby Langley

{BIO 15924432 <GO>}

Then if we can just come back on your point around there is quite a lot of not
unconnected targets here, you have got your debt-equity ratio, you've got your PCA
target.

A - Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes.

Q - Toby Langley

{BIO 15924432 <GO>}

You still want to make your buyback commitment. And this year we can see some capital
coming in the door. But -- help us be a bit creative here, what else do we need to see for
you to tick all of those boxes and -- sat here next year having achieved all of those?

A - Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Not a lot really. On the PCA we get a benefit from LatAm so our 1.64 goes up a bit that
gets us pretty close to the middle of our range without doing anything else. We're already
in pretty good shape and then you add a little bit for S&P so that's sort of good. Cash
remittance, as Michael said, are good and that leaves us with a healthy amount of cash at
the center, we have obviously added or will add later this year $400 million to that. So that
gives us some flexibility on what we do with that. So they will be the main components.

Q - Ashley Dalziell

{BIO 20853789 <GO>}

Ashley Dalziell from Goldman Sachs. Just a question on investments. So you suggested
the asset generation was sort of hovering in the one and a half to 2-year range, this year
but beyond that is there still a aspiration to better match the balance sheet?

A - Michael J. T. Ford

{BIO 17494941 <GO>}

Over time potentially but in the next 12 months just between one and a half, two years we
are quite comfortable we've given the shape of the current curves.

FINAL

Yes, I mean just sort of, we've been sitting at QBE for a long while hoping for interest rate
rises. So it may be that we're finally on the cusp of that, again let's see, I mean let's see
how that plays out. Ultimately, we will only match asset and liability duration, when there is
-- we return it to a more normal interest rate environment, then nothing new. Anymore?

Q - Unidentified Participant
(Mark Hancroft from Percept). Just I don't know if you've talked about reinsurance but
assume you have been looking at the program since the end of last year and you might
have made some changes and can you just talk to sort of the cost of the program but
also the benefits and the sort of the bad parallel losses we encountered last year that
likely to be more immunized under what you've may have undertaken?

A - Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Yes. So the good news was that 50% of our program was pre-placed for 2018 it's
probably more than 50% because the aggregate treaty was already placed. So we've
gone through and placed the rest of the program with actually minimal increase in cost. So
the team did a nice job of that. The structure of the program is very, very similar from '18
as it was in '17, I think we noted there's a slight increase in the attachment point for the
aggregate treaty, which we factored in to our guidance. So it's a very similar treaty and
actually, the incremental costs was pretty minimal.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Unidentified Participant
So would you be on risk for the same parallel losses if they were paid this year?

A - Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

I think we've talked about before that on the aggregate treaty we buy that gives us a lot
of protection so that for 19 out of 20 years you would expect large risk events and cat
events we completely contained in the limits of the treaty. Last year's estimated, I don't
know there is a 1 in 50, 1 in 60-year type of events. So obviously when you've got that it
goes outside of everybody's reinsurance treaties and it's incremental cost for everybody
and we were no different to that. The core structure of the program is essentially the
same in '18 as it was in '17. So if it was another 1 on 50 or 1 in 60 years then yes that would
have an impact.

Q - Unidentified Participant
And just a question on the tax rate you said it would be slightly lower -- actually you didn't
say slightly, you said it will be lower than 20. But do you mean slightly low or do you mean
there is a lot significant amount of tax losses arising from 2017 say tax could be negligible.

A - Patrick C. Regan

No I mean slightly lower, slightly lower. I think we have a call on the telephone, David.

Yes, 2 questions just from me. Firstly, on your growth in specialty in North America you
have asked in the past that -- capabilities you think you have when you (inaudible) you
have got a good handle on risk selection and project control, what content can you give
us on the growth in the (inaudible) liability?

A - Patrick C. Regan

{BIO 15131018 <GO>}

Yes, David, it's a good question, I asked for a specific bit of work to look at that over the
last couple of months just to make sure that the new business we're adding was the right
quality and our reserves were the right levels as well. So there's nothing to flag that came
out of that work. I would say to you that we're going to be growing at a much lower rate
on that going forward, probably the only place in the world where in 2018 there is not rate
available is in that kind of professional lines market. So I think the team has done a decent
job building the book of business we've got but I think the rate of growth going forward
will be much more modest.

Q - David J. Humphreys

Okay, second question just looking at your underwriting accounts, your unplaced business
has increased by $130 million it now represents about 8% of GWP that seems odd in the

premium receivables. There is no specific trends on that to highlight, I don't think.
