Capital; Duncan Finch, MD of Insurance; Mike Bury, MD of Digital Savings; and last but
certainly not least, sitting right next to me, Mark Zinkula, CEO of LGIM.
Today's strong numbers show we are growing our business stock. LGIM assets and
annuity assets are up, and because of this, we delivered record cash generation at the
three-quarter year point. Top-line numbers are: operational cash up 11% to £936 million,
net cash up 14% to £943 million, LGIM assets under management up 8% to £717 billion,
annuity assets also up 8% at £43.1 billion, savings asset up 2% to £104.9 billion, UK
Protection premium up 3% to £1.109 billion, and direct investments up 43% to £6.6 billion.
Turning to our businesses and starting with LGR, Q3 was a quieter quarter for bulks with
£92 million of completions, meaning £1.5 billion of total annuity sales year-to-date. Our
bulk pipeline remained strong. The expansion of our bulk annuity business internationally
is a big strategic opportunity for LGR. We entered the U.S. pension risk transfer market in
October with a $450 million bulk deal with Philips, and our progressing plans to enter the
European market in the next few months.
Our new Lifetime Mortgage business is exceeding our expectations. The application is
now running at around £10 million per week from a standing start earlier this year. And
we're targeting to write up to £200 million by the end of this year. Going forward, we
believe more and more people will access the housing equity to help finance their
retirement.

Bloomberg Transcript

LGIM is now ranked the 15th largest global asset manager in the Towers Watson research
published this week.
External net flows are £21.7 billion excludes the £13 billion National Grid Pension Scheme
mandate win announced in September, which we'll receive the assets this month. LGIM's
international expansion continues at a pace and it's been led by LGIM America. LGIM's
Asia business is also making progress with mandate wins in Korea, Taiwan, and we've just
entered Japan.
In the UK, our retail funds business continues to make significant progress moving up into
the top three of UK net retail fund sales in Q3. Workplace pensions also grew strongly
with assets under administration up 30% to £13.1 billion, with further significant mandate
yet to fund. These newly won schemes would add a further 700,000 people to our
existing 1.4 million customers by the end of next year.
LGC's investments are focused on four key areas, where we believe limited institutional
finance have created attractive investment opportunities. They are housing, urban
regeneration, alternative finance and clean energy. Notable investments so far this year in
the urban regeneration space include first phases of a £400 million investment in Cardiff
and an initial investment of £162 million in Leeds.
In total, direct investments were up 43% on last year at £6.6 billion and we anticipate by
then at least two more urban regeneration deals in the next six months.

FINAL

Legal & General Insurance increased its UK Protection premium by 3% year-on-year to
£1.109 billion, maintaining its position as the largest provider in the retail market. Our
Savings business, which comprises digital and mature savings, increased its assets under
administration by 2% year-on-year to £104.9 billion.
As you know, we closed our with-profits fund to new business in January and are
identifying cost efficiencies to compensate for the gradually declining asset base.
Cofunds generated net flows of £2.6 billion with total assets under administration up 6%
at £73.1 billion.
L&G America delivered year-to-date sales of $86 million in line with guidance at the time
of our interim results, where we said we expect new business volumes to be circa 25%
lower than for 2015 compared to 2014.
L&G America is important to the expansion of the group in the U.S. providing back-office
support to LGR and the balance sheet providing further U.S. pension risk transfer business.
I'm pleased to say we're ahead of our group-wide target to deliver operating cost savings
of £80 million reducing cost from £1.25 billion in 2014.

Bloomberg Transcript

And finally, Solvency II, as you know, we've applied to the PRA to use our internal model to
calculate our Solvency Capital Requirement, transitionals, matching adjustment, and
deduction and aggregation for L&G America. Whilst we've not yet received any feedback
in respect to the PRA's decisions, we do expect to obtain approval for these applications.
We'll report our Solvency II capital position for the first time as part of our full-year results
in March 2016.
So to quickly sum up, our stock (05:44) business and cash are up. Our business has
momentum, and we have further growth opportunities.
So now, I'll open the call to questions.

Q&A
Operator
Our first question today comes from the line of Oliver Steel from Deutsche Bank. Oliver,
please go ahead.

Q - Oliver G. Steel

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

Good morning, Mark. Good morning, everyone. Three questions to start with. It's sort of
difficult to know where to start actually with your numbers today. But can you talk a bit
more as to why the third quarter cash flow appear to accelerate? I think there's been a
rebasing of your assumptions in some of the insurance businesses, as well as underlying
momentum elsewhere. Why have you rebased those assumptions upwards? So, what's
going on there? So that's question one.

Page 3 of 24



Company N ame: L egal & General Group PL C
Company Ticker: L GEN L N Equity
Date: 2015-11-04

Secondly, on the new business trend, given how little bulk annuity business you wrote in
the quarter, it seems a surprisingly positive strained figure. And I'm wondering if that's
been driven by either cost savings or maybe the equity release sales that you're
generating.

FINAL

And then thirdly, if you're now writing bulk annuity business in the States, what does that
imply for the U.S. dividend to the holding company?

A - Mark J. Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

Okay. I think probably for the first time I'm taking all those three questions myself. But
actually, I'd share the questions out beyond that. So in terms of kind of the Q3 cash flow
progression of cash at 11% (07:34) at a three-quarter-year point in terms of what's going
on now. I think, seriously there are kind of contributing factors there, Oliver, no one being
in isolation. So, clearly in terms of the deployments of the non-insurance businesses
clearly within that result, we've got LGIM's profits in there, so we're bringing up LGIM on a
post-tax operating profit basis, now clearly LGIM as you can see from the numbers, is
trading well and clearly, that's had some benefits.

Bloomberg Transcript

The likes of our General Insurance business, Q3 has been a reasonably benign period for
claims. So, again, in terms of we bring our GI business again in an operating profit after tax
basis, so again, that's had some benefit.
And we have gone back and just revisited, as we do every year, just to make sure our
calculation of expected release from our Insurance businesses is exactly where it's
possible. And again, this year we've done that and it has revealed bits of prudence, which
we'll work on – not in the initial assessment, which we have brought into the calculation at
Q3. Again, no one factor per se, Oliver, that's driving the increase, just some of the
(08:30) and they're all pretty much going in the same direction. Hence, we've got a
reasonable uplift overall, but no one thing in isolation.
On the new business surplus and your comment that it's suprisingly positive given the low
volumes, you're quite right. Clearly, volumes were massive particularly in the bulk space in
Q3. But again, in your question, you've kind of hinted, they're kind of actually the main
reasons we have seen benefit in the net cash, in the new business surplus is down to two
main factors.
Firstly, as I say, we have been covering a pretty strong rebase of our cost base during the
course of 2015. (09:07) but that will come through as an experience there into year-end.
But for new business, we do get benefit of any unit cost benefits, do get factored into the
calculation of new business trading or surplus. So, it depends which of those cost savings
have impacted and benefit the new business. You are getting that benefit through the
new business surplus calculation.
(09:30) you alluded to in your question, we do allocate the Lifetime Mortgage asset
volumes to new business in LGR and, therefore, tends which we get enhanced spread by
credit governance in that space. That additional spread does come through and boost the
new business surplus associated with the year-to-date (09:56). It's not just about what's
Page 4 of 24

Company Ticker: L GEN L N Equity
Date: 2015-11-04

FINAL

happened in Q3. We allocate that based on the year-to-date new business volumes in
annuity. Again, that's been a positive factor there.
To the bulk annuities, and yes, clearly, it's very early days. I just say we are rising that
through the U.S. business. I think at this stage, no one deal will make a difference in that
regard but clearly in time, as we grow the U.S. balance sheet and as that business grows
profitably, then we would expect that to be a benefit to dividend. But again, I wouldn't
expect that to be a short-term benefit all over that. That's one – obviously, as we grow
that general account in the U.S. and that's when we get the benefit in due course. It's not
going to be a day-one benefit in terms of immediate dividend increases from the U.S.
business as a result of U.S. bulk annuity transactions.

Q - Oliver G. Steel

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

Just to come back on that, would this imply any reduction in the dividends short term?

A - Mark J. Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

I wouldn't read that into it either.

Q - Oliver G. Steel

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Our next question on the phone today comes from Andrew Sinclair from Bank of America
Merrill Lynch. Andrew, please go ahead.

Q - Andrew J. Sinclair

{BIO 17749036 <GO>}

Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just three quick questions as usual. Firstly, you seem to
be winning a few workplace benefit schemes recently. I just wondered, have you seen any
pickup in re-broking of schemes as we approach the (11:09) and therefore, next year?
Secondly, just wonder if you could give us an update on pensions de-risking pipeline and
how activity is varying between the UK, U.S. and Europe. And thirdly, I realize it's just a
trading update today but I just wondered if you could give any comments on the PRA's
commentary yesterday, which seemed relatively positive for Solvency II? Thanks.

A - Mark J. Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

Okay. Cheers, Andy. So I think Zink could pick up the one on workplace, any re-broking
activity in the market. Kerrigan picks up the one on pension de-risking then and I'll come
back on your question on Sam Wood's speech yesterday.

A - Mark J. Zinkula

{BIO 16142450 <GO>}

Yeah, no material change, I think, in activity. It's going to be somewhat sporadic, but I
wouldn't say there's any material change. A couple of comments first on de-risking before
Page 5 of 24

FINAL

handing over to Kerrigan, because obviously, there's a continuum (12:08) strategies
before some kind of longevity offloading solution.
But we are continuing – again, it depends on – as equity markets rally and/or race back up,
it's a very volatile equity markets, but obviously to the extent one or both – we're in a
situation where one or both of those environments exist. We will see incrementally an
increase in de-risking activity in the LDI pipeline because it impacts on the status of those
clients looking to implement de-risking strategies. I'll hand over to Kerrigan to talk about
the bulk annuity market.

A - Kerrigan Procter

{BIO 15093363 <GO>}

Well, I think that's true on both the UK and the U.S. side and on Europe for the end. We
got early signs of what's going on on pensions de-risking space through the LDI
businesses and LDI business in the UK and the U.S., and there's absolutely no letup in
client demand, if anything, an acceleration of – a continuous acceleration of clients wanting
to de-risk and de-risk all the way through to buy-in or buy-out.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, yes, it's still a very exciting market. The pipeline – our pipeline in the market, pipeline is
still strong, as you can see from the Q3 figures. Difficult to predict exactly when those
land, but it's a strong pipeline. And our competitive strength in the UK and the U.S.
markets, I think particularly the UK market currently is substantial.
Just a touch on the U.S. market. There really is a strong pipeline in that U.S. market. We are
currently on a lot of deals there. And that looks like it's going to be strong into next year
also. So the U.S. market is – along with the UK market – particularly exciting.
Europe, there's definitely some business to be done in Europe, selectively in the
Netherlands in particular. We're very keen to participate in that market. We have the
capability, longevity stature and the asset management capability and the administration
capability to do that. And we're hopeful that we can demonstrate that to you soon.

A - Mark J. Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks, Kerrigan. Just on Sam Wood's speech yesterday again. I'm sure everyone
saw it that Sam gave a speech to the AVI yesterday where he picked up some further
comments on Solvency II. Andy, we take that as being positive comments? Actually, there
was a lot of stuff he chose to say about the way the risk margins have been offered, I
think the fact that he's recognized that we probably have created a non-level playing field
there between Europe and the rest of it would probably be a good thing I think after that.
Also that I think he recognizes that the interest rate sensitivity, the risk margin calculation
has made it more volatile and people are expecting, I think, generally, probably the risk
margin again being bigger that perhaps the PRA expected when the concept first got
constructed. So, I think, in that sense, the fact that – looking at kind of what's happened
and how it's playing out, in fact, I think that's a beneficial thing for ourselves and other
people particularly in the annuity market going forward.

I think one thing I would take exceptionally in Sam Wood's speech, he clearly, at one point,
referenced that he was worried about whether the use of longevity reinsurance would
actually reduce rather an enhance policyholder protection. Again, Sam is obviously not
making close (15:16) how these swaps work in practice. But I would make the point that
these longevity swaps are fully collateralized. They are essentially contracts with
difference. We pay a float in there and we receive – so, we pay a fixed (15:28) and we
received a floating (15:56) in return based on the actual longevity experience. But that
difference is fully collateralized.
So, I would strongly disagree with his comment or his inference that maybe in some way,
longevity reinsurance weakens the policyholder protection. I would strongly refute that's
the case. But again, that issue aside, I think the commentary that Sam came up with
yesterday was entirely helpful and we look forward to taking that debate going forward,
but again, I'm not expecting any material change before 1 January 2016.

Q - Andrew J. Sinclair

Our next question on the phone today comes from Fahad Changazi from Nomura. Fahad,
please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Fahad U. Changazi

{BIO 15216120 <GO>}

Hello. Good morning. Could I just chase up on the BOE (16:11) comments on the U.S. bulk
pipeline? First of all, given they have a different capital regime versus what we'll have
here, do you see any regulatory arbitrage where their people believe to undercut you and
how will you respond to that in the U.S., firstly?
And then second, on the BOE (16:26) comments again, they were talking about non-EU
companies participating in the UK market. Now, I think you also mentioned reinsurers as
well, and I know some of your panel is U.S. reinsurers, so again, could you just comment
on that and how you see that developing?
And the final thing is on the LGIM, it's doing very strongly. And even the index funds have
net inflows for nine months. Could you just again remind us of what we should be
expecting for the index flows going forward given that we're going through a de-risking
journey in the UK? Thanks.

A - Mark J. Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks, Fahad. I think, if you don't mind, Kerrigan, pick up those first two, these
questions, and obviously, Zink, pick up the LGIM index, even index flows are up. Even
(17:10). Go on, Kerrigan.

FINAL

Yeah. So, you spoke about (17:13) different capital regime. Cleary, that's one of the
reasons we're applying for a level playing field, deduction in aggregation in the U.S. So,
that's clearly an interesting market to play in with the different capital regime. I mean,
probably that's all there is to say on that point.
Clearly, linked to your second question in terms of the UK market, frankly, it's in the deals
that we've done that there's a flow of longevity risks, particularly with the risk margin in
mind but not talking about it from Europe to North American reinsurers and we
recognized that exception that we're actively participating in that. So it gets a good result
for our clients and increases our return on capital. So, that looks like a sensible thing to
participate in and get involved with and just recognize that effect.
You talked a bit about – you mentioned about you take more, you're taking companies
involved in the UK market. I mean, just some interesting activities there, a real positive but
more reinsurers want to get involved in on the longevity side of that market. So, I see that
as a positive. It's a healthy market, plenty of client demand, reasonable competition but
not too much.
So, I feel that is a positive vibrant market actually.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark J. Zinkula

{BIO 16142450 <GO>}

In relation to LGIM's business, we are seeing as you point out, increasing positive
momentum in virtually all parts of the business which is encouraging. It's obviously that can
be a straight line in all these markets. But we are at the breadth of the – the strength of
the results is really encouraging.
With respect to the index business specifically which you asked about, we do expect to
continue to see outflows in the UK DB market because we have mostly passive equity
assets. That's what's the continuation of the trend that you're now seeing for several
years and that will continue but we are executing better. We invested heavily in the
business in regards to expanding the distribution of the index capabilities more broadly.
So, we're seeing increasing flows in retail. We'd expect that to continue. We're much
more competitive in that space now.
In defined contribution market, again a lot of these assets are coming in as part of multiasset funds but the underlying funds are – majority of those funds are an underlying index
funds. The package is part of multi-asset solutions for the DC market. And then
internationally we've entered the U.S. market, starting to see – this is our first year in the
U.S. market and starting to win mandates. We have a few clients now and getting seeding
for funds. And so, we do expect to see an acceleration of growth there.
And in Europe and Asia, there's positive momentum as well. Money is a bit depressed,
some of the sudden wealth funds have had – well, ultimately, we've had net outflows to
some funds, as well as other managers. So, again, it's never going to be a positive
momentum in all markets at all time. But broadly speaking, we do hope to expect to –
again, it's not going to be every quarter, but the trajectory would be a positive net flow
situation going forward.

FINAL

One other thing, just mention also, our product offering, we've expanded its multi-asset
funds and leveraging the index capabilities. There's building blocks for a growing array of
multi-asset funds for the DC in retail marketing, increasingly DB, but also product
development in alternative data space. So, the types of funds that we are offering is
expanding and we expect to continue to evolve our product offering in the range of
(20:34) into the alternative data space going forward.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Operator
I'll do the traditional three questions. The first two is on the net capital generation. You
mentioned in your opening remarks that one of the key factors today was better results
(21:09) at LGIM. The run rate – I mean, when I modeled it, I looked to the run rate of LGIM
in the first half and I considered that the cash flows had really started improving in the
second quarter. But equity markets are down and your costs were controlled. All things
equal, that wouldn't have justified the jump in the run rate that you've seen. I mean, what
exactly has caused the quarter-on-quarter jump rate in LGIM? That's the first question – in
LGIM's contribution on ICT (21:40).
Second one is on the GI side. Did you have any large prior-year leases in the third quarter?
And then my third question is when you look at your economic capital model and you strip
out one-offs, you adjust for the fact that you're actually trying to run an AA calibration or a
BBB calibration. It doesn't look like you – even at the current run rate, you're not – you're
basically consuming all the capital that's been released off the back book. I mean, what is
the capacity to grow a box and will take on a few large or super bulks in the short term? I
was struggling to understand that.

A - Mark J. Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks, Greg (22:17). I'll pick up – probably I'll go all three and then perhaps let
Kerrigan add a bit of color to the last one. And in terms of my answer earlier to the
question from Oliver, kind of where the growth in the cash has come from, I wasn't
implying that it all comes from (22:37) there's been a number of positive. Actually there's
some – pretty much all these variances went in the same direction this time around.

Page 9 of 24



Company N ame: L egal & General Group PL C
Company Ticker: L GEN L N Equity
Date: 2015-11-04

Hence, we've ended up with a reasonably meaningful growth in the operational cash
growth year-on-year.

FINAL

So, I wasn't implying for a second that all of the delta you've calculated in your
spreadsheet break this down to LGIM or GI or I should be saying that it so happened this
time around that all our variances were in the same direction, hence, we ended up with a
reasonable outperformance as a result.
So, we clearly haven't given a divisional breakdown of cash generation. Clearly, this is a
trading update. We do, of course, we try to give a bit of color around cash of Q1 and Q3,
but we don't give a divisional breakdown. So, I'll say the kind of final profit number and this
update for our prelims in March, if you don't mind.

Bloomberg Transcript

A lot goes on GI and nothing untoward there. I hinted in my answer a little bit that we have
a pretty benign Q3. In reality, we'd expect kind of – mostly at Q2 and Q3 be pretty benign
because that's what the weather does in the summer. But it's been a pretty quiet sort of
quarter and therefore, that has benefited GI. But again, nothing untoward going on in
terms of fundings in terms of prior releases, et cetera. That's not part of that equation.
On the capital consumption point of bulk, clearly, we are – we said that very clearly at the
interims this year, we are very focused now on our capitalized model for annuities and are
very aware this is about optimizing our return on capital. I wouldn't say it's then to do with
any sort of capital constraint. We're simply as a capital deploy, and we're making sure we
get adequate return for the capital we deploy. And that's about all times making sure we
have the optimum capital model to do that. You shouldn't interpret that as a mean that
we've got some sort of capital (24:14) in terms of what we can and can't afford to. It's
simply making sure that when we do deploy capital, we get an adequate return for our
shareholders for doing so.
Kerrigan, do you want to add to that in any way?

A - Kerrigan Procter

{BIO 15093363 <GO>}

Just in terms of super bulks, there are and there will be super bulk deals out there if the
price is right and the average return on capital, in particular, is right. Then we're still very
interested in those deals. So, as Mark said, I wouldn't read anything into Q3 figures
beyond just quite all.

Jon, please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Jon M. Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Morning, everybody. Just had a couple of questions on bulks. I just wondered what your
ratio is going to be in terms of capitalizing the U.S. units and how you think about rate of
returns on capital sort of U.S. versus Europe.
And then secondly, the comment in the release about sort of further internationalizing
bulk. When you talk about Europe, is that Ireland or is that Netherlands? Thank you.

A - Mark J. Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

Right. Do you want to answer, Kerrigan?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kerrigan Procter

{BIO 15093363 <GO>}

Yeah. Sure. I mean, interesting pipeline in the U.S. as we talked about. In a question earlier
we talked about – referred to it a different capital regime, which of course it is. So, the
capital consumption is different between the EU and Europe. What we have is we've all
talked about a consistent return on capital metric, and we will apply that. And we can
choose whether we want to do U.S. deals or UK deals. I think the important thing is that
we have that choice and we look across both of those things equally and you'll be able to
tell which looks more attractive for us by the deals we write effectively.

Q - Jon M. Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Sorry. You have to sort of pump (26:02) on the U.S. legal entity or how should we think
about locating capital in the U.S.?

A - Mark J. Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

I'll pick it up. We're not anticipating a material increase in the capitalization of the U.S.
business. We are giving too much away, Jon. L&G America, our insurance business there
has very, very long mortality. The term insurance writer currently, certainly in terms of the
(26:27) basis in the U.S. Writing more longevity business in that insurance business is a very
good diversifier. So, we're not anticipating, certainly for the first leg of growth in the
(26:50) space in the U.S. to have any material impact on the capital requirement of that
U.S. business.

A - Kerrigan Procter

{BIO 15093363 <GO>}

So, just a follow up on Mark's U.S. point. What proportion in mortality is actually reinsured
in the U.S.? What proportion do you keep on your balance sheets?

FINAL

A - Mark J. Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

We have to build on the UK. So, in the U.S., we have an excess reinsurance cover basis. So,
above a certain line, I'm not giving that number away. But if we are to show above a
certain amount, we'll reinsure that to reinsurance market. So, we do retain a reasonable
mortality risk on our U.S. balance sheet.

Q - Gordon Aitken

{BIO 3846728 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning. A couple of questions on bulks, please. First, just to follow-up, when you
said the bulk pipeline remained strong but I would expect you to say that ahead of Q4.
And it's a very seasonal market, this one, the sales mostly in Q4. I'm just wondering, is
there an added driver in 2015 due to Solvency II? I mean, the consultants I spoke to a few
months ago were certainly pushing trustees to make decisions then in order to get
Solvency I pricing.
And secondly, so, in the Dutch market, I mean, it's obviously a different market to the UK
and the U.S. and that insurance companies have, in the past, taken on pre and postretirement liabilities. They even take on active members, in fact. I'm just wondering what
your strategy will be there. Thanks.

A - Kerrigan Procter

{BIO 15093363 <GO>}

Yeah. Sure. On the first point, we're not seeing a huge pickup into Q4. I think rationally,
you would say, trustees probably should've hurried up and got things done before the
implementation of Solvency II and the removal of the transitional relief.
But really, from the trustees' point of view, the potential price increase going for next year
doesn't look that substantial in the face of big equity market moves or interest rate
moves. So, they haven't actually, other than a few odd cases, really got (28:44) to close
this year.
So, I'm not expecting a big pickup in market volumes in Q4, particularly. I mean, give or
take, there'll be a couple of super-bulk deals in there possibly.
Then on the Dutch model, on the Dutch market, we're really interested in pension and
deferred. They're not really active members but pricing as well, UK and U.S. payout
businesses, it's that long-stream of virtually well-known cash flows going out we're
Page 12 of 24

interested in so we can apply our asset management strategy to that. So, it's a bit similar
pension or deferred pension market that we're interested in in the Netherlands.

Our next question today is from Colm Kelly from UBS. Colm, please go ahead.

Q - Colm Kelly

{BIO 19140684 <GO>}

Good morning. I have three question, please. On UK bulk, if we look year-to-date, you've
written £1.25 billion. But if we take out the additional tranches of the ICI bulk scheme that
you wrote in Q1 2014, that looks like it's closer to roughly £250 million of bulks from new
pension schemes, new to L&G. So, clearly, it's volatile, but can you give some color
specifics on why you think it's a lot quieter than you expect in the context of industry
consultants tipping the bulk annuity market in the UK to hit close to £10 billion by full year?

Bloomberg Transcript

Secondly, on U.S. pension risk transfer opportunity. Obviously, you're positive in the
outlook there. Can you give some color on any targets you have in place for that business
and maybe any color on the return on equity capital shareholders can expect to achieve
on that business over time?
And thirdly, do you expect to maintain IFRS cash generation as a key metric to kind of
communicate cash going forward? Clearly, there's two big changes taking place, Solvency
II and we're seeing peers move to other Solvency II (30:06) surplus-cash-type numbers.
But we've also further down the line the new accounting standard, IFRS 4 Phase II, and
there is a particular provision within that to spread profits on any contact over the full
duration of the contract, which seem to constrain the ability to recognize more profit upfront on the annuity business over the long term. So, is IFRS net cash the right metric to
judge cash on or can we expect that to be changed and then have that communicated
going forward? Thank you.

A - Mark J. Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks, Colm. I'll again ask Kerrigan to get the first one about any more color he
can give on the UK pipeline and market this year. I'll pick up the one point on the U.S.
return on equity targets and indeed your question about cash metrics going forward.

A - Kerrigan Procter

{BIO 15093363 <GO>}

Yeah. Just on the UK bulk pipeline of volume, I mean, as you'll know well from the figures,
a lot of it is dominated by, I think, fixed rates super bulks. I mean, look at our deals last
year, ICI, TRW, a lot of the volume is dominated by that. We've had a pretty steady flow of
small- to medium-sized bulks this year, that's really great business for us. It has been a
great business for us. I think whether or not it hits the consultants' target of £10 billion to
the end of the year, will depend on whether a couple of super-bulk deals out there will

Page 13 of 24



Company N ame: L egal & General Group PL C
Company Ticker: L GEN L N Equity
Date: 2015-11-04

close or not. So, it's just the fact that that headline volume of £10 billion that's given to you
(32:23) by the consultants is dominated by a couple of super-bulk deals, I think.

FINAL

A - Mark J. Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks, Kerrigan. In terms of the U.S. pension risk transfer market and any targets
we might have, our only target, Colm, is to make sure we maintain our return on
economic capital pricing basis. So, the only matter here is making sure we get the
adequate return we expect to get when we deploy capital into that market. So, we have
no kind of volume targets per se. Clearly, every time we expect that market to be
material for us but we don't set short-term targets and telling us to go when and write
only one quarter, only one year. We are absolutely disciplined to make sure that when we
deploy capital, we get the returns we want from that capital deployment. So that's
absolutely our target is to achieve that return.
In terms of kind of metrics going forward, I do expect us and we do plan to maintain our
existing IFRS cash generation metrics going into the future, not least because as you say
in your question, Colm, we are going to see another change yet again in the future. When
finally we're going to get IFRS 4 Phase 2, the new insurance liabilities standard, wherever
it comes in probably now it's going to be 2024 (33:34) it comes in. I'm very, very keen we
don't end up kind of changing metrics kind of three times in the space of five years.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, it is definitely my plan to maintain our existing cash definitions going forward, and we
all then reconcile those back to, say, the new Solvency II balance sheet going forward as
well. So, you can kind of see how the things interact.
But I think in terms of consistency, I'm very keen to maintain the cash metrics we have in
the organization already. And when, if and when IFRS 4 comes in in four or five years'
time, we'll take the stuff in exactly what that means in terms of the metrics. But for now,
I'm keen to maintain consistency.

Hi. Good morning, all. Could I come back to the first question and could you enumerate
the third element of cash generation? You talked about one-off releases in the third

whether you think you're growing share or whether after many years, growing share, you
seem no longer to be so?

Page 14 of 24



Company N ame: L egal & General Group PL C

And then thirdly, I'd like you to talk, if you could candidly, about the savings business, which
I don't see that you broke out as a separate division. You closed the with-profit business.
It's been rumored in the press that you've been trying to sell Cofunds funds and Suffolk
Life. I mean, what is the overarching strategy towards these businesses going forward?

FINAL

A - Mark J. Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks, Andrew. I'll pick up the first one around your comment on one-off releases
in the Q3 numbers. Obviously, Duncan can pick up any comments on the protection
market, and I'll ask Mike Bury just to comment on – it's actually the Cofunds and Suffolk
Life.
In terms of – an enumeration of kind of the – (35:11) I want to give at this point, Andrew. I
would – again, I would just comment against the expression of one-off releases. This is a –
just a – as we do every year, we just go back and make – as we get more information to
go through the year, we just go back and we make sure the accurate calculation of (35:25)
goes through into the cash number.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, you shouldn't see us to be in the kind of a funny one-off. This is simply a – yes, it's
coming through in Q3 numbers, but it is essentially a year-to-date impact from the
recalculation of the expected release. We're just looking at where the prudence are
coming from and making sure we got that property modeled. And as we get to the end
of the year, we have a clearer definition of kind of what's actually come through by way of
prudent releases during the course of that year. No more than that, is this is not some
odd accounting going on in that one-off and actually it's an extra] (35:54) we do every
year.

Q - Andrew J. Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

No, I just wanted the number, actually. I didn't say it was funny.

A - Mark J. Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

Yeah. And I'm not going to give it to you, Andrew. Year-end, you'll get the full breakdown
as always, the divisional cash breakdown, and then we'll be – you'll be able to see where
the – which divisions has generated what cash generation in the year. But until then, you
have to wait until March.

A - Duncan Finch

{BIO 18966514 <GO>}

Okay. On the protection side, in recent years, we have grown our share of the protection
market. We continue to look for opportunities to increase our share of protection market. I
think probably in the numbers you're looking at, our share over recent quarters has been
fairly stable.

And on Suffolk Life and Cofunds, our approach there is to improve the profits by focusing
on operational efficiencies. So, we've gone through – since acquisition of Cofunds, looked
into integration benefits with the rest of Legal & General. In 2015, we've also focused
more on improving the underlying efficiency within the Cofunds business itself and
continue to identify cost savings into there.

Q - Andrew J. Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Could I just come back on that? With a bit more candor, I mean, what has been reported
in the press is that you tried to sell Cofunds because I think there was – I think you said
that there would be about £125 million to £150 million to re-platform it. Can you talk a little
– it looks as though that any disposals or sale process have formed through. Does that
mean we may anticipate a big spend to re-platform?

A - Mike Bury

{BIO 18966535 <GO>}

I'm afraid I can't comment on the speculation that's been in the press.

I think that Mike said n his answer, committees are actually sorting out their kind of day-today process in efficiencies at Cofunds, so you shouldn't be expecting any material shiny

on getting the bread and butter processes sorted out.

Q - Anasuya Iyer

{BIO 18981555 <GO>}

Oh. Hi. Good morning. I have three questions. The first one was just on the bulk annuity
pipeline. And I know you said don't read into Q3, but I just want to understand whether
there's any waiting going on there? Because obviously we're seeing index flows coming
back to positive, but a quieter bulk annuity pipeline. Is the pensioners just waiting for rate
increases and how long is that wait is going to last?
And my second question is just on the reinsurance market and whether – I just want to
understand what stops funds from going directly to reinsurers. And will there, at some

Page 16 of 24



Company N ame: L egal & General Group PL C
Company Ticker: L GEN L N Equity
Date: 2015-11-04

point, be a direct relationship between funds and reinsurers, which risks some of the
longevity business that you do?

FINAL

And the last one was just on LGIM. I think the investor relations team did say that LGIM is
at the top three for UK net retail funds now. And I just want to understand what's driving
that. Is it any one fund and is it sort of a trend that we should pay attention to? Thank you.

A - Mark J. Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

Thanks, Anasuya. Kerrigan, the first two and actually, Mark, pick up on the retail funds and
LGIM.

A - Kerrigan Procter

{BIO 15093363 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Sure. On the question, is there any waiting basically on market movements or rate
increases. I mean, I think really when you reflect on the market, there's probably about, I
don't know, towards to the order of 10% of schemes. It may have been down the LDI
mandate and pretty much fully funded. And there, the most like exclusive or the most
likely account is to head towards the buy-in or buyout route.
And they're fairly obviously unaffected by equity market swings and interest rate swings.
So, not really a waiting point from that point of view. As the ones who are progressing
down that route of de-risking, I'd say almost every pension scheme is somewhere on that
route of de-risking, then, clearly, to get themselves into the position where they can some
contribution from the sponsor for a buy-in or buy-out, then that is somewhat the pension
on equity market moves and it moves in the UK in real interest rates, nominal interest
rates in the U.S.
So, that will have some impact on the following up group (40:13). But there's a wide
dispersion of funds, different stages of the de-risking process with different funded
statuses. So, I don't think any of that really affects the day-to-day or quarter-to-quarter or
year-to-year interest in clients looking to de-risk.
On the reinsurance market, I think that's a really interesting question and something we
think a lot about. Could funds go directly to reinsurers? Well, the answer is in the UK, the
UK pension schemes, the U.S. scheme is no they can't. They have to deal with an insurer.
But it simply is an interesting thing to work out how we can most effectively service our
clients by tapping that reinsurance market. So, if we can be an insurance company instead
of a reinsurance company in the middle that can transform risk straight into the
reinsurance market then I think that's a very interesting proposition for us in that time.

A - Mark J. Zinkula

{BIO 16142450 <GO>}

In regards to the LGIM retail flows, the last couple of years we have strengthened our
distribution and rationalized our product offering in the retail market. And we ranked
currently – I'm not sure where it's at, but 12th, 13th or 14th in AUM in the UK retail market.
So, the second quarter being fifth in net flows and the third quarter third in net flows.
Obviously, we have aspirations to be significantly higher in the lead tables in the retail
space.

FINAL

Most of the demand over the past year, one to two years, has been in our index funds,
our multi-asset funds and our property funds. We have expectations to grow our
presence in fixed income in particular. We have a very strong brand in institutional market,
and we've been punching below our weight into the retail market over the past several
years. And also, with a revised set of equity funds, we're in the process now of building a
track record.
So, we do have aspirations certainly to continue to be a more – a larger presence in the
retail market. We won't be top three again in every quarter, but certainly, I think direction
of travel should be expected to continue.

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi. Good morning, all. Three questions for Kerrigan, please. The first one is on direct
investment. I was just wondering if you could articulate in some way the yield pickup that
you expect to achieve net off some to (43:02) asset charges? So that's the first question.
The second one is on Lifetime Mortgages. How do margins on these mortgages compare
to – or margins and capital requirement compared to retail annuities? And then the last
question is on debt. I think you issued around £600 million of debt during the third
quarter. I was just wondering, was that Solvency II-driven. Thanks.

A - Mark J. Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks, Abid. So, Paul, if you can pick up the word to comment on anything you can
say on the investment yield pickup. And I'll ask Kerrigan on Lifetime Mortgage, anything
you can say on to help the question and I'll pick up the point on the debt issuance.

A - Paul Stanworth

{BIO 15495409 <GO>}

Thank you very much. In terms of direct investments, on the annuity funds themselves,
there's a pickup of probably between 50 and 100 basis points depending on the sectors
that are being invested in. There is an advantage to some of the investments which we
are capturing through combined efforts of investing in a broader range of projects. And
we expect that to be a bigger portion of what we're investing in the future. But the main
bulk of what is playing into the annuity fund is really coming through the LGP direct
investment program.

Company N ame: L egal & General Group PL C

FINAL

Yeah. Yeah. Obviously, I think just adding to Paul's point there is you get a yield pickup for
(44:22) risk premium but also with those assets, you get generally a better security and
better direct control over that security, so any loss-given default we expect to be quite
significantly lower, but certainly the types of investments that we look at. So, lots and lots
of reasons to be interested there.
On the Lifetime Mortgages, margins and cash flow comparable to retail, they're certainly
beneficial assets but it's a different market they come through in terms of profitability and
benefits for us as assets pretty much in the DI camp (44:58).
So, the actual origination and value you see in digital and home finance is not reflective of
the whole value to us which is really Lifetime Mortgage as a diversifier in our asset
portfolio and an asset that yields an attractive spread relative to our back book or traded
credit. So that's where the real benefit comes through. And that is attractive. I mean, we
hopefully – I'm trying to strike the right balance between attractive assets and value for
money for our clients so I think we achieved that. But it's a very interesting and attractive
market to be in.

A - Mark J. Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. And the last question, a bit about your question around our debt issuance and
whether that was Solvency-related category. No, so what we have here is a – and we have
active kind of balance sheet management. And we have a roll-in kind of debt programs.
We got first call dates on subordinate debt going forward in 2017, 2019, 2021. And I know
we're trying to (45:59) just to manage that – the right proportion of debt as part of our
capital funding.
And we're very comfortable with the operating leverage ratio given around 30%, and
that's what we look to try and achieve and maintain over the long term. So we went into
the market this year as part of that longer term agenda, but definitely not a Solvency II
response.

be interesting. But that's separate from the standard formula conversations, of course.

A - Paul Stanworth

{BIO 15495409 <GO>}

Yeah. The only thing I would add to that which is the kind of broader asset base of Legal &
General is the fact that there are a number of indicators that (47:32) given around assetlike strategic equity or SME loans or infrastructure debt where, as Kerrigan said, the main
thing is we are using an internal model. But there are precedents to be set that we can
look at within the standard model.
And that's really important for us for LGC's assets, which themselves are progressively
moving from traded assets into more strategic assets. And we will look to the type of
strategic capital charges that are being used in the standard model when we review our

Yes. Absolutely. (49:09) that.

A - Mark J. Zinkula

{BIO 16142450 <GO>}

Yeah. In regards to LGIM, we can't really quantify I guess that precisely the timing of the
de-risking activity that our clients will have. We'll have a sense with some of the larger
clients, but if you think about how broad and diverse our client base is now and it's
growing in the U.S. obviously there's a combination of – increasing in the U.S. new clients
coming on board. Within the UK, a higher percentage of the activity would be from
existing clients and then we're increasingly winning mandates with smaller clients in some
of our pooled offerings.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, it's – we can't project with that degree of precision. You really have to look more at
the percentage of liabilities that still haven't de-risk, that are unhedged, however you
want to define it. And that's the potential opportunity still for us to take on new business
or transfer business from passive, which is covered in our market and other movement
line item. But the timing of that, it's difficult to project.
In regards to Japan, our recently announced agreement with Meiji Yasuda will focus on
providing global fixed income products for pension clients in the Japanese market. That

Good morning, all. Just three questions from me. I wonder if you can talk generally about

And thirdly, just want to speak up on cost, you've obviously talked about being ahead of
target. Just wonder if that's in terms of the amount or the time scale and whether or not
you could look to revise and increase your cost savings, perhaps, in the likes of – areas like
Cofunds? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Mark J. Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

Okay. I'll pick up the first one and then the third one. Maybe Kerrigan pick up on just the
shape of the (51:38) or maybe Jackie and Mike can comment as well. But just on the UK
pension savings reform, I think it's now (51:46) in the spring budget rather than the
autumn statement. I think that's sensible. Clearly, there's been a lot of people sent back in
to that. Now, we're on record of saying our third option is to have a flat rate that's actually
been outsourced, that we're advocating basically a tax relief for everyone, 20%, but
outsourced and we still want to maintain the exempted tax regime rather than TEE.

Bloomberg Transcript

Clearly, the Treasury will take all that feedback and (52:15) that consider. I think, at the end
of the day, we're pretty (52:19). Overall, we can't guarantee we'll succeed no matter
which way we run and go. We just think, for the sake of the market, in terms of growth in
that market, we think customers will be more reassured to get a tax relief at source rather
than relying on promise of a tax relief, let's say, 50 years' time when they come to retire.
So, it ends up being a pension rather than the current regime, given L&G strength,
particularly with LGIM in the camp. We're very sure we can succeed in that as well, but we
will further see the existing regime maintain where customers now have absolute
confidence that they get the tax relief at (52:50) rather than having to rely on a benign
chance in 50 years' time given that – to honor their promise. So, that's where we are
coming from in that regard.

Thank you.

On the post-retirement savings market, I'm not sure if you want to step (53:02) but happy
to kick off, if you like, I mean, Barrie, you know the figures very, very well, indeed. I think by
numbers of people and some of that 70% post (53:11) have taken cash by pounds, it's
more like the third cash, the third annuities, third drawdown. I think on the annuities front,
we talked about the market remaining subdued. The reasons they have a particular pickup
from that level of annuities than our largest size, there's a bigger further, we're seeing a
standard fixed term and enhanced annuities and those proportions will vary over time, I
think. But yeah, it's like a fairly stabilized flow for annuities now, but much less exciting than
it would have been a couple of years back.
On the drawdown options, well I think we're very excited about the long-term potentials. I
think the market has got a long way to go there yet, but I'm very excited about the LGIM
multi-asset funds, post-retirement funds, and their two and three retirement funds that
they're launching. I think there's a big part for those to play in the future, I think on
drawdown proposition as that market develops.

I think to answer quickly (53:55) post activity, immediately post pension reform date and
kind of where things are settled down. Just a quick comment on this activity a little bit
more generally.

{BIO 17095495 <GO>}

I mean, we've continued to see increased claims volumes through quarter two. And our
new norm in terms of the AU is about 500% to 700% up. Customers are taking continued
stakes for lump sum and small amounts, effectively.

A - Mark J. Gregory

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks, Jackie. Just on kind of wide aspiration for cost, I mean, clearly we are
pleased that our run rate currently is to deliver more than £80 million for the current year.
Barrie, I think in reality – it's always been part of L&G's DNA to kind of make sure we
remain as efficient as possible. I think we (55:00) very clear today that a (54:43) around
Suffolk Life and Cofunds we're going to be very focused on that going forward. But I
mean, it's part of our wider DNA. Cost management will always be a key part of our
agenda. So, it's not just a once-and-gone thing this year. Now, we will always kind of just
make sure we have the right cost base for the organization to make sure that's
appropriate to the earnings growth we want to deliver from here on in.

So, I'm not going to give any revised cost, just simply to say that it will all remain part of
our strategic agenda going forwards.

{BIO 2389115 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

{BIO 15486337 <GO>}

I think, given time is now 10:00. We're probably going to call an end, if you don't mind.
And so, thanks everyone for your inputs and lots of questions. We appreciate that and
we'll speak to you at the year-end.
