Presentation
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Ageas call for analysts and institutional investors. I
am pleased to present Bart De Smet, CEO; and Christophe Boizard, CFO. (Operator
Instructions) Mr. De Smet, your line is open.

Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you, all for dialing into this conference call
and for being with us for the presentation of the full-year 2013 results of Ageas. As usual,
I'm joined in the room by my colleagues of the executive committee; also, Antonio Cano,
the CEO of AG Insurance; our investor relations team; and also, our Head of Legal, Gerry
Bartast[ph].
Before commenting on the press release for the 2013 full-year results, I would like to
draw the attention to another separate press release that we issued this morning. You

might have seen that our colleague member of the executive committee, Kurt De
Schepper, our Chief Risk Officer, has expressed a wish to retire as per July 1 this year.

FINAL

I, first of all, would like to thank Kurt on behalf of Ageas and the entire management team
for his contribution, and also for his capacity to keep us from time to time with the feet on
the ground.
Secondly, to ensure a smooth transition, we have already announced that Filip Coremans,
the current CFO and CRO for our Asian segment, will replace him. I'm convinced that
Filip's more than 10-year experience in the Group, and especially his view of important
segment like Asia, will be instrumental for the further steps the Company has to make in
the coming years.
Ladies and gentlemen. the 2013 insurance result posted this morning after the second
year in a row solid, with the Fourth Quarter confirming the positive trend of the previous
quarters, taking into account of course some inevitable seasonable elements.

Bloomberg Transcript

Further progress has been made in the course of the year against our strategic and
financial objectives, and we took additional steps in reducing the complexity of the Group.
These evolutions contributed positively to the Board's decision to increase the proposed
dividend over 2013 by 70% compared to the previous year to an amount of EUR1.4 per
share.
I also would like to stress a significant recent positive development in our legacy litigation.
Last Friday, the Dutch Trade and Industry Appeal Tribunal announced the fine the Dutch
Financial Market Supervisory Authority had imposed on Fortis in 2010 for alleged
miscommunication on its subprime exposure in September 2007. Considering that Fortis
had at the time not acted unreasonably, the Appeal Tribunal closed the case in a final way,
while ruling in favor of Fortis on an important part of its legacy litigation.
On slide two of the pack, you will find the main headlines of the 2013 results. I'll go
through these briefly, and later on, Christophe will comment in more detail.
The net insurance profit in 2013 amounted to EUR654 million, up 5% compared to 2012,
with a net result in the Fourth Quarter of EUR157 million. In 2012, the Fourth Quarter net
result amounted to EUR175 million.
Group inflows, including the non-consolidated parternships at 100%, amounted to
EUR23.2 billion, which is 9% up on last year, with a Fourth Quarter of EUR5.5 billion.
Life inflows were up 11%, thanks to the good sales in Asia and Continental Europe. In nonlife, the growth was somewhat more modest at 3%, with higher inflows in all segments.
Outperformance this year, where again, the Asian businesses with total sales up 25%, but
also Continental Europe up 21%, mainly driven by very good sales in Portugal.

FINAL

Compared to 2012, the combined ratio with the consolidated activities improved to
98.6%, benefiting especially from good results in household. It is worth noting here that
this figure includes some negative impact in Belgium from governmental measures, and
from the storms and floods that hit Belgium and the UK in the Fourth Quarter.
The Group net profit amounted to EUR570 million, with a net loss in general account of
EUR85 million. The general account reported a net loss in the Fourth Quarter of EUR100
million. As in 2012, this net result included the impact of the financial legacies, which
explains the volatility year on year.
As you know, in the early part of 2013, we had a positive impact of transactions with
respect to Royal Park Investments, and the settlement of a call option on the BNP Paribas
shares. But in the second part of the year, the change valuation methodology for RPN(i),
and substantial increase of the price of the CASHES financial instrument, caused an
important negative non-cash charge. Christophe will come back on this.
With respect to the evolution of the shareholders' equity and solvency, the shareholders'
equity declined to EUR8.5 billion, or EUR37.65 per share, and partly explained by lower
unrealized gains. Other factors impacting this full-year drop are the total amount returned
to shareholders in 2013, and the higher estimated fair value of the liability related to the
put option linked to 25%+1 share of AG Insurance.

Bloomberg Transcript

The solvency of our insurance operations increased slightly compared to the end of 2012
to 207%, while the Group solvency came down to 214% at the end of 2013.
The net cash position increased substantially in 2013 to EUR1.9 billion, befitting, among
others, from the proceeds related to RPI and the call option on the BNP Paribas shares,
but also from an extra focus on cash upstreaming from our various operating companies.
Ladies and gentlemen. before handing over to Christophe to comment in more detail on
the performance on the respective business segments, I'd like to go back to the plan we
outlined at the investors' update in September.
You will remember that I shared with you a more detailed list of actions designed to
improve denominated and denominator respectively of the return on equity. They have
been recapped on slide three of the presentation.
In terms of our actions to improve the numerator, you can see on slide four that the
operating margin on our guaranteed life products at 96 basis points is well ahead of our
objective. The same is true for the combined ratio in non-life; our plan to move to a higher
proportion of unit-linked products; and, last but not least, an increased contribution from
our non-consolidated partnerships.
The second line of action relates to the denominator, and here, we have promised that
we would optimize the leverage levels of our operating companies. And in this regard,

Page 3 of 29



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2014-02-19

you will have seen that we successfully increased the leverage in our insurance operating
companies, more specifically in Belgium.

FINAL

Secondly, and as previously mentioned, we upstreamed more than EUR600 million of
cash, with all segments contributing towards this. On slide 6, you can find more details;
and also, in the press release on page 17, you will find a detailed table we plan in the
future to publish once a year.
All these actions illustrate and underscore our determination to use our capital more
efficiently and to optimize it where possible.
If we turn now to where we stand with respect to the realization of the vision 2015
targets, slide seven of the presentation, we can say that most of the progress has been
made with respect to the combined ratio target, mainly because of the better combined
ratio in the UK.
With respect to return on equity, we see a decrease from 8.7% to 8.3%, and this is more
the result of a mathematical evolution rather than underlying business evolution.

Bloomberg Transcript

The net profit increased in 2013 with 5%, but the average shareholders' equity went up
with 11% due to the higher average unrealized gains in 2013 than in 2012. Including
unrealized gains, the return on equity amounted to 10.4%
Ladies and gentlemen. the allocation of our net cash is a strategic choice of which we
have clearly said that in the current environment we emphasize two options; to reinvest in
the business or return to shareholders.
With respect to reinvestment in the business, I want to reemphasize what we said in
September. Discipline is key. Every M&A transaction has to reflect the strict criteria we
have set out. The alternative option of returning cash to shareholders has been
implemented in various ways in 2013.
First of all, I'm on slide 9, there is a decision to increase the dividend up to EUR1.40 per
share, or a total estimated amount of some EUR310 million to be paid out. This proposed
dividend corresponds to the payout ratio at the high end of the 40% to 50% payout
target, and a dividend yield of 4.5%.
Moreover, as you know, we have returned some EUR220 million to shareholders last
December via the announced capital reduction; and meanwhile, we have executed about
half of the EUR200 million share buyback program launched last August.
On slide 10, you can see that our share in terms of total shareholder return substantially
outperformed the financial markets on a five-year, a three-year and a one-year base.

Ladies and gentlemen. this is the end of my introduction. I now want to hand over to
Christophe. Christophe, the floor is yours.

Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Thank you, Bart. So to complement Bart's presentation, I will provide you as usual with
more details on the operating performance of our insurance activity, then some additional
elements of the general account, and the evolution of our investment portfolio and our
solvency position.
First, our insurance operations, and I am on slide 11. First, and before starting the
explanation, I hope you will appreciate the new layout of the slides with the full year and
the quarter in the same boxes. So you have kind of overall view of all the different KPI
segment by segment with the two visions.
So on slide 11, our insurance operations reported a net profit of EUR654 million, up EUR30
million, despite the negative currency impact of EUR12 million compared to 2012. Overall,
results evolved well in all segments, except for the UK, where we were all in all pleased to
secure the result, even though it was last year slightly below the one of last year. The Q4
result of EUR157 million was lower than last year mainly due to lower realized net capital
gains.

Bloomberg Transcript

The EUR438 million contribution of the life activity was slightly higher than in 2012. The
combined non-life and other activities contributed EUR217 million. Bart already talked
about the combined ratio and the operating margins on our guaranteed life products.
On the unit-linked products, the operating margin came down to 28 bps. This drop is
entirely due to a non-recurring negative result in Hong Kong. Belgium and Continental
Europe stayed well above 40 bps for the full year.
Moving on to the Belgian operations, we are on slide 12 now, I'd like to start with the net
profit which increased to EUR335 million. The life net result increased to EUR274 million,
benefiting from a lower effective tax rate.
The non-life net result came down slightly to EUR61 million, with a lower operating result
across all major business lines.
New government measures, more specifically the introduction of VAT on lawyer fees as
of January 1, 2014, had a negative impact, while household suffered from an adverse
claims evolution.
The prior year reserve release came down from 4.5% to 3.6%.
In flow now; the total inflow declined by 14%. As in the previous quarters, life suffered
from substantially lower volumes in guaranteed life products, only partly offset by higher

Page 5 of 29

Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2014-02-19

FINAL

sales in unit-linked products. The continued low interest rate, an increase of the insurance
taxes, and the very high partly anticipated sales level in 2012, are the main explanations.
The headlines for our UK segment are on slide 13. The net result of EUR100 million
compares to EUR108 million in 2012, and includes an adverse foreign currency impact of
EUR5 million. Remember that 2012 benefited from EUR4 million positive non-recurring
impact linked, among others, to the purchase gap on Groupama UK. The retail activities
did suffer from sharp competition and result in life is lower, but these are small numbers.
All this could not entirely be offset by the good underwriting discipline and the solid
contribution from the acquired Groupama in non-life.
Total inflows in the UK increased slightly to EUR2.3 billion, a figure which includes almost
EUR400 million of inflow coming from Groupama UK.
In motor, the average premium according to market research came down by 10[ph] to
14% roughly. Ageas did not follow these market discounts and chose to maintain
underwriting discipline. On the top of this, Tesco Underwriting chose to focus on its core
club card customers with a view to narrowing its client base and improving its risk profile.

Bloomberg Transcript

The overall combined ratio came down to 98.4%, with a prior-year reserve release of
3.3% compared to the 2.1% we had in 2012.
On slide 14 of the presentation, the Continental Europe net result amounted to EUR77
million, up EUR13 million on last year, with an adverse foreign currency impact of EUR2
million. But as I mentioned it for UK, I also mention it for Continental Europe even though
it's a small number.
EUR9 million relates to the sale of real estate in Turkey in the first half of the year, but this
was already reported in previous closing. Aside from this, the non-life result improved
significantly, again entirely driven by the excellent underwriting result in Turkey.
The net life result came down to EUR44 million with a lower contribution from Portugal,
where the 2012 life risk claims ratio was exceptionally low.
As already mentioned by Bart, total inflows were up 21%, with growth coming mostly from
the life activities. For the first time ever, Continental Europe life topped the EUR4 billion
mark, with higher inflows in all countries.
The evolution in Portugal was the most striking. Good sales both in unit-linked and savings,
and total inflow almost double to EUR1.5 billion.
Non-life inflows increased by 4% to EUR1.1 billion. Turkey grew strongly, once again on
household and motor, and ended up just above EUR600 million.

FINAL

Lastly Asia, on slide 15. Excellent results again, with an 11% increase in net profit to EUR142
million, and a good result in the Fourth Quarter. The improvement came essentially from
an increase in non-life to reach EUR21 million.
The 2012 results were impacted by the 2011 floods in Thailand, while 2013 was marked by
a much better underwriting performance and a better investment result. The life result
stayed almost flat at EUR122 million. The underlying performance improved, except for
China, which was impacted by significant investments in sales campaign and channel
development.
By way of illustration, we have in the meantime more than 100,000 agents working for
Taiping Life now. Of course, the inflow, the 100%, the inflow evolution attracted the most
of attention increasing to nearly EUR10 billion. This represents more than 40% of total
inflow at the AGS level.
Most of this increase came from China and was driven by the very successful single
premium sales campaigns in the First Quarter. In addition, it is also worth highlighting that
Thailand was up 20% on the previous year.

Bloomberg Transcript

On slide 16, you can find the traditional overview of the investment portfolio. The slight
decrease in total value to EUR75.1 billion is mainly attributable to lower unrealized gain on
fixed income; and secondly, but that I mentioned -- I already mentioned that at the last
closing the fact that we cancelled the on[ph] lending structure with BNP Paribas with a
direct consequence of a reduction in the loan segment of something like EUR750 million.
It was the NITSH I and II, if you remember.
The most important increase can be found in equities going up to EUR3.2 billion, and
related both to higher unrealized gain and to additional investments made in 2013.
Ladies and gentlemen. this brings me to the general account, and we are on slide 17 now.
So we already mentioned a net loss of EUR85 million for the full year with a net result of
minus EUR100 million in the Fourth Quarter. On the one hand, you have the real staff and
operating expenses which came down to EUR45 million. The rest of the net result is
explained by the combined financial impact of the various legacies.
The transactions conclude in early April with respect to the sale of the Royal Park
Investments portfolio and the simultaneous sale of the BNP Paribas call option resulted in
a combined net financial positive impact on the result of EUR185 million.
Then the RPN(i), the last -- the financial legacy, we had the review of the valuation
methodology of the RPN(i) liability in the Third Quarter following the introduction of IFRS
13. This was explained at length during the Investor Day. And we have a substantial
increase of the price of the CASHES financial instrument. So these are the two elements
to explain why the RPN(i) increased so much.

Page 7 of 29



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V

Date: 2014-02-19

FINAL

In total, this led to an adjustment of EUR205 million negative, of which EUR91 million in the
Fourth Quarter. This is for the RPN(i) adjustment. At the end of 2013, the RPN(i) liability is
accounted in our books at EUR370 million.
The net cash position increased in the course of the year from EUR1.2 billion to EUR1.9
billion. Also here, the settlement with respect to RPI and the call option was key too for
that increase. Bart already referred to the new table in our press release providing you
with all the details regarding the upstream of dividend from the operating companies, but
also all the other movements that impact the net cash position. So you have really a very
detailed view of what happened on the cash position.
On slide 18, you can see the shareholders' equity decline to EUR8.5 billion, or EUR37.65
per share. The factors impacting the full-year drop are the lower unrealized gains due to
the interest rate rises, the total amount returned to the shareholder in 2013, and the
higher estimated fair value of the liability related to the put option linked to the 25%+1
share of AG insurance not compensated by the write-down of the corresponding noncontrolling interest.

Bloomberg Transcript

On slide 19, you will find the updated solvency figures at the insurance level and at Group
level. The solvency of the insurance operations came down from 210% at the end of
September to 207% at the end of the year. But you will remember that this year, we only
deducted the planned dividend upstream from our Belgian operation in the Fourth
Quarter, so one shot, and not proportionately throughout the year as we did before.
At Group level, the solvency came down from EUR229 million at the end of 2012 to 214%.
The main reason for the decrease lies in the increased value of the liability related to the
put option on the AG insurance shares, the capital injection in China and, of course, the
share buyback program.
Ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to end my comments here and to hand over to Frank.

Questions And Answers
A - Frank Vandenborre

{BIO 15168443 <GO>}

Thank you, Christophe. This opens the floor for questions. As quite some people on the
phone, I would ask to limit yourself to two questions, and if you would have more
questions, go back in the row; and obviously after the call, we can also help you.
Operator?

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

FINAL

So a couple of questions, one on Chinese capital injection. You have injected EUR200
million capital in China in 2013. Can you give us an outlook on that; i.e., are you planning to
inject more capital, or are you looking to --? What are your plans for Chinese operations?
Because it looks like it's highly capital consumptive now because of the growth plans that
Taiping Life has.
So that's the first thing.
Secondly, the -- currently there are no thoughts on M&A. There is nothing in the pipeline,
or there may be something in the pipeline. Can you give us some color on what's there in
the pipeline; i.e., if there is no M&A when should we expect more cash return to the
shareholders because of maybe potential no M&A?
So these are the two questions. Thank you.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Maybe on the first question, I think the capital increase is close to EUR200 million, and
with two tranches, the first one beginning of the year, around EUR70 million, and then the
rest at the end of the year.
But we have explosive growth there, really explosive growth, so it's a way to go along
with the -- with increase -- the increasing volume of the China operation. We are really in
the growing phase.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Yes. But how much more capital do you plan to put in because of the growth? Is it --? Will
it continue to be capital consumptive like what we have seen in 2013, or do you expect it
to go down; I mean, it won't be needing more capital going forward?

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

First, we have to be careful on this, and this will depend on the activity in 2014. But there is
not such amount for 2014, so we will -- nothing is forecast for 2014 at this moment.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

And the second question on M&A, we stay -- what I also said with our position expressed
the end of September that we look around; we to look to files that fit in our strategy. And
maybe to remind, first of all look in[ph] markets where we are present in Europe; we look
to -- give preference for non-life. But we each time will do it while respecting our strategic
and financial objectives.

FINAL

In Asia, we mentioned that it's not excluded that we enter new markets but that we will in
any case not be asking for big tickets. So I think we have also shown in the past years not
to -- will want to spend money in M&A at any price so we keep disciplined.
We'll see. And whether we will do something else with the cash, that we might[ph]. What
has been said on the return to shareholders last year of close to EUR700 million, we are
still currently halfway our buyback program launched in August. We pay a dividend. This is
higher growth than our net profit, but it's in the 40/50[ph] range, so we will -- what we did
in the past years is as going forward.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

Okay. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

I have two questions. First, the operating margin in life is very high in Q4. Can you give a
bit more details on why this is? And basically, what outlook can you give for 2014? Your
official guidance is for 85 basis points to 90 basis points. We've been above this number,
both in 2012 and 2013. So is there room to increase the target, or do you expect
headwinds in the coming months?
And the second question is on Hong Kong. There's been a one-off. I wondered you could
give a bit more details on that.
Thank you.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

For the operating margin in life, I think we tried to be extremely transparent by giving it on
a quarterly base, but of course knowing that some elements like, for instance, the
frequency and the amounts of the capital gains that are realized, and more precisely on
real estate, are not always spread equally over the year. So you can have sometimes
swings from one quarter to another.
I think most important is that we first of all committed to this range of 85 to 90 basis
points; that we of course will do everything to stay in that range, and where possible to
exceed it, with at the same time keeping a total offer to our clients that is attractive. And I
think that is the solution that we also found for last year is a margin that was okay and
even above the targeted range, and nevertheless a total return to our policyholders that
is appreciated, and that is also I would say a good starting base for the coming years.

A - Christophe Boizard

Page 10 of 29



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V

So we have to be careful in interpreting the margin on a quarterly basis only. It's better to
have long-term view over the different quarters. Otherwise we are, as you said, impacted
by one-off like realizing capital gains. And, for instance, we made some capital gain in real
estate at the end of the year, and this impact the margin as well.

FINAL

Q - Francois Boissin

{BIO 16045021 <GO>}

Okay. And is there --? I understand that there's been higher capital gains. Has there been
a reduction in the crediting rates that[ph] you actually paid out to policyholders this year?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

I talk[ph] on the control[ph] of Antonio. I think we've gone to something which is in line
with last year, so it means that it's around 3% total return for the policyholders. So it
means that in the positioning in Belgium market, we are as always not top, but we are in
the top quartile with return to policyholders.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Then you mentioned Hong Kong, and you are right. We have high figures on Hong Kong.
But there is -- there was a one-off not related to market conditions, capital gains, or things
of that kind. It was more, let's say, a methodological adjustment. And we have to read the
margin together with the one on unit-linked where we have the opposite effect. And we
have the big plus on guaranteed minus on the unit-linked, so it's still a little bit work in
progress on Hong Kong as far as the margins are concerned. And so more a
methodological effect, first element; second, to be read together with the unit-linked
result, which is much lower.

Q - Francois Boissin

{BIO 16045021 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you, very much.

Q - Albert Ploegh

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

A few questions from my side, first one on the dividend, which was ahead of consensus;
but in a way, it's still within your payout range of 40% to 50% while actually being
upstreaming more capital to the holding than required for funding the dividends and the
holding expenses. So what made you still decide not to go, let's say, to the full 50% or
even a higher payout range?
That's my first question.
The second question's a bit of a follow-up on an earlier question. You mentioned that if
there are no opportunities for M&A, you would return more to shareholders. I understand
that looking at files clearly takes time and your messaging is clear. But is there any
likelihood that something might be decided, i.e., returning in the second half of this year?

Or should we really see this more as a 2015 event given also your business plan
presentation last September?

FINAL

And my final question is on the Belgium life back book. Can you give some insight in the
current running yields versus guarantees, and also if possible on the new business
production?
Thank you.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Question one, dividend. As you indicate clearly, Albert, it is indeed within our policy, 40%
to 50%. It's exactly 47%. Theoretically, we could have gone to EUR1.46[ph] or EUR1.47[ph],
but I think we in the first place want to be within the range and then you have -- you take
somewhere decision.

Bloomberg Transcript

We also, and it's not -- it's also easier to communicate somewhere around the figures that
can also be easily calculated by people having to pay withholding back tax of 25%. And we
also, I think, without having said that this is a clear commitment, we have the commitment
of paying between 40% and 50%, but we, of course, also try to have a positive trend
towards the future in our dividend payment unless the results would be completely -The second question was on the cash, I think. When we announced the priorities saying
we want to use this cash for M&A, and if not, we'll give it back to shareholders, we of
course did not take a focus of three months to make the one or the other decision. So
that is something you should see as we also on the line, I believe, being a continuous
assessment going forward, like we did in the past.
So I cannot at this moment give any indication whether we will do something different in
2014 or 2015. It depends on market opportunities; depends on maybe external effect that

On the investment yields, so I have figures. On the bond, the fixed income bond, fixed
income excluding market June[ph], on new money, we are at 3.29%. And you will
remember that the minimum guaranteed rate for the main products are at 1.5%. And on
the existing book is 3.49%[ph]. So it means -- but my comment that it is becoming closer
and closer and we don't have a big difference now between the investment yield on
existing book and what we obtain from new money. And the 3.29% and 3.49%, only 20
bps of difference.

Q - Albert Ploegh

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

Right. Thank you. Maybe one follow-up on the new guarantee of 1.5%. It seems there are
at least some places in the Belgian market have been becoming a little bit more active in
the latter part of last year. Has it been a more, let's say, one-off campaign, or is it a bit
more structural trend that there might be some pressure on the one-offs[ph] and
guaranteed level?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

There has been one or another campaign, but we stick to the 1.5% as most of the players
do. And I think if you look to the evolution of the life inflow and the market share, although
Ageas Insurance stayed at the lower end in guarantee, it gained market share.
As for the drop in income, that is 20% in life, is lower than the drop in life inflow in the
Belgian market. That's more in the area of 25%.

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

Two questions as well, please, first, with regard to the dividends to the holding. Can you
provide the exact amount excluding those distributions related to offset the fresh
injection in the hybrid debt redemption, please?
And looking forward, what would be a reasonable remittance ratio for 2014? If I
remember correctly, you were guiding historically for 50% of earnings of the units to be
paid out to the holding, but your solvency is quite strong at the insurance level. So might
there be upside to that level?
And then secondly on the combined ratio in Q4, could you quantify the impact of floods
and storms which might be considered exceptional? And looking forward to Q1 what could
be the impact of the UK floods and storms we've seen so far, please?

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

I can take the first question on the dividend. So you have already some explanation in the
press release, in the press release regarding the total amount of dividend. Then we did
one operation of leverage on AG only in 2013, and on slide six of the presentation, you

Page 13 of 29



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V

have the breakdown. So it means that EUR225 million are related to this, let's say, capital
optimization. So you have total figures in the press release, of which is EUR225 million.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

FINAL

(Multiple speakers). The core regular[ph] dividend is something like EUR410 million.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Matthias De Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

And how should we think about this ratio going forward in 2014?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

I would say that as you know that their solvency ratios are in most regions in line or better
than our target of 200% that we plan to have to continue with the methodology[ph]
where we have seen dividend is such that the dividend we want to pay to shareholders
plus regional and headquarter costs are covered. So we

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

And we have -- we can say that we have the rising trend in incoming dividend, and I would
take as a good example ICA to obtain the dividend for the first time this year in
December. And what is foreseen is to increase the amount paid by ICA, and this is one
example. But the trend is to increase incoming dividend to the holding.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

And you also seeing on page 17 of the press release that almost all entities pay dividends.
The only exception is one we already talked about is China where we have, of course, this
quite important growth.
And your last question, expected impact from the storms in Q1. Of course, it's a bit
difficult to be very, very precise, certainly in the UK, because it may be -- the UK is used to
have storms and floodings, but this time, as water stands longer at higher levels, the
ultimate impact is more -- is also more on estimation than on real experience.
What we see today, Belgium, and you could say something like EUR5 million impact; and
UK, something like EUR20 million. And this is more net[ph] but before reinsurance. And
also remind that also in previous years in Q1, we had impact from weather-related events.
It was not storms last year but more a very tough winter.
So this is just to give you an idea about the amounts we estimate today as being the net
impact of specifically these storms, without taking into account maybe better results in
other areas of the non-life business.

Q - Maarten Altena

{BIO 15898902 <GO>}

Two questions from my side. The first is on Asia, because I wonder how sustainable this
other[ph] Fourth Quarter result is stemming from Asia. So is this the result of the earlier
efforts that now start to pay off, or is it just to the earlier mentioned one-offs you
discussed before?
And maybe also given the fluctuations in FX, could you update us on your hedging
strategy? So have you hedged any of your non-euro FX cash flows or profits? And maybe
to clarify the numbers you just mentioned on the UK storm and Belgium; is that for the
First Quarter 2014, or also including the further quarter 2013 impact?
Thanks.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Starting with the last question, this is First Quarter 2014.

Q - Maarten Altena

{BIO 15898902 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Going back to the first, and Christophe will take the second one, so what we have told
last year is in China, for instance, we had quite huge growth, certainly in the first part of
the year, and we take up all costs in P&L so it's not spread over time.
In the second half of the year, there was a bit more flattening, more regular premium than
single premium, which is one of our, let's say objectives in China, which means that you
have a kind of a recovery of the results also in China.
So we of course, as mentioned at the Investor Day last year, we expect that the net result
contribution from what we call the emerging markets, so it means Asia, excluding Hong
Kong, plus Turkey, we have further increase, and we will bond[ph] one of the elements to
help us achieve this 11% return on equity.
So it's certainly not that we see the results of 2014 for Asia, or the Q4 result as a fully
exceptional result. We are quite confident that's a good indicator for the future.

Q - Farquhar Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Just two questions, if I may. Firstly, just coming back to the UK floods, could you just give
us an indication of what the reinsurance arrangements are around UK flooding? And in
particular, I'm trying to get a sense of what the maximum loss could be there.

Bloomberg Transcript

And actually, as a point of clarification, you seemed to say that EUR20 million was net but
before reinsurance. Are you saying it's net of tax but gross of insurance?
And then secondly on prior year, it was about 5.4percentage points in the final quarter,
which seems a bit high; but equally, the average figure for the full year was 3.5percentage
points, which is actually pretty normal for the last couple of years. I'm just trying to get a
sense of why there was such a large contribution in the final quarter, and more generally
actually, whether the annual figure of 3.5percentage points is actually can be sustained
going forward.
Thanks.

A - Unidentified Speaker
Okay. On the reinsurance. As you see in our annual results publication, we give the detail
on the UK cutback[ph] program. We are in the order of magnitude of EUR40 million, which
means EUR50 million. That of course is gross. There is a small difference between
Tesco[ph], a much smaller entity where the retention is of course much, much lower, and
in major entity, which is AIL. So any amount, provided that it is of course considered one
event under the reinsurance treaty, about EUR50 million[ph] would go to the reinsurer.
Now that one event, you have to look at details, but it's measured in our policy over a 21year period.
As to the prior-year run off, Bart, would you take that one?

FINAL

Well, I'll start and you can complete. So you indicated[ph] a higher effect, positive effect in
Q4, but nevertheless, it's a balance there between, for instance, some strengthening of
reserves in maybe[ph] Belgium and some higher releases than the previous quarters in
the UK.
In any case, what we do is a quite, let's say, precise estimation of our reserves. We have,
of course, all internal but also external control on that by our actuaries and our external
auditors. And if you look to the overall release we have had in the past years, and I take
the full year, so it was 3.5% this year, it was 3.4% the year before, 3.5% in 2011, 3.7% in
2010, so it's a quite normal year, and we don't see any reason why it should go up or
down in the coming period.

Operator
And we still have three questions in queue. (Operator Instructions) William Elderkin,
Goldman Sachs.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - William Elderkin

{BIO 3349136 <GO>}

Just two quick follow-ups really. First of all, just on focus points on the UK flood losses, is
that EUR20 million effect you mentioned, is that EUR20 million post-tax but before any
reinsurance effect?
And then the second question is could you just give your view of where you think UK
motor insurance pricing is going from here, obviously, having looked at this downward
movements over the last year or so.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. First question is affirmative that the EUR20 million is post-tax and before
reinsurance. The second, what we have seen and there are some different figures, it's
that the rates came down on average in UK between 9% and 14% depending on the
source. We've seen in our portfolio that it is also something like 8%.
What is generally expected is that maybe earlier than foreseen, there will be a change
again more upwards. Some reasons; first of all is that it has been made clear that the
expected benefits from the ban on referral fees is expected to be lower than what was
initially thought by the industry. It means that the rate decreases have been maybe a bit
too optimistic.
And the second is, and that's more of a psychological one, that apparently what is
happening today with the floodings is also making the public more acceptable for
stabilizing or increasing rates in motor.
Page 17 of 29



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2014-02-19

So we personally believe that there will be increased discipline in the market, first of all
due to the overall evolution of claims, which is not necessarily motor, in this case
household; and secondly, because a more closed view on the effects of the referral ban.

FINAL

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

But what we can say is that it is likely that the so-called payback mechanism will take place
on the reinsurance side because they will suffer from substantial losses. So it is expected
that they will raise the rates for the next renewal, and this should drive the prices up.
That's the normal movement of the industry.

Two questions from my side. First of all, sorry to come back to this, but I wanted to have
your outlook for the life insurance volumes in Belgium for next year. I think 2013 has been
a difficult year, but now the increase in insurance tax has been absorbed, so how do you
see the market going forward?
And my second question is on the RPN(i). I believe you had an agreement, a
compensation agreement, with BNP that lasted for two years should they decide to
tender the remaining instruments. This was until January 2014. Have you had any talks with
them on tendering the remaining CASHES? And if yes, what's their position on this?
Thank you.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

So first question, I think you already give part of the answer in your question is that,
indeed, the impact of the increased taxes have been absorbed by the public. So what we
expect is, and we talk of course for our own, is that volumes in life in Belgium will not be
lower than 2013.
The fact that we can also show that we have a solid policy in terms of profit sharing will
certainly help. So we don't expect a further drop of the volumes, and we see positive
evolution towards more appetizing unit-linked.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Then your second question was on the agreement with BNP Paribas on the RPN(i). So you
are right that we are close to the end. Actually, it was not end of January; it was more end
of February. But it doesn't change things much.
Page 18 of 29



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2014-02-19

The agreement was in case the prices of the CASHES become attractive, which is not at
all the case, so it means that we are very far from doing anything with the CASHES right
now. And the agreement will expire and we have no further agreement in place after this.
So we leave things as they are.

FINAL

Q - Tom Van Kempen

{BIO 17194522 <GO>}

Okay. Just a follow-up then, if you don't mind. Is there any way for you to get rid of the
RPN(i) then, of the obligations related to that, or is it only dependent on BNP?

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

If there was a solution, the solution has to be found with BNP Paribas, obviously, we are
co-obligor[ph] on the CASHES, and we are linked with this RPN(i) asset on their side,
liability on our side, So this has to be done together. But there is no need on either side to
do something.
For us, it's like a liability with a very low cost. We pay Paribas plus 90[ph]. So for us, the
best thing is to leave the RPN(i) as it is, even though I have to admit that this volatility
induced in the general account doesn't help. But there is no cash component here, and
we have to accept with shareholder equity plus RPN(i) is constant at the end.

Bloomberg Transcript

So if you consider -- but it's a little bit stretched, but if you consider that RPN(i) is
permanent funding, we consider shareholder equity plus RPN(i) is constant. So that's the
way we look at it. At the end, we don't see any appeal to do a costly operation to unwind
this. So as I said, we leave things as they are.

Just a couple of things. One is your expense ratio has much improved in the Fourth
Quarter, and notably in the UK we saw a drop. I just want to have an idea what's your
outlook for next year. That means should we use that as a guidance? That means do you
find that the higher expense ratio that came with the Groupama acquisition is now starting
to go downwards?
The second thing is on the dividends in China. I think it's great to have the disclosure. But
on China, as you mentioned it, for the moment, they are not appearing on the score
sheet. Do you think that it's something that we could expect still, for example, in 2015? Or
do you think that it could take a number of years to see dividends from China with the
current situation?

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

FINAL

On China, on the dividends, that's our view, but it can be challenged. But we think that
Taiping will be more and more under the pressure of financial analysts. They are listed in
Hong Kong. Which means that they will be obliged to have, let's say, some discipline vis-avis the dividend. And we are lucky enough to be at the operating level.
So it means that one day they will be obliged to upstream dividend with higher payout
ratio. And we think that at this moment we will benefit from a dividend. So this will come,
but I don't know when. But this will come thanks to the fact that they are becoming more
and more under the pressure of the external world, and they have -- as the analysts
report, they have a lot of things.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

The first question, indeed, we can say that it's also in the press release that the
integration of Groupama in the UK activities has been almost completed. We are more
than pleased with the results that exceed our expectations.
And for the expense ratio, it's a combination of cost ratio and commissions. Commissions
of the Groupama portfolio were on average higher than on our AIL portfolio because it's
also a different product mix. So I would say that we certainly not expect the expense ratio
to go up in the coming period.

lower than year before for the guaranteed part specifically. Yes.

FINAL

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

The only region we see is -- in the investment margin, you can have, as mentioned
before, differences in capital gains, sometimes a real estate transaction that's done in Q3
in one year and Q4 in the other year. If I talk a bit top of memory, I think we have
something like EUR7 million difference i -- that's AGS-wide in Q4, less capital gains than
the year before.
Antonio, do you see another explanation?

A - Antonio Cano

{BIO 16483724 <GO>}

No. Apart from seasonality and capital gains, there is no other real difference. It's pretty
stable.

Q - David Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Sorry. I was just -- under the guaranteed for nine months, you have EUR11.6 million, and for
the full year you have EUR4.3 million for the net underlying[ph] result so I was just
wondering --

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

That should be -- that won't be Belgium (multiple speakers).

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

This has to be investigated, but sometimes, we have the annual movement in the profit
sharing which takes place in Q4, etc. So we can have -- it's the reason why at the
beginning we said that the interpretation of margin based on quarter alone can be difficult
to combine[ph].

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

I'll try to find back the figures because it was EUR95 million[ph] --

A - Antonio Cano

{BIO 16483724 <GO>}

The net underwriting result is to a large extent driven by the volumes we make, because
the cost loading included in the premiums is part of the positive in the underwriting

Two follow-up questions, please. First one is on litigation. Can you expand a little bit on
the positive development from the AFM and what the implications would be for basically
all the lawsuits going forward?
And the second question is you report EUR0.3 billion available capital in general accounts.
I just wondered how you get to this number, because it's significantly below the cash
position.
Thank you.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Christophe will take together with Thierry[ph] maybe the first one.

A - Unidentified Speaker
On the litigation, the short answer would be if we would only know what the
consequences are we would be happy. But seriously, we have said since the beginning
that we would do our utmost best to defend the interests of the Company, as this being
Page 23 of 29



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V

our duty towards the current shareholders, however traumatic the events of 2008 may
have been.

FINAL

In this light, indeed the decision by the Dutch court, which is final and irreversible, to
cancel the AFM finally[ph] related to the communication around the (CDO) exposure is for
us pretty welcomed. It basically says that, and in an irrevocable way, that the
communication did not require any administrative[ph] sanction.
If you read the judge's -- the judgment, they say, actually AFM did not adequately
demonstrate that there was any bi-sensitive[ph] information withheld. They say the risk
judgment at that time by Fortis was not unreasonable. And I think this is the most
important thing, because it really puts everything again in the right context. Things have to
be judged in the context at that time.
They also refer to the fact that with the information at that time, the Belgian regulator had
approved the trading update. And this of course is going to be positive in our ongoing
litigation, but it definitely does not signal unfortunately the end of that and we will see
how things evolve moving forward.
I hope this adequately replies to your question.
On the second one, Christophe, will you take that?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Yes. So you are right. There is a big drop in the capital position to EUR0.3 billion under the
general account. You are right. We started the year at EUR1 billion, so there is a big drop,
and the reasons are the following.
You have a lot of reasons among which you have the result at the general account level,
mainly driven by the revaluation of the RPN(i) and that's a drain on this.
You have the put option. The put option on the BNP Paribas shares alone, it's EUR258
million. And you have other things like the capital injection in China; that's a minus, minus
EUR200 million[ph]. You have part of the elements shown in the roll forward in the
shareholder equity. It's the general account, like the purchase of own shares, for instance.
So all these elements added up makes -- explain the drop.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

And so the difference between this EUR300 million and the almost, let's say, EUR2 billion
net cash is that in our accounting, it is assumed that we have to put the cash aside for the
RPN(i) and for the put option. And together they make something like EUR1.6 billion/EUR1.7
billion.

When you read that together with EUR300 billion[ph], you have, let's say, an equal
amount capital plus these liabilities with the cash.

FINAL

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

No. You are right. When you read the balance sheet, it is true; but on the liabilities side,
you have this RPN(i) and the put option, and on the asset side the cash. So you may argue
that the cash is not free, but our view is slightly different in the sense that the RPN(i) is a
non-cash element, so we will have -- we will never have to pay for the RPN(i).
And on the put option, two answers. First, we think that it is not likely the put will be
exercised, so that's our assumption. And in case it was exercised, the fallback option, we
have some solutions to address the need for cash, and the fallback solution would be, I
don't know, to do an IPO with its 25% stake etc.
So all in all, what could be seen as not free, is free. So we still have the cash available. And
if you add up the EUR0.3 billion you mentioned at the beginning, plus the RPN(i), EUR370
million, plus the put option EUR1.2 billion[ph], by coincidence, we are at EUR1.9 billion,
which is the amount of cash. So all in all, we can claim that the cash is still free.

Q - Francois Boissin

{BIO 16045021 <GO>}

Yes, it's clear. Does that mean that basically if you do a further share buyback, you would
be happy to run with negative IFRS equity on the general account? Is this a fair statement,
or would you be prevented from going below zero?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

May be it's --

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

It's an analytical split. The capital of the general account per se doesn't exist.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

And the treatment of it would be different.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

I think, and I will further investigate, but for me, it is not impossible to go negative as it is
an analytical split.

A - Unidentified Speaker
And I think if you look at it probably a bit from the solvency perspective, the solvency is
protection of the insured. So the first element of solvency we look at, and the regulator
looks at, is the insurance solvency, although of course he requests us to deliver the full
calculation.

But I would not see a regulator immediately be alerted by the fact that we would go
beyond -- below our target of 200% -- of ourselves go below the 200%, as long as the
insurance activity is adequately capitalized. And as Bart mentioned, this is a view on the
Solvency I, on the Solvency II; and God knows when Solvency II will finally be applicable,
under Solvency II this effect is not there, of course.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

The put doesn't take this under Solvency II.

Two questions. On the M&A front, I just wanted to know if you could give us just a little bit
more guidance. You have done in the past M&A that was probably sub-EUR200 million;
let's call it small bolt on. Let's say that an acquisition will be between EUR200 million and
EUR500 million would be larger bolt on, but it seems that in the market you have people
that are afraid of thinking about above EUR1 billion.
Now you can -- we can always disregard this and say, look, I don't know where this is
coming from but it's not exactly what you have been guiding, or everyone can actually
have their own beliefs. But could you reassure and say that what you're looking to do, it's
something that I would call larger bolt on, so in that EUR200 million to EUR500 million
range, which doesn't mean that you cannot go above, but at least will reassure people on
what you are thinking?
Because, on the other side, you do not want to be very explicit on the net cash position
on what you would like to leave there in general as a buffer, if you want.
And the second question is just on the nat cats[ph] for the Fourth Quarter. My
understanding is that you have EUR8 million nat cats in Belgium and, again, EUR20 million
in the UK for the Fourth Quarter. Is it like net of tax, gross of reinsurance like before? And
then especially the EUR8 million in Belgium, even if I do it pretax and I put it into the
household combined ratio, I find that the household combined ratio, it's still high, and I
don't understand. So excluding the nat cats, I still find it quite high versus an excellent
combined ratio in the past quarters.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

On the first question, I believe I have to somewhat disappoint you in not being able to
give guidance. I think the only thing we can say is refer to our past.

FINAL

We have done acquisitions that were indeed not EUR1 billion plus acquisitions. I think we
always look to the added value to the Group, the fitting in the strategy, but also look very
clearly to the capacity to deal with a number of operations. And I would say, if you look
around, you have all files of multiple billions, which is clearly above our capacity, or you
have more files in the range of EUR100 million to some hundred millions.
So we will each time drive ourselves dizzy[ph] by are we able to add value, do we have
the capacity to manage this, and is it fitting with our strategic and financial criteria. So at
this moment, to be sure, I don't see files on our table that exceed the EUR1 billion. So if
that is a certain comfort we give to the market and to you, then you can note that down.
The second question on the combined -- on the impact in Q4. The -- I was a bit surprised
by your comment on Belgian combined ratio. I'm looking to it, and if you see the cat
nat[ph] total impact in 2013 in Belgium was quite in line with the one the year before. The
only difference is that in 2012, it was more positioned in the First Quarter where it was
now in the Second Quarter.
But if I look to the combined ratio in household, it's at level of 97%, and the year before it
was also 96.7%, coming from combined ratios that were in the area of 110/120% the years
before. So I would say with 97% combined ratio, also taking into account the quite short
period of settling of household claims and the financial income, this is certainly a business
line where you have something like 15% to 20% return on equity.

Q - Jason Kalamboussis

{BIO 4811408 <GO>}

Great. So coming just back on the Fourth Quarter, it is around EUR13 million for the whole
year of nat cats; around EUR8 million, let's say, in the Fourth Quarter; and EUR20 million is
the UK nat cats for the Fourth Quarter.

A - Unidentified Speaker
(Multiple speakers). It's EUR8 million net at (inaudible). But I think -- I understand you tried
to focus on the various quarters, but I think that's probably something you should not do.
A quarter on a portfolio, that has a real risk. And don't forget[ph] the real risk; we are
insuring clients here. That's completely normal that there's some variation. So I can
confirm, if that's your question; EUR8 million, that's what I have.

Q - Jason Kalamboussis

{BIO 4811408 <GO>}

But for Belgium, it was up in the Fourth Quarter?

A - Unidentified Speaker
Absolutely, yes.
And gross it was EUR18 million, yes.

FINAL

And this was the last question in the queue. Mr. De Smet, would you like to begin closing
comments?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your good questions. I would like to end the
call with some main conclusions.
I think we can say that we are all overall pleased that in 2013 we have once more been
able to report strong insurance results and that we've been delivering on our promises.
Inflows continue to grow. We have maintained our strength and our market positions in
the key markets. Both in life and non-life, the operating margins evolved well and are in
line with our objectives.

Bloomberg Transcript

Also, in 2013, we managed to reduce the complexity and the risk profile of Ageas.
Disciplined cash management remains one of the key objectives for the entire
management team. And, finally, the increase of the proposed dividend underlies the
efforts of the Board and the management of Ageas to consider the return for the
shareholder and the confidence in the health of our Company.
Don't hesitate to contact our Investor Relations team should you have outstanding
questions. Thanks for your time, and I wish you a very good day.
Good bye.

Thank you, Mr. De Smet. So, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.
