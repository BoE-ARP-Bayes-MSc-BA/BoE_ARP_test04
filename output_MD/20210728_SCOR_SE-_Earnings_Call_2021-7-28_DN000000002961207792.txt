Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the SCOR H1 2021 Results Call.
Today's call is being recorded. There will be an opportunity to ask questions after the
presentation. In order to give all participants a chance to ask questions, we kindly ask you
to limit the number of your questions to two. In order to give all participants -At this time, I would like to hand the call over to Mr. Olivier Armengaud. Please go ahead,

Good afternoon, and welcome to SCOR H1 2021 results call. My name is Olivier
Armengaud, Senior Manager in Investor Relations team; and I'm joined on the call today
by Laurent Rousseau, CEO of SCOR; and the entire Executive Committee. And I please

Laurent Rousseau

{BIO 19524847 <GO>}

Thank you, Olivier, and welcome everyone. Today is my first quarterly results as CEO of
SCOR and I'm pleased to present strong headline numbers demonstrating our ability to
create value as well as our resilience. Quite a few moving parts as quite of you have
noted today. So, I'm going to shed light on three important drivers that we see. The first
one is on the underlying performance of the business. The business engines remained
solid despite sustained cat activity. First of all, both of our business engines generated
good growth. This growth is profitable. If you look in P&C, our attritional loss ratio is
significantly better than our Quantum Leap guidance. And on the Life side, we reiterate
our Life technical margin guidance for the year. And on the asset side, we revised our
return on invested asset guidance in the upper part of our initial range. And we have
already started reinvesting our liquidities from the Covea transaction and we'll continue to
do so proactively till the end of the year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now, the second driver is if you look at the COVID impacts and, of course, the pandemic
is having quite an impact on both our Life and P&C businesses. On the P&C side, we
received further data from clients that led us to increase the provision for COVID-related
business and mostly these interruptions. On the Life business, it continues to be impacted
by COVID claims, although this is in line what -- with what we've already communicated to
you. Since March 2020, SCOR has reserved for around a EUR1 billion of COVID-related
claims. This is meaningful and demonstrate our ability to absorb shocks. And we have
been managing those exposures proactively.
The third driver is the conclusion of the settlement agreement with Covea. This
settlement took place at the very end of the quarter on June 30th. It marks a very
important milestone for the Group. It crystallizes the value of SCOR Life reinsurance
portfolio, which is a very important point, we -- as it demonstrates the often
underappreciated value of our Life business. It also enables SCOR to focus on its core
business and reveal the working relationship with a leading insurer. Finally, it provides
SCOR additional degrees of freedom to manage its capital and pursue its growth.
Overall, I would say these results show our strengths in a volatile environment and they
are on track with the strategic plan, Quantum Leap.
I will turn over to Ian. Once he walks you through the key financials of the quarter, I will
then provide a perspective on what you can expect over the coming few months from me
and from us, and we will conclude with a Q&A session. Thank you. Ian, over to you.

Ian Kelly

{BIO 19976646 <GO>}

Thanks, Laurent, and good afternoon, everybody. As Laurent said, it's a busy quarter.
There are quite a few moving parts. And I would like to highlight upfront that the
underlying performance of the business is very strong.

FINAL

Let's move to the settled agreement reached with Covea, and to reinforce Laurent's
comment, the key thing to note about this transaction is that it demonstrates the value in
the Life business and our ability to unlock that value. I think it's helpful if I walk through the
mechanics of the transaction. The agreement provides for reinsurance of 30% of all of
the in-force business carried by the SCOR Life Irish entities.
The impact on our financials is very positive. Firstly, it is beneficial for the solvency ratio.
We receive a cash commission for the best estimate of the future cash flows. And the -we receive a cash commission for the best estimate of the future cash flows, the benefit
comes from the associated risk margin with the business that is released. This is positive
for eligible own funds, and combined with the reduced solvency capital requirement on
the business ceded, leads to a solvency impact of approximately plus 27 percentage
points.
On the IFRS accounting side, against the commission received, we have movements in
DAC and VOBA and the support of a strong net reserving position on the portfolio. The
resulting impact on the P&L is a positive EUR311 million of income, net of tax. This includes
EUR20 million pretax in respect of the indemnity settlement paid by Covea and EUR30
million pretax in recognition of the value as at June 30th of the call option granted to
SCOR by Covea on the shares it holds.

Bloomberg Transcript

Other impacts of the transaction are, of course, that the cash position is strengthened.
The cash commission was received on July 1st. SCOR now benefits from strong flexibility
to fuel profitable growth. So, those are the key features of the Covea transaction.
Let's look at the other key metrics of the quarter on the next slide. In H1 2021, SCOR
continued to successfully develop its franchise. Gross written premium stand at EUR8.4
billion. This is up 9.1% at constant exchange rates compared to H1 2020, driven by P&C up
14.3% benefiting from the excellent renewals during the year and steady Life growth up
5.2% with continued franchise expansion in Asia. Following the execution of the Life
reinsurance treaties with Covea and the robust performance of the underlying business,
SCOR delivers a net income of EUR380 million in H1 2021, translating into an ROE of 12.2%.
Let's have a look at the business performance, starting with P&C first. We've published
combined ratio of 97.2% in H1. The underlying development of the attritional ratio is
strong, but Q2 was impacted by a charge of EUR109 million before tax for expected
COVID-19 claims as more information has been received from cedents regarding
business interruption. The P&C business was also heavily impacted by cat events related
to the Q1 Texas winter storm and Q2 European storms. On a normalized basis, for cat and
COVID-19, the P&C combined ratio stands at 91.2%, better than the Quantum Leap
assumption. In this context, we confirm our guidance for 2021 with a normalized combined
ratio trending towards 95% and below.
On the Life side, we had two significant impacts in the quarter, the continuous
development of COVID-19 in line with expectations as well as the benefit from the
retrocession treaties concluded with Covea. First, the impact from COVID-19 on the
mortality block is reducing and is tracking in line with our epidemiological model. Excluding

FINAL

the trend -- the Covea transaction, the Life technical margin stands at 3.1% for the first half
and we should return to Quantum Leap assumptions in Q4 2021 with an underlying full
year technical margin of 5%. If we now account for the one-off gains on the treaties ceded
to Covea, the net technical result would increase by EUR346 million and translates into a
Life technical margin of 13.1% for the half year.
On the investment side, the return on invested assets stands at 2.5% in H1, driven by
realized gains on the fixed income portfolio in Q1, offset by the continuous low yield
environment. The normalization of the asset allocation should be visible by the end of the
year. The return on invested assets expectation for full year 2021 is revised to the upper
part of the previously communicated range and stands between 2.0% and 2.3%.
Finally, in this context, the solvency of the Group is very strong at the end of H1, estimated
at 245%. This is above the Group's optimal solvency range of 185% to 220%. The increase
in solvency was mainly driven by 27 percentage points positive impact as of January 1,
2021 from the retrocession with Covea. The sensitivity of solvency ratio to interest rates is
reduced due to the retrocession agreement. Finally, the positive impact from the
operating capital generation and market movements is partially offset by model changes
and COVID-19 impacts.

Bloomberg Transcript

Briefly on a few other key financials. The shareholders' equity of the Group remains strong
at EUR6.3 billion after taking into account the dividend payment. This is an increase on the
year-end position and results in a book value of almost EUR34 per share. And finally, I
would like to highlight the strong cash flow of the Group with net cash flow from
operations exceeding EUR0.5 billion.
With that, I will hand back to Laurent. Thank you.

Laurent J. Rousseau

{BIO 19524847 <GO>}

Thank you, Ian. Before getting into the Q&A, I would like to first of all layout what you,
investors and analysts, can expect from me as CEO, and second, share with you how we
have planned for the coming few months to prepare the ground for the next strategic
plan and the future growth of the business.
So, first of all, what can you expect from me as CEO? The first thing is engagement. You
are one of the key stakeholders of the Group and you're important to me. So, you can
count on the fact that I would spend time with you, our investors, listen to what you have
to say and hear your candid feedback. Personally, I started my career 20 years ago in the
markets and I intend to stay closely in touch with you. Secondly, you can expect me to be
transparent and candid. I will share my views on where the Group stands as well as the
opportunities and the challenges that we face.
Now, what to expect from us in the coming few months? First of all, we have decided to
extend Quantum Leap plan for one more year. The key reason is that I want to use the
time to properly review the performance of our business, our operational discipline, our
invested asset mix and the efficiency of our capital deployments.

So, what can you expect at our upcoming September Investor Day? We will make it
shorter than usual and nonetheless provide important updates on the current business
environments, life and health as well as P&C reinsurance markets are going through
volatile times, yet we see clear and attractive opportunities to grow our franchise, in
particular in P&C. On the asset side, there is also scope for normalization of our
investment strategy. We will lay out the broad directions of our future strategic plan,
where do we see opportunities to improve our returns, our capital deployment strategy
and our strategic priorities as a management team. The results of today show clearly that
we have some options to redeploy our capital and cash. I can tell you we will find the right
balance between seizing growth opportunities in P&C, re-risking our assets and keep
some flexibility in an environment marked by high natural catastrophes and COVID.
Finally, at the Investor Day, I will also communicate the timing and the discipline process
through which we will produce our next strategic plan. I already know that this plan will
include more of your inputs and objectives than it has been the case in the past. To
achieve this, I will ask you for your time after the Investor Day to meet and discuss your
individual inputs and objectives. I really want to be able to fully understand them and
include them in our planning.
With that, I will hand over back to Olivier for the Q&A session. Thank you.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) And we do have our first question from Vikram
Gandhi from Societe Generale.

Q - Vikram Gandhi

{BIO 18019785 <GO>}

Hello. Hi. It's Vik from SocGen. Hope all of you are doing fine. I've got two questions.
Firstly, I wondered if you can share what is the right way of thinking about the attrition in
the life and health operating result due to the agreement with Covea? I mean, looking at
slide 34 probably annualizing the EUR621 million of premiums and applying a 7.3% margin
is one way, but -- and then this should reduce over time as the portfolio runs off, but
would be great to get your thoughts. And secondly, can you please share what kind of
COVID-19 impact are you assuming in the Solvency II ratio going forward? And related to
that, what's the level of IBNR claims for the COVID results on the P&C side? Thank you.

So -- yeah, hi. Hi, Vikram. I mean, firstly on the impact on the technical margin on the Life
business unit, certainly on the Life side, we do see ceded premiums. And what we would
do is certainly we confirmed that for 2021, the technical margin guidance excluding the
one-off impacts of the retrocession agreement, the technical margin is confirmed at 5%
for the full year. And then when it comes to Investor Day, we'll be confirming the impacts
on the technical margin for 2022. But to be clear, as Laurent has laid out, I mean, what we
have done here is we've crystallized the value that we would have done earlier than we
would have done, and that's at the heart of this transaction. So, we've done that, we
maintain conservative margins within the portfolio and we will come back at Investor Day
to describe how we're going to use the additional capital benefits that we get from this to
enhance the earning power of the business. So, that's the (Technical Difficulty)

A - Laurent Rousseau

{BIO 19524847 <GO>}

I think we've lost Ian. Maybe we can move to the second question on the COVID
expectations and solvency ratio. Frieder, do you want to take that?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Frieder Knupling

{BIO 17247809 <GO>}

Yeah. I can take that. So, as far as incurred claims are concerned, the solvency treatment is
completely in line with IFRS and we have obviously -- particularly reflected the
strengthening of our P&C reserves for COVID-related claims. There is -- for Solvency II,
there is also an allowance for future claims, and that's particularly irrelevant for the Life
business, where as we demonstrated in previous quarters, we are holding additional
reserves for expected claims in the coming quarters. This hasn't changed a lot since the
last quarter. There are slight movements. We are updating the models on a regular basis
and also taking into account actual claims emergence for the past quarters, but that -- the
outlook is largely consistent with what we've presented in Q4 and Q1.

A - Laurent Rousseau

{BIO 19524847 <GO>}

Jean-Paul, do you want to take the question on IBNR share in P&C?

A - Jean-Paul Conoscente

{BIO 20770277 <GO>}

Yes. So, hello, everyone. On the P&C side, you have in the presentation deck on page
nine the -- a chart of the ultimate reserves we have for COVID and the amount of paid
claims. As you can see at the end of Q2, we paid only EUR58 million of claims for COVID.

Q - Vikram Gandhi

{BIO 18019785 <GO>}

Jean-Paul, if I can just come back on that, that's the paid claims to the ultimate, but that
will not necessarily be reflective of the IBNR position. Right?

A - Jean-Paul Conoscente

{BIO 20770277 <GO>}

Yeah. But the rest are our case reserves in IBNR. The majority of our claims after this
quarter are property BI. And so, most of that would be case reserves.

Our next question comes from Kamran Hossain with RBC Capital Markets.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Two questions. The first one is, I guess, on the
redeployment of capital. It sounds like -- it's ahead of the IR Day and ahead of the kind of
plan more fairly, you're planning to deploy more of the capital into P&C versus Life. Could
you maybe talk about the relative returns that you see between those two businesses at
the moment? I guess, it's a little bit difficult to really back it out without the segmental
balance sheet. And the second question is, I guess, on COVID losses coming back to that,
also the BI piece has obviously got a little bit worse in the quarter. Can you talk about the
status of the credit and surety claims at the moment and whether these have crystallized
at all? Thank you.

A - Ian Kelly

{BIO 19976646 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks, Kamran. And firstly on the capital deployment, right. Firstly, we're in a strong
position on the capital side as a result of the transaction. That's clear. We really do benefit
here. And this brings us more degrees of freedom in how we review the position, how we
redeploy that capital. And as we said and as you point out, once we get to IR Day, we can
talk about that a little bit more. And we'll talk about how we allocate the capital, where we
see the opportunities in the market, how we view the capital return policy, and there are
certainly key areas to highlight on, namely the P&C market where we see good growth
opportunities and on the asset allocation which may -- remains extremely prudent at the
moment, that could be normalized.
Now, we will talk about the relative returns in answer to the question. We will always seek
to deploy the capital where we see the best value for the shareholders. It's a little early
now at this point to talk to those relative returns and exactly how we're going to deploy
Page 7 of 20

this. We just concluded the transaction on the last day of the quarter, but it's on our radar.
We're working on this and we'll speak more about it.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

FINAL

Thanks, Ian.

A - Jean-Paul Conoscente

{BIO 20770277 <GO>}

And this is Jean-Paul, on the COVID P&C losses specific to credit and surety. So, our view
is based on the information received from our cedents. The results are coming in, the
estimates are coming in much better than we had anticipated. And this is mainly due to
the government actions taken to shore up the trade credit environment in the different
economies worldwide, as well as the underwriting actions taken by the credit and surety
and underwriters in pretty much every country, not only price increases, but the shrinking
of limits, repositioning of the portfolio and focusing on less risky sectors relative to the
economic environment. So -- and what we see actually is the results for the -- some of the
large trade credit insurers are actually better than the results pre-COVID. So, we remain
very bullish on the trade -- on the credit and surety market overall and believe that that
portfolio even if the environment deteriorates in 2022, 2023 is in a very good position to
withstand that deterioration if it happens.

Q - Kamran Hossain

A - Olivier Armengaud

{BIO 20892984 <GO>}

Thanks, Kamran. Can we take the next question, please?

A - Laurent Rousseau

{BIO 19524847 <GO>}

Maybe one thing that we can say on the returns on the P&C side. What we're seeing at
the moment is that couple of points of improvement in the underwriting ratio. So, if you
look back in time over the cycles, for sure in terms of return on allocated capital, we've
been quite steadily improving, getting to fairly good levels over the cycle.

Company N ame: SCOR SE

Hi, there. I'm sorry to go back to this topic. This is addressed particularly for Laurent. I think
investors need more reassurance that the deal you conducted with Covea is in the end
ROE accretive and over a fairly short timeframe because from the information we have
today, we will be taking down earnings expectations for the Life business by 20% or
something like that for the session. There is no clarity on whether any capital is going to
be deployed. You haven't referred to the fact that -- I would hope the hurdle rate for
deployment is at least the ROI on your own shares, which looks very attractive and also
the fact that you possibly need to address your cost of equity inflated by the fact you are
one of the few financials to have not caught up on the unpaid dividend from 2019. So, I
just want a clear message that you're seeking to enhance earnings power net rapidly and
the transaction with Covea will be ROE additive in the end in a short timeframe. I'm not
sure we've really got that message clearly yet so far, sorry to be so blunt.
Secondly, can I just have some clarity as to what belief you have in that normalized
combined ratio? It's very low, it's very impressive, but obviously the cat loading looked
quite high for a benign quarter. So, maybe just give us a sense as to your sense, is there
any other normalization we should do for the underlying combined ratio and/or your latest
thoughts are on the right cat budget?

A - Laurent Rousseau

{BIO 19524847 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Andrew. So, let me take your first -- I don't know if it's a question or a
comment, but I'll answer. And I'll let Jean-Paul talk about the normalized combined ratio.
On the ROE accretive, so the answer is yes. Your message is loud and clear. It is indeed
what I meant when I talked of capital deployment earlier on. And it is as well what I was
alluding to on my -- on the P&C returns comments that we're seeing today rate of returns,
including on capital on equity that are very strong. So, clearly, the earnings are going to be
gone in this -- in the Covea transaction will be replaced and we strongly believe that they
will be accretive to the ROE.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

Do you think that can be --

A - Laurent Rousseau

{BIO 19524847 <GO>}

Yeah, Andrew.

Sorry. I mean, are we talking replacement over many years or what's the kind of trajectory
we should think about?

The -- on the normalized net combined ratio, I think your question is -- has two questions
in it. One relates to the cat ratio, the other one relates to the normalized combined ratio.
If we look at the normalized net combined ratio, the cat ratio of 7% is comparable to what
we used in last year. And if you add the commissions and the attritional loss ratio,
excluding COVID, you see a 5 point improvement overall compared to last year. The -that improvement comes from two parts, one is roughly 1 to 1.5 points of improvement
because of the lower man made losses in H1 2021 compared to 2020, that could be
partially related to lower economic activity because of COVID. The second part is simply
pricing improvement. And we need to validate whether this continues for the rest of the
year, but there is no normalization needed there.
On your question on the cat ratio, it's something that we're looking at very closely and
we'll come back to you at the IR Day. But the fact that we've only reached our cat ratio
budget in one year over the last five years is something that, of course, we've noted and
are studying and we'll come back to you with more information at the IR Day on this.

Our next question comes from Will Hardcastle of UBS.

Q - Will Hardcastle

{BIO 16346311 <GO>}

Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll try one more way on the capital allocation. I know
we're going to get more color on the Capital Markets Day. I guess, very strong Q&A
session, it feels like we're talking here about your opportunity of P&C, the return on
capital is improving and that's where we'll get most of the replacement on earnings. I
guess to the point that we were currently -- you were currently operating above the top
end of the target range before the settlement. So, what was constraining you before to
grow P&C more at these return on capital levels? Or am I missing something here?
And then perhaps just on the COVID claims in P&C, is there any chance we can get some
more color on these? When were the specific court cases, for example, when will be the
notifications coming in? I guess, what's the new information or the learning, is it specific
numbers you've just being informed about? And then is it just these two cases that you
worked for or is there an extrapolation within your increase? Sorry, there's a lot of very
minor questions within that color, just some more color would be great.

A - Ian Kelly

{BIO 19976646 <GO>}

Thanks. Well, it's Ian here. Firstly on the capital deployment, with the solvency now at
extremely strong position, you questioned what was constraining prior -- the growth prior

FINAL

to the Covea transaction. We operate under a variety of constraints, we lead the Group
by the Group internal model under the solvency metric, but we have other constraints
including rating capital constraints. We do maintain an excess over AAA to have our AA
minus credit rating with S&P, for example, but these -- that's a constraint under which we
operate. Now, the transaction that we have concluded at the end of the quarter is very
positive from a rating capital context, so that's good. And that gives us more degrees of
freedom and flexibility when it comes to the growth opportunities that we have.

A - Jean-Paul Conoscente

This is Jean-Paul, I'll tackle the second question on the P&C business interruption claims.
So, again, this relates to affirmative coverage for business interruption. The main drivers
as we noted in the presentation have been an increase of the gross losses estimated by
our clients, primarily coming out of the UK and France. There has been -- France doesn't
have any centralized data I can refer you to, but the UK does. The FCA has published
information showing both the number of claims accepted and paid by insurers as well as
the amount paid. And what we see is the number of claims as well as the amount paid by
insurers in the UK between the middle of March and the middle of July has more or less
doubled in that timeframe. So, this has led our clients to review and revise upwards their
own estimates. And then we apply those growth estimates with our own assumptions to
the reinsurance treaties. And so, this is the driver between our -- behind our increase of
COVID reserves.

Q - Will Hardcastle

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 20770277 <GO>}

{BIO 16346311 <GO>}

Okay. So, just to follow-up, and very specific to those specific cedents and it's not
something that we should consider like in the risk of extrapolation beyond those. Is that
fair?

A - Jean-Paul Conoscente

{BIO 20770277 <GO>}

Well, we -- that's fair. I think the markets we see were the biggest amount of litigations
and I'd say the most negative development against insurers have been the UK and
France. And so, other countries, I think, the development is going in line with expectation.

Yes. Good afternoon, sir. Thank you. Some of my questions have been addressed. Maybe
if I could just ask again about the solvency. So, from Frieder's comment, I could
understand that the future claims has not changed a lot since the last quarter as I noted
from previous comment, but I'm still struggling to see, was there any major model
changes high single-digits that you would like to flag in some way or, I guess, versus the
1Q 232% and then the Covea settlement? I mean, I'm still struggling to see why we got
only to 245% with all that put in there. So, that's my first question on Solvency II.
The second question is more about the COVID, which you have kindly addressed just now.
But just on the P&C side, I mean, is the EUR58 million rather a low number as per what
you would have expected? And does it suggest to you that there is actually some more
buffers built in or should we interpret that the fact that you had to strengthen reserves in
2Q, means that last year the strength on the reserves wasn't very conservative. So, just
any comments additionally on this paid claim ratio being so low and the general reserving
[ph] confidence level for COVID will be very helpful. Thank you.

A - Frieder Knupling

{BIO 17247809 <GO>}

Okay. Hi, Vinit. On your question on the solvency movements in Q2 and what brought us
to the estimated level of 245%, there are a couple of one-offs, which lead to the fact that
the closing estimate is below just the simple sum of the Q1 estimate and the Covea
impact. First one is model changes, as we indicated in the pack. We had a couple of
model changes as we always do, we constantly improve the model and this leads to
sometimes positive, sometimes negative solvency impact. As it happened in Q2, the
aggregate impact of the model changes was negative and a little more significant than in
-- what we would have seen in previous periods, still a single-digit number in terms of
solvency ratio impact, but towards the higher end of what you would have seen in the
past. There was not a massive single model change, which caused this, but it's really more
a combination of different changes which have more coincidentally led to this impact this
quarter.
Secondly, the Covea deal has been assessed as of January 1st, which is the effective date
of the treaty. And that then leads to the solvency ratio impact estimate of plus 27
percentage points, which we mentioned. The retrocession does cede a significant portion
of our most interest rate sensitive business to Covea, and that includes interest rate
sensitive risk capital, which we've hold for this business and also risk margin. So, as a
consequence of that session, our interest rate sensitivity -- or the interest rate sensitivity
of our solvency ratio has reduced due to the deal. And that means that the impact of the
interest rate increases which we've seen in Q1 is then correspondingly lower. So, the
impact of interest rate movements over the first six months is less -- somewhat less than
what you would get if you used the sensitivities which we originally published in February
and then apply the interest rate movements which we've experienced in the first six
months.
And then finally, there is some impact of the COVID losses. We've, of course, taken, as I
said, the P&C losses. There have been small movements on the Life side, which have also
reduced solvency a little bit. And these three factors explain the big unusual movements
and everything else is really pretty much in line with what you would have seen in earlier
periods.

A - Jean-Paul Conoscente

{BIO 20770277 <GO>}

This is Jean-Paul. I'll try to address your second question on P&C COVID claims. I think the
EUR58 million paid at the end of Q2 really reflects the complexity of the claims settlement
around COVID. The -- I think when there is a clear presentation from our clients and no
questions asked about how the -- these claims are aggregated, we pay them very quickly.
But as you see, it's a very small number. The large number of claims remaining are first
complex for the cedents to get an assessment of their own exposures. And secondly,
there is more complexity about how those claims are ceded to the reinsurance treaties.
So, we see these -- this ratio probably lasting until the end of the year and probably into
2022. So, the majority of our ultimate claims estimates are based on our own estimates
based on information we receive from our cedents basically, it's a combination.

Next question comes from Ashik Musaddi of JP Morgan.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Just a couple of questions I have. First of
all going back to the topic around the normalized combined ratio. I mean, clearly, what you
are saying at the moment is 91.2% and actually it is even better based on one comment if
I understood it correctly, and that compares with 95% what you've been guiding for
Quantum Leap. So -- I mean, there is a material difference between the two. And clearly,
one of your comments suggested that we need to see what the pricing is going to do.
But if I look at some of your statement, pricing was still strong in July, you are expecting
pricing to be in the hard market next year as well. So, what is the reason you are not
improving this Quantum Leap 95% to say 93%, 92%, something like that? Some color on
that would be good.
And secondly just going back to the Covea thing. I mean, how should we think about
annual impact on earnings at the moment? Shall we just do -- like EUR300 million is the
profit you have booked, so say EUR30 million lower earnings until you redeploy the capital
or would you say that that math is not right? So -- because, I mean, there will be some
lead time on the capital deployment. I agree that you will give more color at the Investor
Day, but still there will be some delay. So, what should be the earnings impact going
forward in the short-term? Thank you.

A - Jean-Paul Conoscente

{BIO 20770277 <GO>}

Thanks. This is Jean-Paul. I'll start with the question on the net combined ratio. What we -looking at different actions we've taken over the past 18 months, we took significant
underwriting actions in 2020 to reposition the portfolio to be more profitable. And in
2021, we really accelerated the growth because of what we saw as improving market
conditions. As Laurent mentioned in our own pricing, we see year-on-year pricing
improvement between 2020-2021 more or less resulting in at least 2 points of
improvement of the loss ratio. We expected this to be earned over time. What we're
seeing in the first two quarters of 2021 is both the benefits of the underwriting actions
taken in 2020 as well as some of the earning of the better business in 2021. So, again, for
the time being, we haven't revised our guidance. We'll come back to you on this at the IR
Day, both for the rest of the year 2021 and in 2022.

A - Ian Kelly

{BIO 19976646 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And just on the second question, and the -- I'll come back to what I said earlier actually, in
that the way to look at this is not about earnings dilution. The -- what we've been able to
do is crystallize value now, get cash now first, cash flows that we would have had in the
future. And that's the key element here, that's at the heart of this transaction. Now, we do
get the capital benefit. The way I would look at this is not to start then to model
downwards. We are confident that we can deploy the capital and this is not going to be
dilutive. We can deploy this to enhance the earnings of the Group and we will come back
with our plans there. And so, yeah, that's how we're looking at this is -- we've received
this benefit of crystallizing and we shall deploy that.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from Thomas Fossard from HSBC.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Yes, good afternoon. Couple of questions on my side. The first one would be on the P&C.
If I'm looking at slide 32 of the pack, when I'm looking at net earned premium, I can still
see net earned premium falling by 4%, 5% compared to last year, while we are now 18 or
24 months into much better markets. So -- I mean, can you comment on why is it still the
case? And actually when we should expect net earned premium to turn to a more positive
or stronger number at some point?
The second question will be related again to the Covea deal and maybe to the origin of
this short duration of this deal. I mean, why 30%? Why 20% of the mortality book -- of the
US mortality book? Were there any more appetite from Covea and you refrained? Or -- I

FINAL

mean, just to better understand how the transaction has been sized up between both
parties and what have been the driver to decide which was the right amount.
And maybe connected to this. I mean, to be fair with you, I'm still struggling to understand
why we've got kind of a loss of 14 points of solvency if we are starting from the end of Q1,
and I think the 27 points from the Covea agreement. So, let me put the question
differently. If you would have potentially strengthened your balance sheet without showing
too much of the number of the impact of the Covea operation, would have been this -been possible by model changes? And at the end of the day, you're not showing too
much, but ultimately the balance sheet has significantly improved and this is also where
you're getting more confidence regarding your freedom for the future. Thank you.

A - Laurent Rousseau

{BIO 19524847 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So, Thomas, I'll start on the question on the net earned premium for P&C. So, the
difference you see between the numbers we showed for the gross written premium and
the net earned premium really relates to the earning of premium. So, if we look at 2020
earned premium, the earned premium at the first half 2020 was driven by the very strong
growth in 2019, and in some effect but very little of the repositioning of the portfolio and
the underwriting actions taken during the renewals in 2020. So, the -- I'd say the normal
earning patterns we saw in 2020 were stronger than I'd say usual.
In 2021, what we have is a flattish renewal of the portfolio in underwriting year 2020 plus
the effect of COVID where there was some premium take-downs on some lines of
business, like political risk, construction, which is earned through now in 2021 and we
haven't fully benefited of the underwriting increases we've achieved in underwriting year
2021. So, that explains the drop in net earned premium. We expect this to continue in
2000 -- in Q3 because the same effect will continue and we won't really start earning
significant amount of premium in Q3 from underwriting year 2021. But I think from Q4 and
then into the first quarter of 2022, you should really start seeing in the earned premium
the effect of the premium increase that we've achieved on a written basis in underwriting
year 2021.

A - Frieder Knupling

{BIO 17247809 <GO>}

Okay. On your second question, Thomas, Frieder speaking. The model changes, which
we've made in Q2, have nothing to do with the Covea transaction, if that was part of your
question. So, they were done completely independently part of our regular maintenance
of the model and now it's -- this is complete coincidence that they happened in Q2. As I
said, they are more significant than what you would have seen in previous periods. And
this explains a significant part of the difference between the simple sum of the Q1 ratio
and the Covea impact. And then the other somewhat minor but so not insignificant
movements are caused by the fact that the impact of interest rate movements and the
increase in interest rates post Covea is smaller. So, we've reduced interest rate sensitivity
of the solvency ratio by the session and that has led to a correspondingly lower impact on
the solvency ratio of the interest rate movements in Q1, plus there were the -- there was
the COVID deterioration mostly from P&C and these are the main one-offs which explain
the difference between the simple sum and the ratio which we are publishing.

Is that answering your question or --?

FINAL

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Yeah, yeah. No, I fully understood. Thanks for that. If you can say a word on, Laurent, the
calibration of the deal, on the appetite and why 30, and not 20 or not 40 or -- what was
the appetite, what was the constraints, what was -- anything on the calibration of this
transaction?

A - Paolo De Martin

{BIO 15930577 <GO>}

I'll take this, this is Paolo. Hi, everybody. First of all, there was a strong willingness between
the two parties to resume meaningful commercial relationships, and that was identified as
one area that was beneficial to both parties. Negotiations per se are confidential. And so,
going too much into the details I don't think is appropriate in this (Technical Difficulty) From
our side perspective, we felt that that level of session would bring a strong rebalancing to
the -- to our Life portfolio as we cede about 20% of our US mortality business. That gives
us a much more balanced portfolio between the US and the remaining global franchise.

Bloomberg Transcript

Just to note a few comments made before. I just want to underline this, this crystallizes
EUR1 billion of economic value of the franchise effectively. So, I find surprising some of the
comments on the dilution reinforcing what Ian said because effectively this crystallizes
future cash flows into today. We know risk margin effectively. So, we thought the deal on
our side was again very beneficial economically and also very strong rebalancing, and
we're going to show more data on the rebalancing as we get to the Investor Day in
September.
I don't know if that answers your question, Thomas?

Q - Thomas Fossard

Our next question comes from James Shuck of Citi.

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Hi, there. Good morning, good afternoon. More questions on the capital side of things,
I'm afraid. Thank you for the commitment to greater transparency, Laurent. It would be
helpful to get an update on where you stand in terms of rating agency capital over that
AAA level pro forma for the Covea deal, please. Because when I look at your Solvency II
ratio kind of rolling it forward and think about how you manage that, it seems to me that
you're going to have to periodically securitize the Life in-force book from time-to-time, so

Page 16 of 20

FINAL

that you can increase the rating agency surplus. So, if you could just clarify your thinking
around that.
And again, when I think about the exposure growth that we've seen in the first half of this
year, really all of it is rate-driven rather than exposure, and yet you are alluding to the fact
that you think you can grow quite strongly in P&C re. So, keen also to understand where
that growth is going to come from. Whether you are actually specifically referring to
exposure growth and whether that growth is going to be more than the retained earnings
after the ordinary dividend? Because the -- I would have thought that it would be selffunding and therefore the stock of capital, again, just thinking about how you manage that
down with the leaders you've got. And appreciate the Capital Markets Day is coming up
fairly soon in September, but it's an important point to dwell on I think.
The second kind of question or area, I think, is a much shorter one. And Laurent, you
alluded to flexibility when you talked about the optimal capital position. Could you just
update us with your thoughts around potential M&A? And I don't think I heard the answer
to Andrew's question earlier on, but how do you think about the ROI when it comes to
M&A versus, say, share buybacks? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Ian Kelly

{BIO 19976646 <GO>}

Yeah. Hi, James. Just firstly then on the S&P impact, I mean, we maintain, as I said, an
excess over AAA. We don't disclose our margins over AAA. Certainly, the transaction, as I
said earlier, it was very positive on a direct S&P capital model basis. Just need to
remember that the transaction took place on the last day of the quarter. So, how we now
think about balancing the capital that we've received under the various measures and
what impact it has as we deploy this on IFRS earnings, on our solvency, on the S&P capital,
on the cash profile of the Group as we deploy that, that just takes a little bit of time. It was
-- it's a complex transaction, it's very beneficial across these metrics. We just need to think
through how that's going to be applied to ensure that it is accretive and that we are
managing to the targets of the Group, yet within the constraints that we have. I think we -as I said, we will come back at IR Day with more color around the approach there.

A - Laurent Rousseau

{BIO 19524847 <GO>}

Jean-Paul, do you want to take on next quarter growth in P&C?

A - Jean-Paul Conoscente

{BIO 20770277 <GO>}

Sure. So, I think your comments must relate to the June-July renewals, where indeed the
growth is more or less in line with the price increases we've seen. And the June-July
renewals are dominated by the US. In the US, the question is not so much the price
increases, but more the claim inflation. And our view is that both across property and
casualty, the price increases are barely keeping up with loss trend on both segments.
Therefore, there's a lot of underwriting actions behind those numbers that took place in
June-July, where the end result is more or less a growth in line with price increases.
If we look across the year, we are growing our reinsurance book almost 11% and 11%-plus
throughout the year and we definitely did not achieve 11% rate increases. So, there is
Page 17 of 20



Company N ame: SCOR SE
Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity
Date: 2021-07-28

FINAL

exposure growth there as well. On the specialty insurance, we've had significant growth
this quarter in the finances. Our specialty insurance grows on a gross written premium
basis almost 30%. And again, the average rate increases we see across different lines of
business is about 15%. So, I think there is both price movement as well as exposure
movement in that growth. And as we look at 2022 and review the market conditions that
we expect there, I think you'll see similar projections that we anticipate in 2022.

A - Laurent Rousseau

{BIO 19524847 <GO>}

On your question James on -- actually I think that's two questions, one is on the M&A
environment and the other one is how do we decide to allocate capital and how do we
identify opportunities inorganic ones versus organic ones. So, first of all on M&A, look, our
approach here is very much the same in the sense that we do not plan on M&A in our
plans and we take an opportunistic approach as and when. If you look back in history, I
mean, the market is hard at the moment, and particularly on the P&C side. So, we do see
a number of very attractive opportunities. We have the capital to grow. So, the addition of
a franchise in such a market will actually -- would be potentially more disruptive to our
ability to really focus on underwriting the business. So, we don't change our approach to
M&A.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the second point on the flexibility, how do we compare the various rates of returns? I
mean, clearly, we will keep all options in mind when we look at the flexibility of deploying
our capital, whether it is to invest it, I think we've already alluded to the asset risk. I think
this is something as well that Francois and his teams are looking at quite closely. There is a
pretty interesting number of organic opportunities, I would say. And in the way we look at
capital return, this is something that we will be exploring at the other end going forward.

European flood loss really, any comments whether it'd be industry loss expectation, your
comments on that, anything we should maybe extrapolate from the Q2 European storm
loss for Q3 flood loss, any high level commentary would be helpful. And secondly, I think
on the solvency ratio, we know the ratio, I'm just checking if I -- is there anywhere where
you published the numerator or denominator in that ratio? I guess, there's a lot of moving
parts on the model change, et cetera. Any guidance to what we can have as the
denominator at this point? Thanks.

A - Jean-Paul Conoscente

{BIO 20770277 <GO>}

So, I'll start with the European flood question. So, yeah, as you noted, the Q2 events that
we booked are the European connected storms that took place in the Czech Republic
and the adjacent countries. The market loss estimates for those events, they happened
at the end of June, so the estimates are very rough -- or between EUR3 billion to EUR5
billion. The European floods that took place in July will be part of the Q3 results. And
there, we saw recently an estimate from the German Insurance Association of a range of
4 -- EUR5 billion to EUR6 billion just for Germany to which probably we have to add
Belgium and other places. So, I'd say what you can see in Q2 is probably indicative of what
we can expect for Q3 and probably the events that we have in Q3 are worse than the
ones in Q2.
