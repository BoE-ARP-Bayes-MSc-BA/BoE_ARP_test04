Presentation
Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. My name is Gianandrea Roberti, I'm the Head of Investor
Relations of Tryg. We published our Q1 results earlier on this morning and I have here with
me Morten Hubbe, Group CEO; Barbara Plucnar Jensen, CFO; and Johan Kirstein
Brammer, Group CCO.
Morten, over to you.

Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Thank you, Gian, and welcome from my side as well. We will start on Slide 3, where we
show the ﬁnancial highlights of Q1. We clearly see a large positive swing with an increase
of DKK1.4 billion in the pre-tax results, reﬂecting of course very, very diﬀerent capital
markets year-on-year. Technical result is up almost 12% driven by good underlying
improvements Alka synergies and lower weather and large claims. Underlying claims
improved 80 basis points, while ﬂattened private lines, it improved strongly in commercial
and corporate lines, where improvements are more needed.

FINAL

Investment income beneﬁts from good returns on equities in Q1, but do bear in mind that
in this Q1, DKK156 million positive is related to FX derivative contract that is actually
related to the RSA deal and has little to do with the ongoing business. Solvency is
reported at 899, not very meaningful, but of course, including the rights issue and more
appropriate 180 adjusted for the rights issue.
On Slide 4, we show a new method of measuring customer satisfaction. The advantage is
that the new method includes both touch points, like for instance calling or going online
to buying insurance in a single touch point as well as now a full process for instance a
claims handling from A to Z that could cover multiple touch points and multiple touch
channels. The internal beneﬁt is clear that we will get much more data, many more data
points and it will give us much more nuance to constantly improve our future customer
satisfaction.

Bloomberg Transcript

We're very pleased that the overall customer satisfaction improves from 83% to 84%, but
actually underlying there is a lot of variation. We see for instance that there's an 82%
satisfaction on online claims, compared to for instance a 93% satisfaction when a
customer calls our customer service in private. And all of that, variation will give us a lot of
data to create a lot of further improvements, which typically helps the retention rates and
helps earnings.
On Slide 5, which show the composition of the technical result. Group technical result
improves, as I said almost 12% to DKK751 million, positively impacted by improved
underlying claims ratio in Alka synergies. It should be noted of course that the economic
activity in society was lower year-on-year, which has improved claims frequency in several
products.
Private lines and commercial SME performed very well in the quarter, whereas the
corporate segment was impacted by an increase in large chains of roughly 10 percentage
points year-on-year and also a lower level of one-oﬀ gains. But on the positive side, we've
seen improved underlying claims ratio on corporate due to both the price increases and
the reductions in insurance exposure and in particularly, we see this improvement in
corporate Norway, but also in corporate Denmark and Sweden.
On Slide 6, we give a helicopter view of the COVID-19 impacts. This Q1 total impact from
COVID-19 was positive due to mainly a much lower level of travel claims. We've seen a
somewhat higher number of motor claims year-on-year, but bear in mind the high growth
in the number of cars insured which means that all in all the ﬁgures represent a slight drop
in frequency on motor.
Over to you, Johan.

Johan Kirstein Brammer

{BIO 18640275 <GO>}

Thanks, Morten. And on Page 7, we are showing an updated timetable of the RSA
transaction and it is essentially a re-run our previous timelines. I should add though that in
Q1, we closed one of the largest rights issues in many years and successfully issued a new

FINAL

Tier 1 loan. We have already obtained approvals from diﬀerent authorities, including
antitrust approvals in Denmark, Sweden and Norway and we continue to expect the
acquisition to close in Q2 2021.
Turning to Page 8, we show that the synergies from Alka continue to be delivered
according to plan and in Q1 DKK28 million was achieved in synergies bringing us to a
total of DKK204 million. In this slide, we detailed the synergies split between claims, costs
and revenues according to plan. We're still conﬁdent that we will achieve the promised
synergies related to the Alka acquisition amounting to DKK300 million in 2021.
We also believe that we've learned a lot from the Alka acquisition and we will be able to
replicate these learnings in the RSA acquisition. It gives us additional comfort around the
announced synergies of DKK900 million in 2024.
And with that, back to you Morten.

Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Thank you, Johan. And on Slide 9, we continue with the development in shareholders'
remuneration. For the ﬁrst quarter of this year, we are paying a dividend of DKK1.07 per
share, giving a total amount of DKK700 million. The quarterly dividend will be ﬂat for the
coming three quarters, even if 2021 is an unusual year, both considering the equity
accounting that will start in the second half of the year of the acquired assets while we
wait for the demerger, but also the bookings of restructuring and transaction-related
costs.
As mentioned previously, our pro forma technical result will roughly double by 2024 from
the 2019 and 2020 base and the dividend trajectory will follow that part of roughly
doubling, making Tryg a strong dividend stock also in the future.
Back to you, Johan.

Johan Kirstein Brammer

{BIO 18640275 <GO>}

Thank you, Morten. And that brings us into our next section, premiums and portfolio. And
on Page 11, we illustrate that for Q1, top line growth was 6.2% driven by growth in all
segments. Private lines is the most proﬁtable area and therefore, we are very satisﬁed with
the growth in this segment of 7.8%. Commercial had a growth of 5.3%, which was a
combination of organic growth in Denmark and for Norway, it was driven by price
increases for especially larger customers.
Corporate showed a positive growth of 3.8% and was impacted by proﬁtability initiatives
in all countries. In general, it's important to stress that growth is not key in the corporate
business. What matters here is improvement in proﬁtability across all countries. Sweden
showed a growth of 1.2% driven primarily by price adjustments and organic growth.

Turning to Page 12, we illustrate that adjusting prices in accordance with claims inﬂation is
very important and a key focus area and we therefore, closely monitor the development in
average pricing. Proﬁtability improvement is a combination of claims initiatives and price
adjustments. The average price development shown is also impacted by a change in a
large partner agreements. In Q2 2020, we did see a drop in the average price for house
in Norway, which was ascribed to a reduction in prices for a very big partner agreement.
There's also impacts to development in Q1 2021, and therefore, we see a low average to
increase in price for house in Norway.
Turning to Page 13, we also turn to our customers. Customer focus is extremely important
and customers view of Tryg is best monitored through the retention rates. For private
Denmark, we've seen as expected a drop in the retention rate as a consequence of a drop
in the Nordea portfolio. We are satisﬁed that we have a net positive impact when looking
at the Nordea and Danske Bank portfolio due to very strong sales to Danske Bank
customers, but the new sale does not impact the retention level.
Excluding Nordea, the retention rate was almost unchanged, but slightly impacted by the
high inﬂow of new customer for the last few years, which always have a higher churn in
the ﬁrst few years. In Norway, we are very satisﬁed that we continue to see high retention
even with high growth levels in the last few years. And for commercial, we saw a ﬂat
development for both Norway and Denmark.
And with that, over to you Barbara.

Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Johan. Let's have a look at the underlying claims ratio development
on Slide 15, where you should remember that this is excluding the impact of the COVID-19
claims.
The group underlying claims ratio improved by 80 bps compared to the same quarter last
year, while private was unchanged. Price adjustments and the claims excellence program
including claims synergies related to Alka are the main drivers behind the improvement,
but also a rebalancing of the portfolio towards more private business supports the overall
improvement for the group.
The growth in the private business has been very strong for many quarters now and as
expected, a strong growth with a modest negative -- will have a modest negative impact
on the underlying claims ratio as new customers in general have a frequency, which is
approximately 3% higher than the portfolio in general. We are very satisﬁed that the
initiatives in both commercial, but especially in corporate Norway, supports the improved
underlying claims ratio development and also the Danish and Swedish corporate book
demonstrate a strengthening proﬁtability due to price increases that Johan just
mentioned.
Please turn to Slide 16. Here we have updated the slide to provide the most recent
development in our core markets. The Nordic countries, especially Denmark and Norway

continues to do comparatively well during COVID-19 compared to more large European
countries. Lockdown and restrictions in the societies have been very diﬀerent around
Europe, so situations are diﬃcult to compare. Hopefully, the acceleration of vaccination
programs and the gradual reopening of societies will stabilize the situation. And to give
you some insights, so far 10% have started the vaccination program in Denmark and 4%
are now fully covered. It's slightly more Norway where almost 6% are done with the two
vaccines.
Please turn to Slide 17 for the ﬁnancial impact on our business. In Q1 '21, the total impact
from COVID-19 was a positive of DKK77 million primarily related to travel insurance with a
positive impact of DKK54 million as very few people were traveling and hence needed to
use their ordinary travel insurance. Lower motor frequencies also had a positive impact
albeit smaller. The comparable quarter last year was when COVID-19 broke out and
therefore, a very high amount of travel claims were recorded driving the overall very
negative impact.

Bloomberg Transcript

On Slide 18, we go through the details on the large and weather claims as well as the runoﬀs. In Q1 '21, the level of large claims was similar to Q1 '20, but both quarters were
slightly below a normalized level of around DKK140 million. Weather claims were almost
15% higher in the ﬁrst quarter '21 compared to the same quarter last year with weather
claims of DKK130 million, primarily due to frost in both Denmark and Norway.
In Norway, it was the coldest weather in January in the last 10 years and the very cold
weather led to a higher level of claims related to program [ph] grains. The discounting
impact was slightly lower in Q1 '21, compared to the same period last year due to the
lower interest rate level. The run-oﬀ was somewhat lower with 4.3% this quarter compared
to 6.4% in Q1 '20 and hence in line with a communication of run-oﬀ between 3% to 5%.
On Slide 19, you can see that the expense ratio for Q1 was 14.1%, which is ﬂat compared to
the same period last year. There's a strong focus on continuously ﬁnding eﬃciencies,
including a more eﬃcient distribution, which to a large degree contribute to ﬁnance the IT
investments. In this quarter, there was a slightly higher number of employees to support
the higher business volumes, as well as an increase in analytical competencies.
Please turn to Slide 21. At the end of the ﬁrst quarter, Tryg had total investments of
approximately DKK43 billion. This overview illustrates the usual split between the match
portfolio of just below DKK31 billion and the free portfolio of around DKK12 billion, but
overall the investment approach is unchanged.
If you then turn to Slide 22, you have more details on the actual investment results in Q1. A
positive result of DKK343 million beneﬁting from good returns on equities and narrowing
Nordic covered bond spreads. Tryg's equity portfolio was up approximately 8% in Q1 '21
versus a minus of 20% in the ﬁrst quarter of '20, a very large diﬀerence that drive almost
50% of the diﬀerence in the normal investment result in the quarter. More generally, the
free portfolio was impacted by good returns from equities as well as properties, while
increasing rates in the quarter hit the ﬁxed income returns. The match portfolio gained
from narrowing covered bond spreads.

FINAL

Furthermore, as Morten also mentioned, in this quarter Tryg reports a one-oﬀ gain of
DKK156 million related to a derivative contract -- a deal contingent forward, which we
have entered related to the acquisition of RSA. I'm sure you're all aware that the very large
diﬀerence versus comparable quarters in 2020 is driven by the outbreak of COVID-19 and
the huge impact it had on the macroeconomic and ﬁnancial markets in 2020.
On Slide 23, you can see that Tryg reported an unusually high solvency ratio of 899 at the
end of Q1, boosted by the recently completed rights issue of DKK37 billion, which will be
used to ﬁnance our part of the acquisition of RSA. Adjusted for the rights issue, we have a
more meaningful solvency ratio at 180 at the end of Q1. Own funds were as usual
impacted by proﬁts and dividends and of course by the aforementioned rights issue. The
SCR was approximately DKK300 million higher driven by an increase in the market risk
charge following the positive developments in the capital market in the quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

It's important to note that we expect the solvency ratio to be between 170 and 180 at the
end of Q2. This is based on an assumption that the acquisition is ﬁnally approved in Q2
and this also means that we expect the SCR to be at DKK9.8 billion at that time. Finally,
please note that we continue to expect a solvency ratio above 170 per year in '21 as we
have previously disclosed.
Please turn to Slide 24. Historically, we have shown Tryg's capacity in terms of additional
Tier 1 and Tier 2 instruments. Q1 is seen as a transitional quarter, meaning that the rights
issue has been concluded but the acquisition has not yet closed and hence does not yet
impact our balance sheet. Therefore, as per Q1, the current capacity clearly is only
temporary. We do expect to utilize most of our capacity based on expected own funds
and SCR at the end of Q2, taking into consideration the timeline for the closing of the
deal.
On Slide 25, we have shown you the main SCR components as in previous quarters. The
main point is that the increase in the SCR is driven by an increase in the market risk
following the positive equity markets development in the quarter. Looking at the overall
SCR is probably not a surprise that the non-life is the biggest charge. When looking at the
market risk, you can see that equities and spread risk are the ones with the higher capital
charge.
On Slide 26, we show the historical development of the solvency ratio. It's important to
highlight the predictability of the solvency ratio as own funds primarily are a function of
proﬁts and dividends, while the SCR is expected to be broadly stable by large movements
in the capital markets that we have experienced in recent times.
On Slide 27, you can see that the sensitivities are largely unchanged. Again, please note
the starting point of 899 issued to be impacted by the right issue and likely to be isolated
Q1 impact, assuming again that the acquisition closes in Q2. The main sensitivity relates to
spread risk and is unchanged due to the fact that Tryg holds a large amount of Nordic
covered bonds.
With this, I will hand over to Morten to give you an updated outlook.

Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Thank you, Barbara. And on Slide 28, we update our 2021 outlook. We still unchanged
expect the technical result between DKK3.3 billion and DKK3.7 billion, while we've
updated the investment result following a strong ﬁrst quarter. Regarding transaction costs,
it's important to note that approximately DKK700 million of the DKK1.6 billion to be
booked on the balance sheet have been booked in Q1 against shareholders' equity and
we still expect the full transaction to close in the second quarter and we will start equity
accounting from that point and until the demerger where actual consolidation can begin.
Then, of course, as always we ﬁnish oﬀ on Slide 29 with our favorite quote from John D.
Rockefeller.
And with that, we are ready to take your questions.

Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our ﬁrst question comes from the line of
Alexander Evans from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Alexander Evans

{BIO 19956412 <GO>}

Hi, everyone. Alex Evans from Credit Suisse. Thanks for taking my questions. If I just start
on private lines, so that the slowdown in underlying improvement there. I mean, how
should we think about this relative to the previous guidance? Because, obviously that was
50 bps and I don't know you said it's sort of below 50 bps. But you still got strong
premium growth fast. So I mean, should we expect a deterioration to come relatively
soon?
And then secondly, just on the Alka synergies, DKK28 million in the quarter, that's a little
bit below the sort of the run rate that we should expect given guidance. Is that a reﬂection
of the strong performance in 2019 and 2020 or is it perhaps expected to come through a
little bit later this year?
And then just premium growth in corporate has -- to have a positive trend in the last
couple of quarters. I'm just interested to hear what are sort of the main drivers here and
perhaps are you seeing less customer churn in Norway, or is it sort of a further increasing
in pricing? Thank you.

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Hi Alex, thank you very much for your questions. If I will start answering the question you
had on the underlying claims ratio, it is correct that it is the ﬁrst time that we report a ﬂat

development for the private. But I would also say that what you have seen over the last 12,
15 months is actually a move from 0.5 to 0.4 and in the last quarter, it was 0.2, which is a
very natural consequence of the high growth that we have experienced in the private
segment for a very long time now.
Bear in mind that new customers use their you can say insurances in more frequent and
usually we say that it has an impact of 3% more than the ordinary portfolio over time. So
this is more or less an expected development. So that is basically what we are seeing at
this point in time. We don't guide on future development, but bear in mind, this is in
natural consequence of the very high growth.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And then if I elaborate, you asked about the premium growth in corporate, you're right
that it is fairly positive this quarter, but I don't think that this means that we should expect
sort of generally stable growth in the corporate segment. And if we look beneath the
country about numbers, there's actually quite a lot of variation. So if we see the Danish
corporate lines, for instance, we see a growth this quarter of minus 4%. So at the moment,
we see a mixture of higher exceptions in the corporate Norway, which leads to higher
corporate growth reﬂecting the price growth, but actually still reduction in total exposure
and then that the actual -- the total growth in corporate Denmark including the price
increases is actually negative. So as a starting point, the price increases will pull up the
growth and then the lapse will pull down the growth and our own expectations is still that
the net of this will be slightly more volatile than retail and we are expecting it to be slightly
negative.

A - Johan Kirstein Brammer

{BIO 18640275 <GO>}

Yes. And maybe I should answer your question regarding the Alka synergies whether
they're sort of a little bit below what we should expect. I think the way to look at the Alka
synergies that we ﬁnished, we were supposed to ﬁnish in 2020, but synergies are of 150,
we were a bit ahead of time at that time and ended up at a DKK176 million. We still expect
to ﬁnish the year with full runway synergies of DKK300 million and we don't see any
delays or any risk around that number.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

And I guess, at the same time, we see that the performance of core Alka from an organic
point of view, which is equally interesting is clearly higher than expected. So all-in-all, Alka
is delivering very strongly.

Q - Mads Thinggaard

{BIO 15369662 <GO>}

Yes. Mads from ABG here. And thanks for taking my questions. I have kind of two
questions here. And going -- the one -- the ﬁrst is going back to the, I mean, underlying
claims and the acceleration you have overall driven helped by the price increases with 80
basis points drop in total underlying claims year-over-year. Is that kind of a new runway
we should expect throughout 2021 and that should contain some eﬀects that we have
seen from some of your peers on house insurance claims going up due to people staying
at home and detecting water damages. Is that an eﬀect that is also part of this underlying
drop that we see here in Q1 of 80 basis points?
And then secondly going through to your guidance and the COVID-19 claims, especially
on travel DKK54 million here in Q1. Is -- are those claims part of your guidance and I
mean, just the -- I mean, would you -- what is your expectations for Q2? I guess travel
claims could be quite good in Q2 as well. Is that something to take into considerations for
your technical result guidance for 2021? Thanks.

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi, Mads. Well, again, thank you for the relevant questions. If we start in the ﬁrst camp of
underlying claims development, I would say that we are absolutely positive about the
development that we have seen in the corporate segment delivering the strong
development. It is also supported by a positive development in the commercial segment.
But I think it's too early to say that this is going to be the new normal. I think obviously we
are very focused on the proﬁtability initiatives and we're happy to see as we also showed
in our presentation that the acceptance rate is relatively strong, but it's too early to say
whether that will be a continued level.
Regarding the eﬀect from house insurance claims, I would say that, that is not something
that has given us any positive impact in this quarter on the contrary. We see that in
particular in Norway, we have seen quite a lot of insurance claims not to water, but related
to frost in this particular quarter. So I would say we're very happy that we end here in Q1,
but I think it's too early to say that this will be a new normal.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I guess, we could add that when we look at the corporate business then not only
underlying is important, actually also the exposure to large claims is important. We saw
again in Q1 single very large claim out of corporate Denmark in the international portfolio,
Danish company, with factories in other countries. And that's a fairly good example of
exposure where the large claim risk is too high. And that's why in corporate, it's both price
increases, it is massaging the underlying downwards. We're pleased to see that
happening at the moment. But we further need to reduce the large claim exposure,
because that creates too much volatility in the corporate segment.
And then you also asked about COVID-19 and travel in the coming quarters. We saw that
travel was positive DKK54 million in Q1, a normal Q1 would have 40,000 travel claims and
in Q1 last year, it was 80,000 and Q1 this year, it was 12,000 and I guess now everyone is

FINAL

quite anxious to start traveling again. So being very clear on the predictability of this is not
very easy. So there's some degree of uncertainty to that.
But on the other hand the numbers are not really large enough to move the needle
materially compared to the total expected technical result for the year. So -- but we'll see
in the coming quarters, I think the summer will be interesting how many people will travel
and how many people have to cancel their travel or be called back again, that is a little bit
of a wild card for the summer, but the numbers are not really that large.

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

And if I can add also, because I think mostly Alka [ph] will be still reluctant to book the
travels, so compared to last year with this year, where most people had already booked
their summer holidays that's probably not the case for this year. But we'll have to see
Mads, I think all of us are pretty eager to get out there and see other parts of the world. So
--

Q - Mads Thinggaard

{BIO 15369662 <GO>}

Yes, sure, and thanks. And just to be shown on how you see this kinds, I mean, DKK100
million expected increase on the technical result than you would be expected to change
the guidance, is that correct?

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Sorry, you're asking on the DKK100 million where --

Q - Mads Thinggaard

{BIO 15369662 <GO>}

I mean, just to get, I mean when would you change the guidance. Is that more function of
time or is it just, I mean, assuming DKK100 million higher technical result for 2021, then
you would raise the guidance or when --

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

I think obviously when we have comfort that it's material enough, then we will reconsider
the guidance, but as a starting point, yes, we are ahead at this quarter, but as Morten was
saying, there's a large volatility related to large claims and we simply don't know yet what
will impact the score [ph] for the rest of the year.

A - Johan Kirstein Brammer

{BIO 18640275 <GO>}

And then honestly Mads, as we said last quarter as well, we see one year and full-year
guidance as an event only for this year and then after our Capital Markets Day and we will
also move returns to having three year targets as opposed to sort of very precise one year
guidance and we're not particularly fan of one year guidance to be honest. So we look
forward to that disappearing again.

{BIO 15369662 <GO>}

Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Asbjorn Mork from Danske Bank. Please
go ahead. Your line is open.

FINAL

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. It's Asbjorn Mork from Danske Bank here. Couple of questions from
my side. First, going back to the underlying claims ratio for 2021, Barbara, you said that
the 80 basis points is not what we should expect as a run rate going forward, but why isn't
that the case if I look at the synergies from Alka alone and on the good old truck before
RSA acquisition that I guess is 60, 70 basis points on your underlying claims ratio, the
synergies from that alone. And then I guess 10 basis points in underlying wouldn't be
unrealistic to assume. So why shouldn't 80 basis points be what we should expect for the
2021 versus 2020?

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

I think, as a starting point, the 0.8 is somewhat above what we have seen in previous
quarters and in particular, the fact that it stems from the corporate and commercial
business. Obviously, you're right around the other contribution and we are very aware of
that, but it's also coming down to how sustainable do we anticipate the development that
we have seen in particular in this quarter in the commercial and corporate space.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

And I would add Asbjorn that, there's always a lot of moving parts underneath and if we
look at for instance, the composition of private lines underlying, we see an improved
underlying and private line Denmark, but we actually see a slight deterioration in private
lines Norway, where particularly the house products in Norway is worse than anticipated.
And some of that can be explained with weather and some of it can be explained with
some changes and claims behavior.
But we do see a slight deterioration in private lines Norway. So that's why predicting
precisely from quarter-to-quarter, it is a little bit tricky with that many moving parts. But we
have a high ambition for underlying to continue to improve. I guess we're just trying to
signal that. It is not precise enough for us to say that 80 basis points is the precise number
every quarter and we would like to see that we get our hands around improving the
underlying in private lines Norway again.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

Okay. But that actually leads me to another question because on Norway, you say that or
you state that house insurance prices down 0.3% year-over-year, but then if I look at the
development on the slide, on the prices, it's mainly actually due to the fact that Q1 -- sorry,
Q2 last year had a price drop. And I guess if you look sort of year-over-year trends, they
will start to turn quite benign in the next couple of quarters. So wouldn't that sort of solve
this issue for Norway?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

It will help the issue, but I think it points to two issues, I think it points to one that
sometimes the agreement with a partner on pricing is reﬂective of historical performance.
Then we change a price like, we did with this one major partner Norway, but actually,
while we do that and there's an upwards trend on claims on house. So it's in a sense the
risk of a little bit stop go that we would use likely in a period where the claims actually
increased in house Norway, of course, that's not meaningful. So I think we need to try to
capture that in a more up-to-date manner and what sort of less stop-go.
And then I think also that the underlying claims trends in house Norway is slightly more
than that and we need to make sure that we handle that well, which of course, we are all
on board doing and we will handle that. So a little bit of timing and a little bit of house
claims in Norway that we need to handle and those are important.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

Okay. That's clear. Then on the commercial and corporate, we're looking at premium
development here. And then especially the comment you had Morten on the expect -- the
4% negative growth through corporate premiums in Denmark in Q1. Is there any impact
from the customer bonus from your owners being able to 5%? Does that have any impact
in terms of the acceptance that we see from the corporate and I guess to some
commercial space for accepting price hikes?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

No, actually I think that's a good question and we were ourselves a little bit uncertain as to
how that would play out. We were quite conﬁdent that private and SME customers
wouldn't react and a little bit unsure in the corporate segment and also a little bit unsure
in the broker channel particularly. But I think, our communication has been very good.
We've had good dialogues with the brokers. We had good dialogue with the corporate
customers and we've had virtually no negative reaction. So that we actually saw that a lot
of the customers said given that this is a year with a very sizable, I will say Scandinavia
transaction, that is very positive that there was a bonus paid anyway and virtually no
negative reactions to the 5%.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

Okay. Fair enough. Then on Sweden, normally I guess we don't talk too much about
Sweden, but I guess that will change quite soon, but if we look at the premium growth in
Q1, 1.2% so clearly the one of the areas you're not growing in and your statements, private
adjustments and partner agreements. So what is not delivering at the moment in
Sweden? I guess it's a little bit becoming a big point now that we only take (inaudible). So
what is it that, that you believe will change fundamentally from I guess, already from Q3?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

So I think we will hopefully talk a lot more about Sweden going forward and also a very
diﬀerent Sweden business. As you may recall if we go back one year, we saw that the
combined range when Sweden was too high. We saw in Q1 last year that we were sort of
very close to 100% in combined ratio and we are signiﬁcantly better in Q1 this year. We

FINAL

saw for instance last year that pricing on Norje, Sweden was not high enough compared
to the claims development. And therefore, we've had a task to increase prices very
signiﬁcantly in the motor segment in Sweden and also to reduce some of the exposure in
motor in Sweden.
And what we see is that we almost doubled our insurance technical results compared to
ﬁrst quarter last year. So the focus had not been on growth. It has been on price increases
and as a result of that, we've seen more of a customer lapse. And I guess you can see that
also when we move into the corporate segment where are we in general are increasing
prices quite signiﬁcantly, but actually Sweden take the highest goal and our change of
prices in corporate Sweden and Q1 on average was 21% increase.
So I think, we're actually very pleased that proﬁtability is improving in our own Swedish
book and we have expected a lower Swedish growth and then in the autumn, we'll start
debating the new and much bigger Swedish business and how we manage both strong
earnings and gradually to improve and increase also the Tryg growth in Sweden with
more innovation and more new products. That's probably more than a quarter. It will take
a while, but that's a more important long-term journey.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Johan Kirstein Brammer

{BIO 18640275 <GO>}

And Morten, if I could just add one thing that the focus on pricing and the customer lapse
that comes as a consequence of that. There are actually commercial activities oﬀsetting
that also in the personal lines business. So our Swedish Moderna business has very strong
niche brands, Bil sport, MC and Atlantica and they are actually doing very well in the time
of corona where people are spending more time on their boats and on their special costs.
So our niche brands in the Moderna business are doing very well oﬀsetting some of the
price initiatives that are creating customer lapses.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

All right. Thanks. And then ﬁnal question from my side on the retention. You mentioned
that your retention would have been 91.1 excluding the Nordea, the lost customers from
Nordea. Is it fair to assume that, that diﬀerence the 89.9 you have in the 91.1, 1.2
percentage points. If I sort of do the backwards calculation, it means that taking one out
of eight customers that leave you to Denmark, meaning that it doesn't seem to be that big
of a trend to your private portfolios. Is that a fair math?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I don't think we've published that number, but it sounds like you're basically just
calculating backwards out of the total lapse, how much is that diﬀerent? So I think that
sounds roughly right. So I guess it's -- I agree with you that fundamentally it's not a big
driver. But of course, it's diﬀerent for the short period where we had both Nordea and
Danske selling for us and no lapse. So now we have a very strong Danske selling for us.
We're now up to 35,000 new customers with Danske, which is really strong.
And of course, you cannot see that in the lapse ratio, you can only see the Nordea
customer leaving, but you're right that it is not a major challenge, but of course it does

have a net-net impact to retention rate and that's why we try to specify that so that we can
follow it. Another impact is of course that there are some customers who take out their
travel insurance. We also see that the sale of new travel insurance is down 35% compared
to last year. We know that it will pick up again, but it does have some impact both on the
lapse ratio and it also has some impact on the new sales that new sales of travel is 35%
lower and there is some lapse of existing customers on travel as well.

Jakob Brink from Nordea. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Thank you, and good morning. I actually would like to start on something which is not
speciﬁcally related to the quarter of the transaction. But looking around in the Nordics, it
seems like inﬂation is picking up, especially on everything that has to do with building
materials and getting things done. Is that something you're experiencing? I'm thinking it's
been quite a while since we've seen this level of inﬂation. Is this something you've seen in
the repair costs and how you preparing for that, is it possible to price up in advance? And
what exactly is going on? Thank you.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I think that's a very good question, Jakob. I think, traditionally and historically, we made
sort of fairly high level macro assumptions on what would be repair cost inﬂation. And I
think, 2, 2.5 years ago or so, it became quite clear that, that was simply through macro
way of looking at it. And since then we are on a monthly basis monitoring typically with
our procurement staﬀ, who monitors every single repair and every single repair contract
and see is the mix between the underlying inﬂation in craftsman salary, the underlying
inﬂation in actual material, and then typically the reduction of inﬂation that happens
because of our contracts and the deals we get in that and then they use those trends to
try to get ahead of the curve as much as humanly possible and feed that back to our
pricing people, straight away on a very continuous basis instead of sort of macro once per
year.
I think in that we've been worried about the salary costs for several years. So we've been
trying very hard to get ahead of the curve on that both with the pricing and also with the
contracts pushing the procurement contracts harder. And then we are seeing in several
areas and we've seen that for a while actually that also the materials have been increasing
in price. So yes, we do see it. While I don't think it's a very new phenomenon, I think we've
actually been working on that for more than a year, methodology wise more than two
years, but also adjusting the prices ongoing and trying to get ahead of the curve. So very
much a focus area, but not a new focus area for this quarter.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

FINAL

Thank you. Just one small follow-up. Do you have any sort of lag time? Is there any
contracts to which the craftsmen have sort of signed that they will keep doing whatever
kind of repairs for this net amount for let's say half a year or is it just instantly changing
when prices are changing?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well, typically, we can change it quite fast. There are contracts that are longer. There are
for instance, ﬁxed price contracts for various smaller repairs that run the risk that you're
pointing to, but honestly we're a big buyer and if we see major changes with all our
suppliers that we need to renegotiate and then we renegotiate. So typically that is
manageable there. There is some lapse but I wouldn't say that the lapse is large enough
to meaningfully disturb our capture of inﬂation.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Thank you. And then the second question in a bit more detail, but Barbara you
mentioned, DKK9.8 billion SCR in Q2. I guess that's correct. But the -- that's up DKK400
million since last time we -- you gave us an update. And you mentioned that this is
coming from market risk, but looking at the sort of progression of your equity portfolio
times 39%, 40% equity rate, which it is right now, that doesn't really give me that big of a
number. So where's it coming from?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Basically, I think what is missing in your calculations is the DKK400 million that we were up
at year end compared to the original DKK9.4 billion that we had at the time of the 2.7
announcement, because at that time we had seen also a -- you can say, additional charge
of DKK400 million in that time frame. So basically agree to the DKK300 million that we
just talked about related to this quarter, but I think what you're missing out is the DKK400
million that we had increased at year end compared to the 2.7 announcement.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

That actually mean compared to the updated number but okay, I guess we can take that
later. And the dividend of DKK1.07, I guess that I have one sort of unclarity left here on
going forward. So DKK1.07 for every quarter this year. Going forward, how to use -- or
what do you think in relation to ordinary and extraordinary dividends? Is it the same as
we've seen historically? And the payout ratio will that be based on reported net proﬁt or
where we start looking more at adjusted proﬁt given the larger amortizations or yes,
there's some clarity here would be nice. Thank you.

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

If I start by commenting, you can say the trajectory that we see ahead of us. Obviously, the
DKK1.07 is what we expect, as Morten explained to be the dividends in all quarters this
year. 2021 is a transitional year where you will have a lot of one-oﬀ items impacting the
ﬁnancial performance. So it is not to be seen as the base for the future. Taking into
account that we expect to be in a more normal future state in 2022 that is where we see a
Page 15 of 26



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2021-04-16

return to more normal dividend considerations. And obviously, as Morten was saying is
basically if you look at 2024 when doubling or expecting to double the technical result
that should also double the dividend capacity that we have. So that is that you can say it's
something that I think is -- it's fairly well iterated.

FINAL

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

And I guess, we will continually add up to have a view that we have an ordinary dividend
following a certain trajectory also giving the acquisition and then working with
extraordinary elements on top. And then of course, even when there is a sale potentially
of Codan, Denmark, then there is an event where of course looking at extraordinary
payout would make sense.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

And based on sort of the ordinary, will that be based on the payout ratio, which I know is
only second sort of requirement. But is that based on the reported proﬁt or adjusted
proﬁt?

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

That would be according to the adjusted proﬁt. Bear in mind, we will have signiﬁcant
intangibles impacting and so that would not make a reduction.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

And I guess the predictability and the trend of the total dividend has always been more
important to us than we pay out as a percent of earnings. So we have the 60% to 90%
target we've all been at the upper end of that. We've also actually been higher than that.
So really predictability of the total payout is more important than the actual payout ratio.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Thank you. That was all for me. Thanks a lot.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Per Gronborg from SEB. Please go
ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you. It's Per from SEB. Two questions from my side. The ﬁrst one, which is
(inaudible) clariﬁcation. DKK156 million gain on the DCF contract, will that after the
acquisition end up as a higher goodwill or will it end up as you're getting more equity in
the deal? I'm a bit surprised you're having hits accounting on this contract.

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Well, basically the way that you treat a deal contingent forward which this is, this is
obviously when we entered into the transaction that was at the prime or just before the
Page 16 of 26

FINAL

announcement of the 2.7. At that point in time, it's a fair value assessment because the -- it
has to be weighted according to the -- you can say likelihood of the transaction going
through.
Then at the time of the RSA AGM where the shareholders of RSA approved the deal then
obviously, it changed to hedge accounting. So very good timing dynamic which
somewhat changes over time and what you see during this particular quarter. So we are
actually using a hedge accounting for the time from you can say the approval of the
global RSA shareholders.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

But this also implies that the gains you have booked right now at DKK156 million that will
end up as a higher price you're paying compared to what you originally -- when you
originally did the --

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Yes. That's correct. And that's also --

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

So this should also -- DKK156 million higher goodwill after the deal closing.

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Correct.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Okay. Perfect. I just wanted to have those things. Then back to -(Multiple speakers)
Then back to Asbjorn question on the 0.8% underlying improvement, whether that's
sustainable. As Asbjorn also outlined the Alka should deliver some 60 basis points. My
question is corporate you gave some additional information at the Copenhagen
presentation after Q4 on the proﬁt initiatives taken under corporate book, material price
hikes or material probably needed to staying, how much should we expect this to leads to
the underlying combined ratio this year?
And besides that you have the guarantee business, which you some years ago -- it wasn't
due but the head of your guarantee business was telling us that they could run this at the
sustainable combined way to at around 60%, last year you were in the high 80s is aﬀected
in that, they're too normal and watch to see a normal for the guarantee business being
after last year where you suﬀered some larger losses.

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

Company Name: Tryg A/S

FINAL

I think, if we start with the guarantee business Per, it's absolutely correct that you could say
on a longer-term horizon, we see the combined ratio around the level of 60%. Obviously
right now, we have a macroeconomic scenario where we do have an impact also on the
guarantee business. Obviously, we're quite happy that we haven't seen more coming
through than what we potentially had expected when the COVID-19 broke out.
So I think basically we are obviously monitoring this very closely in terms of defaults
amongst the customers we have. The business model is obviously that we have really
insurance in place for the majority of the exposure we have. So over time, you should not
expect this to be a new level of combined. But obviously right now you have a
macroeconomic scenario where you couldn't even expect that it would be around 100s,
but that is not the case.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I guess in the typical run rate, which will also be the future run rate Per of 60% which
believe historical data clearly supports that is a major negative component of reinsurance,
which basically means that we overpay for reinsurance in most of the normal years, which
is included in those years combined ratio of 60%, which then beneﬁts us in the macro -the more challenged macro periods, which typically allows us to stay below 100%, but
fairly higher than the 60% in those years.
So actually the real underlying combined in a typical year is actually substantially below
60%, but then we overpay for reinsurance taking the total to roughly 60%. So nothing
changed there. And then of course, we continue with the gradual growth. We see now
that the outside Nordics exposure is now up to some 10% and the vast majority of that is
Germany. So it is still a very gradual and slow climbing up with international exposure,
which is working really well, but in a gradual and slow or planned process.
I think as far as the -- our consumers use and underlying is concerned, I'm not sure, I
didn't redo your math, but bear in mind that some of the synergies in Alka is claims and
some of the synergies are costs and some of the synergies are revenue. So I'm not sure, if
you did the math correct and only truth the component that was claims. So just to make
sure, you make that distinction right, when you try to do that calculation.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Back to the guarantee business, what I actually asked about was whether there were any,
if you state that the improvement should be less than 0.8% for the full year the underlying
improvement. What does that imply with the guarantee business that will continue at the - close to 90% level combined ratio also for this year?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Yes, we are saying that with the sort of elevate with macroeconomic risk, we expect a high
-- still continued high full year combined ratio for the guarantee business. That's correct.

Page 18 of 26



Company Name: Tryg A/S

Okay. What about corporate business where you have -- are taking signiﬁcant pricing
initiatives now for the third year in a row, what should we expect of underlying
improvement for that business?

FINAL

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

We see very clearly a strong improvement to the underlying development in the
corporate Norway business. And when you look at the smaller claims percentages alone,
you can see that -- but actually still the commercial and corporate or the mid-sized claims
and large claims still creates volatility. So when we look at the underlying improvements,
it's actually quite strong, but then we have this stochastic elements, which is just
completely diﬀerent to what you see in private lines and in the SME space.
I don't think we've published an expected underlying improvement on corporate, I don't
think we're going to do that either, but it's quite sizable. I think what Barbara said was
mainly that it is slightly more volatile than typically what we see in the private segments.
And I don't think we said that we couldn't deliver 80 basis points for the full year. I think
we said that, don't expect this to be a stable new level, because it is not that stable and
0.8 is higher than what we've usually delivered.

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

And it's too early to say whether that will be the new normal.

A - Johan Kirstein Brammer

{BIO 18640275 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

We're not saying, we'll not get there, but too early to promise that as a stable level there.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

I'm just a bit surprised on the corporate, I guess you have some large claims. But when
you look at the underlying trends, you have removed the large claims. Of course, there
are probably still more volatility in the corporate business and in the other parts, justiﬁed
that now we're in the third year with double-digit proﬁtability in new initiatives and you
are still not really willing to promise that we as -- that we should see clear improvement
contributing to the overall group improvement from the corporate business.

A - Johan Kirstein Brammer

{BIO 18640275 <GO>}

I think, that's a fair pushback Pierre. And then I think honestly, we're used to most of the
underlying improvement coming from the retail segment, where you have a ton of data,
you have a lot of predictability and you can see exactly what's going to happen and their
corporate is just a completely diﬀerent animal and really those two customers look like
each other but you're right that when we exclude the larger claims, we will see the
underlying improvement.
I think you probably just hear us being less bold in an area where data is a lot more tricky
than in the retail segment. So, we have zero doubts that the underlying and corporate is
improving because we are pushing through a price increases that is very sizable, we are
reducing the large claim exposure, et cetera, but at the same time working with
Page 19 of 26



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity

underlying as a concept in corporate lines is just data wise a lot more tricky than working
with the same concept in retail, of course.

FINAL

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Just an additional fact that it's not all corporate customers that have an annual renewal.
Some of the contracts are three years renewal processes, so you can say in that respect it
might be that we have some customers that we adjusted for three years ago, but that was
not enough so to speak. So it's important to bear in mind that it's not an annual renewal of
the full corporate portfolio, but you will see this coming in gradually over time.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

But again, it's the third year in a row that you are taking these initiatives.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Yes, absolutely.

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Yes, absolutely. But you can also say that we have become more bold in what we adjust
for now that we did in the ﬁrst year so to speak.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

So no doubt here about the trend, no doubt that it is positive, it will continue to be
positive. I guess, we're just saying be cautious on the precision and the predictability
that's the only thing we're saying.

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

Good morning. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Firstly, just returning to
guarantee, what's your latest expectation for how the guarantee business will perform as
the ﬁnancial aid package is removed? I think, you're saying because high-80s call this
year, and then maybe returning to the long run kind of 60% level next year or you think
you can drag into 2022 as well? And then just kind of how is your exposure in reinsurance
coverage for guarantee changed since it is started last year? Thanks.

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Well, thank you very much for that question. I think as a starting point, obviously we
see that macroeconomic expectations are turning, so you start seeing signiﬁcantly more
positive growth expectations for the coming years and what we were looking at just three,
four months ago. But I think it's very important to bear in mind that corona is not or
COVID-19 is not done. It will be a macroeconomic environment that probably will see
some swings back and forth until we are all and you can say immune globally.
And that will obviously have an impact on the timing and the length of you can say, the
current environment that we're in right now. Obviously, the packages have been a large
support during 2020, where we have actually seen best defaults than usual in the
customers that we are dealing with. But in general we see things coming back to more
normal levels now and obviously, with a growth expectations that is back to prevail. We
can be hopeful that, that will be the way that the world develops from here, but just don't
know yet.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

And I would say on the insurance, we have a combination of risk-attaching program for
the proportional and then risk occurring that it typically the access program. So that's a
diﬀerent period cover combination and the reinsurance. But I think, I would say overall
that we've never actually had any challenges placing our guarantee reinsurance. And the
simple reason is that over time the reinsurers make a substantial amount of money on our
reinsurance programs. And the fact that we buy overly high amounts of reinsurance in all
of the good years which allows them to have a very handsome proﬁts means that they are
much less aggressive towards us when we see the periods where macro is more
challenged. So we're not worried about reinsurance on guarantee, not at all.

Q - John Dillon

{BIO 4762287 <GO>}

Thank you. And you obviously had very few travel claims this quarter, what's happened to
your travel policy count and premiums in Denmark and Norway?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

What we can say is that, so there's an impact on existing portfolio of travel policies and
then there's an impact on new sales of travel policies. New sales of travel policies is down
35%, of course, it's a fairly small product, but still 35% does make a diﬀerence. So, we see
sort of in Denmark for instance 1 million to 2 million a week less in sales of new travel
insurance. We're quite conﬁdent that we'll increase again over the coming quarters, but
that's where we are now. We see less lapse of the current travel customers and those
people keep it, but we do see a lapse that is measurable.

Hi, there. Two questions from me. You mentioned, an extraordinary dividend potential
sale of Denmark further down the line and could the buyback also be in the table given

around 50%? And the second question, are there any comment you can give us
regarding the progress on the regulatory (inaudible) in U.K. if everything is going

Yes. We can certainly give you insights on that. Regarding your questions on the
dividends as we mentioned extraordinary dividends is one scenario, share buybacks is
other scenario. And as you point out that would probably be more helpful with respect to
the position of the foundation. So obviously we will come back with more details on that
as it becomes relevant. Regarding the progress on the regulatory approvals, I think we are
very comfortable with where we are right now. As mentioned, we are in place with the
antitrust approvals that are needed. So both in Canada, Denmark, Sweden and Norway,
we have got the approvals in place.
And what we are waiting for is, you can see the regulators approvals in a number of
countries. Bear in mind, this is a global deal. So we need to have the approvals in place
across the global activities of RSA today. In fact we obviously, have the dialogue with the
PRA and that is also moving ahead according to plan. So for now, we are very comfortable
that we should be able to see a closing within Q2.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

And then I guess the most unusual component of the structure was really antitrust in
Denmark and the splitting of Codan, Denmark 50/50. So really pleased that we got that
approval in place. We always felt that it should be improved -- approved. But at the same
time, we also knew that the structure was a bit unusual so really happy that that's in place.

Q - Daryl Goh

{BIO 4258857 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone. This is Daryl from Citigroup. I hope you are well. Just few
questions, please. So the ﬁrst one is just around the strong growth in private. Just if I hear
correctly, what are the new product areas that you've recently expanded in Q and kind of
Page 22 of 26

what is the outlook that I think you've referenced in the presentation where you seem to
be doing really well in dental insurance any more details around the new product lines
would be quite interesting? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you to you as well. I think really we're seeing a several new areas and let me
just give you a couple of examples, we saw for instance that dental insurance, which was
new to Tryg has now doubled and Tryg Classic, we're selling up to 2,000 new policies a
month now. We actually took that business to Alka, just by the year end and we've sold
15,000 new policies now on dental insurance in three months. So that's really very high.

Bloomberg Transcript

We also saw that when we go to Norway, it's quite normal that people have health
insurance through their workplace. But then bunch of people do not have any health
insurance. We've added now a new simpler slimmer version of health insurance to
individuals in Norway and that is not covered by their workplace. Then we've created a
number of new products with neutral the engineers in Norway, for instance, how they can
increase safety in their winter cabins and summer houses and how they can monitor heat
and water and things in their houses through that.
And then we created a new travel insurance where we try to take some of the things that
people were not covered for in corona and make that more standard in future travel
insurances. So if the travel agent goes bankrupt if the plane is delayed, we try to include
now vaccines and the new travel products medical hotline when you're out traveling, et
cetera. So I think we have a very good pipeline of more products. Sometimes it's just
taking existing new products to all of the partner agreements and all of the countries and
all the segments and sometimes it's actually adding new products. And our view is that,
that is continuing and also that the claims prevention component is continuing.
So we see for instance now, it's been a while since we launched for instance, alarms in
Denmark, but is really picking up and volume. So now we see that every third time we sell
a constant insurance in Denmark, customers choose an alarm as well. That's the highest it
has ever been. We see now that every second time we sell house insurance, people
choose a rat blocker, rats are disgusting, but are actually selling it as part of insurance, it's
very good. So I think we have a very strong pipeline both brought in what we have and
adding new products and we see that continuing as part of growing the top-line and the
bottom line more than the market.

Q - Daryl Goh

{BIO 4258857 <GO>}

Great. Thank you. And just one last question for you. Just how much visibility do you have
on RSA's performance in the ﬁrst quarter and if any comments that you can share on that
please? Thank you.

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Yes, sorry, we will have to wait with that till we get the keys. So we can't provide any
insight from that at this particular time.

Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Okay. So the next question comes from the line of
Youdish Chicooree. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone. Hope you're all well. I'm good. Just a few questions left. The
ﬁrst question is really on your private segment and the growth you're already seeing at
the moment. Can you help us understand how the 8% split between price increases and
volume growth? And then secondly, on the corporate, it's more a clariﬁcation. I think you
grew 4%, but I think in your commentary at the beginning, you mentioned that your
guidance is still like a basically a premium contraction, is that correctly understood?
And then ﬁnally on the RSA acquisition, I mean, if the transaction closes by the second
quarter of this year, and the demerger happens as planned in the ﬁrst quarter of next
year. I mean, during period do you have full operational control of the businesses? And
can you start extracting or realizing synergies in that period? Those are my three
questions. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Well, thank you very much, Youdish. I think, if we look at the corporate contraction that
you were asking about I think it's an absolute fair assumption in this particular quarter as
mentioned. We have seen a slight growth in particular in Norway. Some of that has also
been related to you can say one-oﬀ price adjustments and in Denmark as mentioned you
saw a negative development of around 4%.
So I think in general you should expect that to see a ﬂat development. We certainly don't
pursue a massive growth for us, it's a focus on the proﬁtability. And also if you look at the
re-balancing of the overall portfolio of our company, what you have seen in recent years is
basically that you saw a corporate and commercial being more or less equal. And now
you see the commercial space being around 22% and the corporate space being around
17%, and so you see that in the overall numbers. So I think that's a trend you should
expect also to continue going forward.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

When it comes to the growth and the component of price, product and customer growth,
it is varying over time, if we take private lines Denmark, it is roughly a sort of 40% price
30%-30% [ph] on customer increase and product increase. I think the biggest volatility
has come from private lines Norway where in 2020 there were two competitors that
almost went fairly up and a lot of customers searching for a new insurer. So last year, the
component of new customers was overly large in private Norway. We actually grew by
24,000 customers in private Norway and then peak our growth was 12%. If you look at the
Q1 this year, we're returning to something more normal where the growth in the number

of customers in private Norway is 2,200 customers in a quarter which is of course a much
more sustainable level some 40% of what was last year. So that is roughly a -- that is the
story, there, Youdish, if that makes sense.

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

Thank you very much. And then on the RSA acquisition, please.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Yes. You asked about two things essentially, you asked about whether we're going to have
operational control over our assets that we will end up within Sweden and Norway and
also whether we can start meeting the synergies. And as for the operational control, we
will obtain operational control over our perimeter. There are of course going to be
limitations to that since we are at closing the Danish, the Swedish and the Norwegian
assets are sort of linked in once candy assets so they will be limitation as to how we
operate and execute our operational control, but we will have operational control.
And there will also of course the limitation as to what synergies we can start weeping, but
our build-up to the DKK900 million starts with having a gradual implementation of
synergies already this year and we still expect that to happen. So going back to some of
the initial questions we've had around the timeline, one of the beneﬁts of having a
timeline that still stands the time -- at a test of time. We gave back at the 2.7
announcement. That means we have time to prudently actually start analyzing and
planning for the execution of both the demerger, but also for the synergy harvesting. So
we are in good shape here and we still believe to have suﬃcient operation control and to
be able to execute on the synergies.

A - Johan Kirstein Brammer

{BIO 18640275 <GO>}

I think the simple version is that we can do most of what we would like to do operationally
and synergies wise, but there are things we cannot do. So for instance when we end up
data, we cannot access. So for instance when we want to change claims procurement
contracts for Sweden and Norway, we need to show that we don't have access to their
Danish procurement contracts. And today they are in the same IT systems. So there are
sort of work around some needs to be done to prove that we don't access any Danish
data.
We can also work with hiring and ﬁring from having the takeover in the summer. But for
instance, we cannot work with the labor unions and the labor contracts until after
demerger. So I think there's some degree of legal hoops there but the majority of what
we want to do, we can do, but there are some legal limitations until the demerger and we
know exactly what those are and we need to make sure that, that is abided by that will
make our life a little bit more tricky until the demerger, but we can do most of what we
want to do and that is all according to how we planned it.

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

And I think that's also if you go back to the guidance we gave on the phasing trajectory,
we have DKK60 million related to '21, acknowledging that would be this in between a
Page 25 of 26

time period where we would not be able to do all the things that we actually want to. But
from '22, where we will have the full access, et cetera, et cetera, then it ramps up
signiﬁcant to DKK350 million from the DKK60 million in this year.
