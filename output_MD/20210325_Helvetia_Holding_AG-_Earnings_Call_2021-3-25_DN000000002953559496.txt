Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Helvetia's Virtual Investor Conference. Topics of
today's event include the presentation of the full year results 2020, a summary of the
conclusion of the helvetia 20.20 strategy and an overview on the use strategy, helvetia
20.25. I would also like to welcome our host, Philipp Gmur, Group CEO of Helvetia; and
Annelis Luscher Hammerli, Group CFO of Helvetia.
During the following presentation, all participant lines are muted. After the presentation,
you will have the possibility to ask questions. (Operator Instructions) For your information,
I want to mention that this event will be recorded. I would now like to hand over to Philipp
Gmur. Philipp, please.

Philipp Gmur
Thank you, Susanne. Within the next 45 minutes, we would like to give you detailed
information on our business development and the key ﬁnancials of the reporting period.
Please let me start on Slide number 2. As Susanne just mentioned before, we go through
this agenda as follows, and I would like to go further to Slide number 3. Let me start with
some highlights of the 2020 ﬁnancial year. In doing so, I would like to start with three key
messages. First, Caser is a pearl and is paying oﬀ. Second, we proﬁtably grew our
business. And third, we successfully completed our strategy period helvetia 20.20.
Caser, I am very pleased to be able to tell you today, we delivered what we promised a
year ago when we announced the acquisition of Caser by the end of January 2020. A look
at Caser business development and its ﬁgures shows that the acquisition is paying oﬀ.
Annelis Luscher will give you more information on this in a moment, but this much
upfront. Together with Caser, we improved our market position in Spain, and we are now
ranking number eight in non-life. Despite the challenging market environment, which was

FINAL

strongly inﬂuenced by the COVID-19 crisis, Caser was able to grow its non-life and life risk
premiums well above markets. In the non-life business, Caser made a positive
contribution to the net combined ratio of our Group. This results from a good quality of
the non-life portfolio with almost no exposure to COVID-19.
Finally, thanks to the good technical performance, Caser made a substantial and very
pleasing pro rata contribution of CHF54 million to Group IFRS proﬁt. And also to the
Group dividend by strengthening operating cash production. Overall, we are very
pleased that our conﬁdence in Caser is -- has come true. Caser has, of course, driven our
growth in 2020, but nevertheless, in spite of a diﬃcult environment in 2020, we were able
to also organically increase our non-life business by more than 8% and as well in
Switzerland, in Europe and in specialty markets.
Finally, the IFRS proﬁt after tax of CHF282 million shows that after some one-oﬀ eﬀects in
the ﬁrst half of 2020, the second half of the year was running according to plan. Our core
business is and remains in good shape and is very robust.

Bloomberg Transcript

With the year 2020, our helvetia 20.20 strategy has also come to an end. We can look
back at the past strategy period with pride. We achieved our goals. In ﬁnancial terms, we
succeeded in growing proﬁtably, while maintaining our solid capitalization and
distributing a sustainable dividend.
For 2020, the Board of Directors will, therefore, propose to the Annual General Meeting
to distribute an unchanged dividend of CHF5 per share to our shareholders. This
corresponds to an attractive dividend yield of 5.4%. Before I hand over to Annelis for a
detailed view on the ﬁnancial performance, I would like to say some words on COVID-19.
The pandemic was and remains not only a concern for us, but also for our clients. It was
therefore important to support them whenever possible. We, therefore, pragmatically
implemented various measures. To give you some examples, last spring, we were waiving
payment reminders and dunning letters in Switzerland and reducing the rent for small
businesses and self-employed persons. In order to ensure the provision of customer
support at all times, we quickly adapted our structures to the new situation and switched
to remote work for most employees throughout the whole group.
Finally, to counteract the emerging shortage of apprenticeships in Switzerland, Helvetia
also created additional apprenticeships this summer. On the business side, the COVID-19
pandemic led to regular claims, mostly travel and assistance insurance. To those
customers in the gastronomy industry, we had concluded an epidemic insurance with
pandemic exclusion. We quickly oﬀer the settlement solution, which was accepted by
more than 95% of the aﬀected customers in Switzerland and by more than 55% in
Germany.
We have thus created security for all parties involved. In total, the impact of COVID-19
claims and the net combined ratio was moderate as we also beneﬁted from positive
lockdown eﬀects. Annelis will provide you with more details later on. Despite the pressure

on new business volume in some lines of business due to the pandemic, we were able to
demonstrate the strong growth in non-life in most countries, as mentioned before.
Finally, the COVID-19 crisis also changed customer behavior and gave a massive boost to
digitalization in particular. We are seeing this very clearly with our digital insurer Smile in
our home market. Smile is the leading online insurer in Switzerland and recorded very
pleasing growth in the past ﬁnancial year. The premium volume now amounts to
approximately CHF100 million, and I will come back to Smile later on in the second part of
my presentation.
With that, I would like to hand over to our Chief Financial Oﬃcer, Annelis Luscher, who is,
for the ﬁrst time, participating in this kind of analyst conference. She will provide you with
the most important information about the ﬁnancial ﬁgures. Annelis, please go ahead.

Thank you, Philipp. A warm welcome also from my side. Within the next 25 minutes, I will
give you more information on our ﬁnancial performance in the 2020 ﬁnancial year. Let's
start on Slide 6. Helvetia Group can look back on a good business development in the
second half of the 2020 ﬁnancial year. The ﬁrst six months of 2020 were strongly
characterized by the corona pandemic. Overall, Helvetia has been able to continue to
grow proﬁtably in a diﬃcult environment. The capitalization, including Caser, remains
strong and Helvetia is distributing an attractive dividend to its shareholders, unchanged
since last year, despite the corona crisis.
A quick look on the key performance indicators shows that Helvetia's core business is in a
good shape. I will give you a detailed information on the numbers later on. The business
volume increased by 4.5% to CHF9.7 billion. In line with its strategy Helvetia has expanded
the non-life business in all the country markets and in the area of specialty markets. In the
life business, investment-linked solutions increased signiﬁcantly in Europe. A big growth
driver in general was, of course, Caser. But regardless of Caser, Helvetia was able to
achieve signiﬁcant organic growth in non-life compared to the previous year. Sorry.
Thanks to the good business development in the second half of the year with solid
technical results in the non-life and life business, Helvetia generated an IFRS net proﬁt
after tax of CHF282 million. Caser also made a substantial proﬁt contribution here. The
Group net combined ratio of 94%, underpins the resilience and the high-quality of the
portfolio and was also additionally supported by Caser.
Worth mentioning is also the solid capitalization. As of January 1, 2021, Helvetia estimates
the SST to be around 190%. The deﬁnite SST ratio will be published on April 30, 2021,
together with Bericht uber die Finanzlage, the Swiss SFCR. Finally, the Board of Directors
will propose to the Annual General Meeting to distribute a dividend of CHF5 to the
shareholders. I will go into details later on.
On the next slide, I would like to provide you with additional information on the business
development of Caser. At the end of June 2020, Helvetia completed the acquisition of

FINAL

the Spanish insurance company, Caser and its ﬁnancing. Helvetia has reached a strategic
milestone. And as Philipp mentioned, advanced to market position eight in the Spanish
non-life business. In the past business year, Caser contributed CHF715 million pro rata.
That means for the six months, Caser has been consolidated in our P&L to the Group
business volume in life and non-life as well as CHF93 million fee and commission income.
Although Spain was severely aﬀected by the pandemic, Caser developed very
successfully in the past ﬁnancial year and achieved growth in the non-life business and in
risk premiums in the life business. That was signiﬁcantly above the market. Please note
that this growth statement is based on local GAAP and relates to the full year 2020. With
91%, the net combined ratio was also at a very good level. In the non-life business, Caser
recorded no material impact from COVID-19, which was heavily overcompensated by
positive lockdown eﬀects in motor and health.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let's turn to Caser's proﬁt contribution on Slide 8. Thanks to a solid technical
development, Caser made a substantial proﬁt contribution of CHF54 million to the
Group's IFRS result on a half year pro rata basis. However, as you can see on this slide,
Caser's proﬁt contribution was aﬀected by non-sustainable eﬀects.
On the one hand, positive lockdown eﬀects occurred in individual business lines, such as
motor business. On the other hand, there were negative eﬀects in the non-insurance
business due to the COVID-19 related lower occupancy rates in hospitals. Therefore, a
normalized proﬁt contribution from Caser would have been approximately CHF35 million
for the second half year. Resulting in a normalized proﬁt contribution on an annual basis
of approximately CHF70 million. In a nutshell, we are conﬁdent that Caser will make a
substantial proﬁt contribution to the Group's ﬁnancial statement in the future.
Slide 9 gives you an overview of the IFRS result after tax on the individual business units.
The IFRS result after tax in 2020 was CHF282 million versus CHF538 million a year ago.
The pandemic caused major distortions on the capital markets in the ﬁrst half of the year,
which weakened the investment result in the life and non-life business.
In the second half year, Helvetia, was able to participate in the upswing, partially
compensating the weak investment result of the ﬁrst half year. The underwriting results in
non-life was inﬂuenced by COVID-19 claims and higher costs due to projects. However,
thanks to the good quality and diversiﬁcation of the portfolio, the result also beneﬁted
from a favorable claims environment in general and lower claims frequencies due to
lockdown measures in individual lines of business. In addition, Caser made a notable
contribution to the non-life business areas result.
In life insurance, the decline in the investment result was largely compensated by lower
expenses for interest-related reserve strengthening and policyholder participation. In
addition, net income in life insurance was impacted by a one-time positive tax eﬀect,
resulting from the Swiss tax reform in the previous year that did not apply this year.
Overall, the technical results of the non-life and life business divisions remained at a solid
level in the 2020 ﬁnancial year.

FINAL

Finally, I want to mention that the new business in life also proved to be robust. The new
business margin stood at 2.6% and thus remains well above the helvetia 20.20 strategic
target. The interest margin in the life business was at 0.85% compared to 0.9% a year ago.
The main driver for the slight decline was Switzerland, where the direct yield showed a
stronger decline compared to the decline of the average technical rate. In Europe, by
contrast, the interest margin was above the previous year due to a positive eﬀect from the
acquisition of the Spanish insurance company, Caser.
The resilience of Helvetia's underlying business shows that the Group is very well
positioned for the future, also in a diﬃcult environment. The result in other activities
decreased compared to the previous year, mainly due to the impact of COVID-19 claims,
together with weather-related events in Italy on the Group reinsurance result. In addition,
ﬁnancing and the integration costs related to the acquisition of Caser also had an impact.

Bloomberg Transcript

With regard to reporting segments, Helvetia recorded a lower result in Switzerland
compared to the previous year in both the non-life and life business. This is mainly due to
lower investment results in both business areas and COVID-19 claims as well as project
costs in the non-life business. In addition, a one-time positive tax eﬀect resulting from the
Swiss tax reform in the previous year did not apply this year. Regardless of these
developments, the Swiss home market made a reliable and substantial contribution to the
Group's result.
The result of the Europe segment increased primarily due to the pleasing proﬁt
contribution from the acquisition of Caser. The non-life technical result, in particular,
developed positively in Europe. Helvetia beneﬁted from the good portfolio quality with
low exposure to COVID-19 claims in the country markets of Spain and Italy and positive
lockdown eﬀects in certain lines of business. The volatile capital markets had a noticeable
impact on the life business. On the other hand, this was reﬂected in lower expenses for
policyholder participation.
The Specialty Markets segment also reported lower investment income due to the stock
market collapse in the ﬁrst half of the year. The technical result fell slightly short of the
previous year, mainly due to COVID-19 claims and individual large claims in active
reinsurance with positive developments in specialty lines and France.
The result of the corporate segment decreased compared to the previous year, primarily
due to the impact of COVID-19 claims and an accumulation of weather-related events in
Italy, on Group reinsurance as well as transaction, ﬁnancing and integration costs in
connection with the acquisition of Caser.
I will continue with our growth in business volume on Slide 11. In 2020, Helvetia Group
generated a group business volume of CHF9.7 billion. On a currency-adjusted basis, this
represents an increase of 4.5%. Caser made a signiﬁcant contribution to this growth. In
addition, Helvetia's non-life business was a pleasingly strong growth driver with an
increase of 18.6% in local currency. In addition to the positive impact of the acquisitions of
Caser, Helvetia was able to grow signiﬁcantly, particularly in the specialty market segment,
which is due to positive price and volume eﬀects.

FINAL

The non-life business in Switzerland and in Europe also showed impressive growth rates
despite the crisis mainly in the property insurance business. In life, the business volume
with investment-linked products in individual life in Europe developed very well. The
Caser acquisition on the one hand and signiﬁcant growth in periodic premiums on the
other hand, contributed to this increase.
Helvetia made a strategic decision to introduce a new tariﬀ in the Swiss group life
business, as of January 1, 2020 to strengthen the future proﬁtability of Swiss group life.
This led to an expected signiﬁcant premium decline in this line of business in Switzerland
in the 2020 ﬁnancial year and as a result, life insurance in total recorded a currencyadjusted volume decline of 9.4% in 2020.
Let's move on to Slide 12. On Slide 12, you see that Helvetia now also reports the income
from fee and commission business. This amounts to CHF226 million, whereof a signiﬁcant
amount stems from Caser's non-insurance business.

Bloomberg Transcript

I would now like to move to the net combined ratio on Slide 13. In the 2020 ﬁnancial year,
the net combined ratio was at 94% and thus increased compared to the previous year.
Thanks to the good quality of the portfolio and the positive impact from the acquisition of
Caser, the ratio was very robust despite losses from COVID-19. The net claims burden from
COVID-19 due to regular claims from policyholders and from settlement solutions oﬀered
by Helvetia, particularly in Swiss epidemic insurance aﬀected the combined ratio by 2.3
percentage points. The relatively low impact is proving the resilience of the portfolio.
Helvetia additionally beneﬁted from a lower burden of major losses from natural
catastrophes and lower loss frequency in individual lines of business as a result of the
lockdown to combat the pandemic. The cost ratio increased to 31.4%. The reasons were a
higher administrative cost ratio, mainly driven by higher project costs as well as a slightly
higher acquisition cost ratio due to shifts in the business mix.
At 31.4%, Helvetia cost ratio is too high. Helvetia needs to become more eﬃcient in order
to secure its competitive position. Helvetia is achieving this by simplifying processes and
eliminating duplications. In this way, we can also reduce costs. For this reason, as part of
our new strategy, we are also addressing a cost eﬃciency program to leverage CHF100
million of cost eﬃciencies, while at the same time, continue to grow. Philipp will come
back to this as part of the strategy helvetia 20.25 later on.
On a segment level, in Switzerland, the net combined ratio was higher than in the
previous year. The reasons were a higher loss ratio due to COVID-19 related losses and
lower run oﬀ gains from reserves for claims from previous years. The latter are mainly
attributable to interest related reserve strengthening in the accident/health business and
to reserves running oﬀ from claims from whiplash injuries and for the portfolios of Alba
and Phenix acquired in 2010.
The positive development of the current year loss ratio, excluding COVID-19 claims and
the partially compensating eﬀect. The positive development was due to the good
portfolio quality in a favorable claims environment and low burden from major losses from
Page 6 of 22

natural events. In the Europe segment, the net combined ratio improved in the 2020
ﬁnancial year to 92.7%. The development is due to a positive inﬂuence of the acquisition
of Caser, a lower exposure to the country market, Spain and Italy to COVID-19 claims and
lower claim frequencies in individual lines during the lockdown periods. All European
market units achieved combined ratios below 100%. In the Specialty Markets segment,
the net combined ratio increased slightly to 97.5%. The claims ratio increased
predominantly due to COVID-19 losses and individual large claims in active reinsurance.
The cost ratio improved primarily due to growth related economies of scale.
Slide 14 shows the development of our investment result. At CHF889 million current
income from ﬁnancial investments and investment properties was below last year's level
mainly due to lower yields on reinvestments in the persistently low interest rate
environment. Current income continued to prove a stable backbone of the overall result.
The direct yield declined slightly compared to the previous year from 1.9% to 1.7%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Realized and book gains and losses amounted to minus CHF48 million and were below
the previous year, which was characterized by a strong performance on the equity
markets. In 2020, by contrast, COVID-19 caused a collapse in the equity markets, resulting
in losses on equities and derivatives in the ﬁrst half of the year. However, pricing equity
markets in second half of the year supported the sizable recovery of the investment result.
The investment performance, which, in addition to the current income and the changes in
value of the portfolio recognized in the income statement also includes the change in
unrealized gains and losses in equity closed clearly in positive territory at 2.7%.
The main driver for the investment performance were higher valuations for ﬁxed income
securities due to lower interest rates. As a result of the positive development of the capital
markets in the second half of 2020, income on investments with market risk for the
policyholder was at CHF186 million. I would like to ﬁnish my presentation with a slide
regarding the dividend proposal to the Annual General Meeting.
Helvetia pursues a dividend strategy that aims to pay sustainable dividends to its
shareholders. Sustainable in this context means that Helvetia wants to increase the
dividend from year-to-year, if possible, but at least keep it stable and not to reduce it. In
light of the challenging ﬁnancial year 2020, the Board of Directors will, therefore, propose
to the Annual General Meeting to keep the dividend stable. This allows us to yet, again,
conﬁrm our sustainable dividend strategy even in a diﬃcult year. The dividend yield
stands at 5.4%. Finally, I want to point out that Caser made a substantial contribution to
the Group's dividend.
On that note, I will hand over back to Philipp.

Philipp Gmur
Thank you, Annelis for all those details regarding the ﬁnancial year 2020. Let me just add
with regard to our dividends proposal. It shows that we believe in our business, and we
believe in a huge potential going forward. And I think that's well reﬂected in this dividend
proposal by the Board of Directors for the Annual General Meeting. Now in the last part of

FINAL

the presentation, I would like to give an overview on the successful completion of the
strategy 20.20 and then present the highlights of the new strategy, helvetia 20.25.
Let's start on Slide 17. I would like to begin with our starting position. Today, we are
Switzerland's leading insurer. In the segment Europe, comprising Germany, Italy, Austria
and Spain, Helvetia has ﬁrmly rooted market positions for generating above average
growth. Europe is the Group's second strong pillar. Helvetia stands for successful mergers
and acquisitions in our home market, Switzerland as well as in Europe.
Via the Specialty Markets segment, we have global market access in selected niches. In
this segment, Helvetia oﬀers tailor made specialty insurance and reinsurance cover [ph].
The market unit France acts as a focused transport insurance specialists -- specialist and
holds a strong market position as the number two in this sector.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let's go to Slide 18. Following the successful conclusion of the past strategy period, we
are well positioned for the future. We can look back at helvetia 20.20 with pride. With our
Swiss reliability, we achieved all the goals we had been setting. I would like to mention a
few highlights. Firstly, we successfully strengthened our core business. Milestones include
the integration of Nationale Suisse and Baloise Austria as well as, of course, the
acquisition of Caser in Spain. We further developed our customer access and oﬀering in
line with our customers' needs. For example, we expanded the bank distribution in
Europe and grew our B2B2C business and put our brand promise simple, clear Helvetia
into practice. We organically and proﬁtably grew our business.
Secondly, we developed new business models in the mobile sector with Smile, the
leading Swiss online insurer. I will come back to this later. With the home ecosystem built
around MoneyPark, we provide our Swiss customers with a continuous and complete
customer journey related to housing. The launch of the Helvetia Swiss property funds by
Helvetia Asset Management is also paying oﬀ for our strategy. All these initiatives are
strengthening our fee business, which makes us less dependent on the interest rate
environment.
And thirdly, we use targeted innovations on the one hand in the form of in-house
developments, such as the chatbot services. And on the other hand, via the investments
of our Helvetia Venture Fund. The venture fund has invested in numerous ﬁntech and
proptech companies. Furthermore, in Europe, for example, we provided innovative
solutions for best technical integration of distribution partners as well as dedicated
solutions for digital banking.
On Slide 19, I would like to say a few words about Smile. The insure tech [ph] Smile can
look back on a record year in 2020. Smile now has over 150,000 customers and the
premium volume of around CHF100 million, all with a good proﬁt. One of Smile success
factors is certainly its online strategy that it adopted early on, which was additionally
strengthened with the focus on mobile-ﬁrst and on a rigorous customer centricity last
year.

FINAL

Smile customers can thus conveniently manage their insurance policy online and via app
without an adviser and beneﬁt from a 24/7 digital service. An additional catalyst of the
Smile success story is, of course, COVID-19 a crisis, which is permanently changing
consumer behavior and also accelerates the digitalization of the insurance industry.
On the next slide, I would like to summarize the most important highlights of the
acquisition of Caser once again. I am really very pleased, together with the whole
management that we are able to dispel all doubts around the acquisition of Caser, and
that's by now, our conﬁdence comes true.
As we earlier heard from Annelis, the acquisition is deﬁnitely paying oﬀ and everything
goes according to plan. Helvetia will beneﬁt from Caser's know-how in bank distribution
across the Group. We expect Caser to continue to make a signiﬁcant contribution to proﬁt
and sustainability. And -- excuse me, please, we'll make Caser is -- we expect -- sorry, we
expect Caser to continue to make a signiﬁcant contribution to proﬁt and to the dividend
paid out to our shareholders.

Bloomberg Transcript

With Caser we also achieved our goal of signiﬁcantly improving our position in Spain, in
the Spanish market. And there, positioning Helvetia as a European ﬁnancial services
provider. Together, Helvetia and Caser are now ranking number eight in the non-life. And
overall, we are now in the top 10 of the Spanish market.
Let me move on to Slide number 21. In the helvetia 20.20 strategy period, we were able to
develop our segment Europe into the Group's strong second pillar. A signiﬁcant
milestone was, of course, the aforementioned acquisition of Caser. But even without
Caser, the European segment has been showing signiﬁcant growth since 2020 -- since
2015, with growth rates above market in all our European units. One growth driver was,
for example, the good progress we made in our digitalization eﬀorts. In Italy, for instance,
our sales activities are characterized by a fast partner integration capability and a high
level of user-friendliness.
According to Gartner, this makes Helvetia a reference case for successful bank
distribution. In Spain, we also rely on successful sales partnerships, such as with the Pont
Group in the area of motorbikes. In Austria, our online insurer, Smart, is enjoying
increasing popularity. At the same time, we enhanced our technical excellence via the
uniﬁed pricing methodology and product controlling approach, leading to an improved
portfolio management. Our eﬀorts are reﬂected in a signiﬁcantly improved combined
ratio.
Let's now take a look on the achievement of our ﬁnancial targets on Slide 22. In addition
to our strategic priorities, we also achieved our goal of generating proﬁtable growth,
while at the same time, maintaining our solid capitalization and distributing a sustainable
dividend. Even though the year 2020 was marked by the COVID-19 crisis, we successfully
fulﬁlled all ﬁnancial targets over the entire strategy period. We are thus building on a
healthy foundation and are well equipped for the future.

To summarize, thanks to the successful implementation of helvetia 20.20, we hold a top
position in Switzerland as an online insurer with Smile as the leading online insurance
company. Europe is our second strong pillar. And in Specialty Markets, we are successfully
playing in niches worldwide. With our broad distribution network, we enable our
customers to get access to our products through various distribution channels, and we
were, therefore, able to generate strong growth in all market units. The growing fee
business makes us less dependent on the interest rate environment and thus supports our
strong earnings quality characterized by a four-fold diversiﬁcation.
We want to continue on this successful path also in the future. Developing Helvetia from a
Swiss insurance company with a couple of operations abroad to a Swiss-based European
insurance player.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let's move on to Slide 24. With a history spanning more than 160 years, Helvetia has
come a long way, but our purpose remains the same and will continue to do so in the
future. Life is full of risks and opportunities, and we are there when it matters. In order to
continue to fulﬁll our purpose in the future, we want to be the best partner for ﬁnancial
security. Setting standards in convenience and in customer accessibility. As the best
partner for our customers, we closely listen to what they want and what they need. We put
the customer at the center.
And in our helvetia 20.25 strategy, we are, therefore, setting four strategic priorities. The
ﬁrst one, we want to be present wherever insurance and pension needs arise and provide
our services in the simplest way possible for our customers. Hence, we are relying, for
instance, on personalized customer targeting by using analytical tools and customer
segmentation. Furthermore, we are simplifying our processes, reducing complexity and
increasing eﬃciency. This contributes to a high level of customer satisfaction and
customer loyalty. As well as to the successful implementation of the brand promise,
simple. clear. helvetia. We are sure that we have a long way in front of us, but we want to
go this way.
The second strategic priority. We oﬀer comprehensive products and services in the area
of insurance as well as integral pension and investment solutions. This way, we are
optimizing risk-adjusted investment returns and generating additional fee income in asset
management. In addition, we enable successful cross-selling and give our customers the
opportunity to get their insurance and pension needs from a single source.
The third priority, in Switzerland, we aim to expand our existing customer relationships.
We will, therefore, continue our omnichannel approach and further expand and
strengthen new distribution channels such as B2B or B2B2C. We further developed the
European business as a strong second pillar of the Group by strengthening customer
access and service via our best partner approach and enhancing our oﬀering for small
and medium-sized enterprises. This will again result in above-market growth. In the
international specialty business, we generate targeted growth through further
development of our existing business and the underwriting of new risks in attractive
niches.

And ﬁnally, the fourth strategic period, we make use of new opportunities. We built new
business models and ecosystems in and around our core business as well as in the area of
asset management. Examples are our home ecosystem in Switzerland or the health and
care ecosystem in Spain. In the asset management division, we are expanding the thirdparty business. We also want to continue on the successful path of Smile. The aim of all
those initiatives is to oﬀer our customers innovative products and services. At the same
time, increasing the fee business shall make you -- shall make us less dependent on the
interest rate environment.
On Slide 26, you can see what we would like to achieve with those strategic priorities. We
are contributing to proﬁtable growth, sustainable proﬁtability and improved operational
eﬃciency. Furthermore, we ensure the ability to pay dividends also in the future. We are,
therefore, going to Slide 27, we are, therefore, setting forth the following ﬁnancial targets
until 2025. With regard to the quality of earnings and growth, we aim for a net combined
ratio of between 92% and 94% in the non-life business. In the life business, the target for
the new business margin is between 2% and 3%. Our aim is to generate a volume of more
than CHF350 million of fees, including our new business models and ecosystems, and the
share of fee business of our IFRS proﬁt should make up more than 5% by the end of 2025.

Bloomberg Transcript

An important component of our strategic priority, increasing customer convenience is to
simplify our processes, reduce complexity and to improve our operational eﬃciency. In
this way, we secure for future -- for our future competitive position. We want to use the
wide-ranging competencies of our Company even more eﬀectively. Therefore, we strive
for a balanced relationship between cost consciousness and quality demands. In order to
achieve this, we will realize cost eﬃciencies of CHF100 million by 2025.
Our solid capitalization should be reﬂected in a stable S&P A rating. And we want to
continue our sustainable dividend strategy. Our aim is to distribute more than CHF1.5
billion to our shareholders within the next ﬁve years. Finally, we strive for a return on
equity of between 8% to 11%. Adjustments are made to equity by excluding unrealized
gains and losses from equity.
On Slide 28, I would like to brieﬂy explain which prerequisites must be set in order to
successfully implement our strategy. It's all about people, partner and performance. What
does this mean in detail? Regarding people, we focus on talent management and
leadership. This means that we further develop our employees in a targeted manner and
gear our talent and succession management as well as our entrepreneurial understanding
of leadership towards the achievement of our strategic goals.
Second, with regard to our partners, we especially make use of the opportunities
presented by digitization. We modernize our technology and use data analytics in a
targeted manner to best connect with our customers and partners. And ﬁnally,
performance means that we want to always perform at the top level. We, therefore,
consequently measure ourselves by our results and demand technical excellence in the
areas of underwriting and the pricing of our product.

What does all that mean regarding our three segments? In Switzerland, we consolidate
our position as Switzerland's leading all lines insurer. We further develop Europe as a
second strong pillar in order to become a European ﬁnancial services provider. And in
specialty markets, we aim to achieve further proﬁtable growth in the international
specialty business. For example, in the aviation and space business, and the area of active
reinsurance.
At our Capital Markets Day on June 22, 2021 that means like in three months from now,
we will provide you with more detailed information regarding our strategy helvetia 20.25
including a deep type of Caser and speciﬁc initiatives around new business opportunities.
This brings us to the end of my presentation. Annelis Luscher and I would now be pleased
to answer your questions. Thank you for your attention.

Questions And Answers
A - Susanne Tengler

{BIO 18673192 <GO>}

Thank you, Philipp and Annelis for your presentation. We will now start the Q&A session.
(Operator Instructions) The ﬁrst question comes from Peter Eliot. Peter, please go ahead.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

You can hear me now?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Susanne Tengler

{BIO 18673192 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Yes. Sorry, for the hiccup. Thank you very much. I have three questions, please. So the ﬁrst
one was on the 3.9% of adverse runoﬀ development. I mean a lot of that is usually active
reinsurance eﬀect or the growth of that. I just want -- can you say how much of that is due
to the reinsurance eﬀect? And how much further we might expect that to go in the future?
The second question was on Caser. Just to check on my math, really. The CHF70 million is
before minorities and ﬁnancing costs, I think, so CHF40 million after those, which, I guess,
is sort of 7% of the 2019 earnings for a 7% increase in shares, which kind of looks EPS
neutral to me before integration costs. I'm sure I've missed something there and
something else, but I'm just wondering if you could sort of comment on my math there.
And the third one is on COVID-19 losses. So at the half year, I think you said CHF89 million
in the non-life segment. Now I think you're saying CHF97 million for the whole Group for
the full year. So I was wondering if you could just sort of clarify where the losses sit. It
sounds like only CHF8 million from active reinsurance, which just leaves me struggling a
little bit to understand that the active reinsurance results in light of that. And it would
maybe -- it would be great to understand the remaining risk, given that 45% of German
claims haven't settled yet and where you are on reinsurance recoveries. Thank you.

A - Philipp Gmur
Thank you, Peter, for those three questions. I would suggest that I start with the answering
of question number three and hand then over to Annelis for number one and two.
Regarding COVID-19 losses, it is as follows. The number we communicated with the half
year results of almost CHF90 million on a net basis, slightly increased by those CHF8
million, CHF9 million you just mentioned before. That means that in the second half of the
year, we did not have new claims. And this is a number on a net basis, which is true for the
whole Group, so to say, but we have in our books. And now I would like to hand over to
Annelis for the questions number one and two.

A - Annelis Luscher Hammerli

{BIO 21606790 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you. So the lower runoﬀ gains from reserves, this is mainly due to interest rate
related reserve strengthening in the accident and health business. And to reserves
running oﬀ for claims from whiplash injuries and for the portfolio of Alba and Phenix
acquired in 2010. So that was to the ﬁrst question.
The second question on EPS accretive the acquisition of Caser. So yes, the acquisition of
Caser is EPS accretive. And I would suggest that for the details, to this calculation, you
approach our Investors Relations team later on.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

That's great. Thank you very much. Could I maybe just quickly follow-up on the sort of
second part to the -- for the last question. Sorry, stepping in for that. But the German
claims, I mean you said you had 55% settlement. What's the sort of position with the other
45%, can you able to shed any light on that process at all or what we expect there?

A - Philipp Gmur
Okay. Thank you for this question. In Switzerland, we have a ratio of more than 95% of our
clients who accepted our proposal. Whereas in Germany, it's only 55%. Now what
happens with the 55%, they accepted our proposal getting a certain sum and at the same
time, excluding the pandemic risk for the future. Whereas the remaining 45% did not
accept our proposal. They go either to court and/or want to have a contract, which is in
force for a longer period.
Now what does that mean? We have up to now a couple of leading proceedings going
on. There were -- if I recall it the right way, we -- there were four or ﬁve legal proceedings,
which have been dealt with before a court up to now. We were winning three out of four.
There were a couple of legal proceedings, which ended up with an agreement between
the parties.
And those legal proceedings, which were either in favor of Helvetia or one of them was
against Helvetia, their -- they will go to a second court in Germany. But that's only a
couple of legal proceedings up to now. And there might come more. However, that
means that the contracts are still in force. But you have a coverage period of like one
month, two months, three months. So we exactly know what our risk exposure is. And we
made provisions in our 2020 results. So there is no bad surprise coming out of there.

The second question is coming from Rene Locher. I'll unmute your line and then you can

Q - Rene Locher

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay, wonderful. Good morning, all. So I would like to start with this cumulative dividend
distribution. In the last ﬁve years, you achieved CHF1.19 billion, and now you are targeting
an at least 26% higher cumulative dividend distribution to above CHF1.5 billion. My
question is which business units or which countries do contribute to the 26% increase?
That's the ﬁrst question.
And then a quick one on combined ratio, analysts are also a little bit ambitious. When I
take that 94% reported combined ratio and I deduct 2.3 percentage point, call it 19, then I
end up at 91.7% for 2020. You target for the next strategy period stands at 92% to 94%. So
when I compare the adjusted 2020 combined ratio with the new target, it doesn't look so
ambitious to me.
Then a third question, if I may. Just on the Swiss business, I mean, Swiss business was
always very, very strong. And now when I take a look at the Swiss combined ratio, cost
ratio is up by 300 basis points year-over-year and over the claims ratio, so perhaps we're
on 60 basis points. And you explained to us, there are a lot of one-oﬀs in there like project
cost. But I'm just wondering, if you can elaborate a little bit on the Swiss non-life business.
Then when I'm looking at the Swiss life business, here the gross margin also decreased by
I guess, a few bps and Annelis explained that, that's due to the lower reinvestment yields,
but here, again, just the (inaudible) the Swiss, where the domestic life business is going?
And yeah, perhaps quickly on the cost was the eﬃciency, very interesting to see that
Annelis highlighted the CHF100 million when she was talking about the non-life business.
So I'm wondering a bit taking of this CHF100 million more or less in the non-life business?
Thank you.

A - Philipp Gmur
Okay. Rene, if I count it the right way, you have like ﬁve diﬀerent questions.

Sorry.

FINAL

A - Philipp Gmur
The ﬁrst is about the dividends. The second about the combined ratio ambition. The third
one about our Swiss combined ratio, speciﬁcally, the fourth about the gross margin in life,
and the ﬁfth question deals with our eﬃciency program. We go ahead as follows. I am
answering question number two, and I then hand over to Annelis for the answering of the
other questions and might maybe add some more -- one or more comments.
Let's go to question number two, is it ambitious enough to set forth a combined ratio
target of between 92% and 94%. As you well know, we are sticking to our targets and
sticking to our promise. And we want to set forth targets we can achieve, of course. And if
we are looking at our business mix in the diﬀerent country markets, if we are looking at
our business mix in the diﬀerent business lines, if we are looking at what's going on
around us with regard to pricing, et cetera, we think that it is ambitious enough to set
forth this target range.
Of course, we happily take 91%, and we are working on an even better combined ratio.
But historically, we think that this target range is still ambitious enough. And if we could
underwrite it today for the next ﬁve years, we would like to take it. Now I hand over to
Annelis for the answering of the other questions.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Annelis Luscher Hammerli

{BIO 21606790 <GO>}

Yeah, thank you, Philipp. I can maybe add, Rene, to your calculation of the CHF94 million,
minus the 2.3%. What is -- why should we maybe enhance this calculation? So the 2.3%
was the net claims ratio out of COVID-19 claims. However, importantly, we also had
positive lockdown eﬀects, especially in -- also in Southern Europe. So they are on the
positive side of this net combined ratio of 94%, and they are also a special case for this
COVID year. So -- yeah. so the calculation has to be enhanced a little bit.
On your ﬁrst question on the cumulative dividend distribution, which we plan to increase
from currently CHF1.19 billion for the last ﬁve years to CHF1.5 billion for the next ﬁve years.
This stems from growth in all our markets. So what do I mean by this is that my focus
especially is to have a very close eye on proﬁtability of the business and on growth. So on
proﬁtable growth and by taking advantage also like we already reported in the Specialty
Markets business oﬀer scale eﬀects. We are able to pay out more dividend in the next ﬁve
years due to the planned growth proﬁtable growth.
I would now go to the third point on the Swiss business and the cost ratio. There the cost
ratio was inﬂuenced by various eﬀects, but also by a large part also by project costs, which
make a big part there of the increase in costs. And on the cost eﬃciency.
So this was your ﬁfth point, if I recall it correctly, this is not only a topic of non-life. This is a
topic of -- for general for Helvetia. So it will impact of course the cost ratio in non-life, but
it will also increase the cost eﬃciency in the life business.

The fourth question, I'm afraid I did not write it down correctly, and I don't remember.
Could you please repeat that?

A - Philipp Gmur

FINAL

It's about the gross -- the development of the gross margin in life, isn't it Rene?

A - Susanne Tengler

{BIO 18673192 <GO>}

But I don't see Rene any longer. I think we have a technical problem. Okay.

A - Philipp Gmur
I can maybe add until Rene comes back with regard to the dividend policy. If you have a
look at Caser only, it contributed to the cash production of Helvetia within the ﬁrst ﬁve -within the ﬁrst six months, roughly CHF25 million, CHF26 million. So there is a lot more
dividend coming out from Spain already. And of course, as Annelis mentioned from the
other segments as well.
Now Rene Locher, coming back to your question regarding the gross margin in life. Can
you hear me?

{BIO 21606790 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes. So we show that our gross margin in life was inﬂuenced also by the lower
reinvestment yield, especially due to lower rates. Regarding the life, the Swiss life
business, we have introduced a new tariﬀ as of January 1, 2020, which will majorly
improve the proﬁtability of this business.

A - Philipp Gmur
Rene Locher? Okay.

Q - Rene Locher

{BIO 1921075 <GO>}

Okay. Okay. Fine. Thank you. I guess I missed -- can you please repeat the combined ratio
in Switzerland because, I guess, I missed that one. Thank you.

A - Annelis Luscher Hammerli

{BIO 21606790 <GO>}

Yes, sure. So yes, the question was about the cost ratio in the Swiss business, right?

Q - Rene Locher

{BIO 1921075 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Annelis Luscher Hammerli

{BIO 21606790 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

On the non-life part, of course, and there, this is inﬂuenced besides other eﬀects by
project costs this year.

Q - Rene Locher

{BIO 1921075 <GO>}

Okay. And on this CHF100 million cost eﬃciencies, is this mainly in non-life?

A - Annelis Luscher Hammerli

{BIO 21606790 <GO>}

Yeah. Okay. No, sure, I can comment on that as well. No, this is not only non-life. This
aﬀects the whole as a Group, so also life, but will, of course, have an impact on the cost
ratio as well through the non-life part of the savings program.

Q - Rene Locher

{BIO 1921075 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Philipp Gmur
As you see, Rene, we have some one-oﬀ eﬀects in the cost ratio in Switzerland, which, of
course, will not be seen in the ﬁnancial year of 2021. But apart from that, we also want to
reduce our running cost basis, also in our Swiss business, of course, which brings us back
to an even more competitive number.

{BIO 21606790 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Perfect now. Thanks for letting me to come back. I guess three questions again, if I may.
The ﬁrst one on the dividend. Your target of -- your forward-looking target on the 2020
implies a little bit more than just sort of the normal sort of step-up of 0.2 each year, I
guess. So my reading of that is that maybe 2020 is lower a little bit, but you're trying not
to sort of change the overall trajectory. I don't know if I'm reading too much into that, but
if you can comment on that.
The second question was on the other segment. I guess it's always quite a confusing one
for us to forecast, and there's lots of moving parts. I was wondering if you could just run us
through what you think is a sort of normal run rate by source sort of going forward. Yeah.
Yeah. Sorry, that would be helpful.
And then ﬁnally, maybe just coming back on those eﬃciency targets. Could you just clarify
whether that is going to be -- are you actually looking to reduce the expenses? Or will
some of that be sort of oﬀsetting natural inﬂation and growth of the business. And
presume -- I'm now presuming you can't do an awful lot in the acquisition expenses line.
So when you're looking at non-life, am I right in thinking this has got to sort of come from

Page 18 of 22

the administration, but a little bit more color or detail on how that will work will be very
helpful. Thank you.

FINAL

A - Philipp Gmur
Thank you, Peter. I suggest that I am answering question number three, and will then
hand over to Annelis for question number one and two. Talking about our eﬃciency
targets. Apart from inﬂation eﬀect, of course, which might help us and the whole growth
of the Group, which might help us to have a better cost ratio. We want to eﬀectively
reduce our cost basis by CHF100 million. It's not inﬂationary or whatsoever. And that
means that we are carefully looking at our staﬀ and at our other costs, of course, and by
the end of 2025, we want to stick to this target, CHF100 million. Now Annelis questions
number one and two?

A - Annelis Luscher Hammerli

{BIO 21606790 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. So on the dividend and the trajectory. So we will continue to pursue a dividend
strategy that aims to pay a sustainable dividend to shareholders. And with that, we will -we want to stick to our promise as this year to either slightly increase the dividend yearon-year or to at least in a not so positive year to at least keep it stable. And this
philosophy, let's call it, is -- we continue with that. We still have it in our plan, and it's the
backbone for the dividend part of the 2025 strategy.
Some comments on your question number two, on the other segment. Yes, there are a lot
of moving parts in there. On one hand, the group reinsurance is in there and then the
results out of this part. And then this year, of course, also the ﬁnancing and the integration
costs of Caser and also some aspects of the funds -- of the Helvetia funds are in there.
What we do not provide is, let's say, an assumption of a normalized year in this other
segment.

A - Philipp Gmur
Coming back maybe and adding to Annelis' comments on dividends. The dividend is, of
course, also driven by our net economic dividend capacity, we were talking about with
you a couple of times, I think. And as you may recall, the -- this economic dividend
capacity was roughly CHF700 million by the end of 2019, and we are publishing the new
number by the end of April. When we will come up with the so-called (inaudible) the
reporting about the ﬁnancial situation of Helvetia Group.

Q - Peter Eliot

Are there any further questions? (Operator Instructions) Yes. There is a follow-up question
from Rene Locher. Rene, please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Rene Locher

{BIO 1921075 <GO>}

Yes, thank you very much. So quickly, on the Swiss domestic life business again, which is
I'm wondering a little bit what happened to the return on equity. I mean, on one side, you
have this collaboration with Swisscanto. Now you have reduced the exposure to the
Group life business. I mean, just to get a bit of feeling, have you had a release in required
capital for the Swiss, the domestic life business? So this is the ﬁrst question.
The second one, I mean, it's -- again, it's this number crunching stuﬀ, but that's what the
analysts like to do. If I take your targets in 2025, when I'm right, you're now running a
shareholders' equity of CHF6.4 billion. And I'm right in that there are roughly CHF1.4
billion of unrealized gains, losses. So that means the starting base is like a CHF5 billion.
Now if I take your CHF0.8 to CHF0.11 ROE target, then this would be a calculated proﬁt of
CHF400 million to CHF500 million --

A - Philipp Gmur
We can hardly understand your Rene.

Q - Rene Locher

{BIO 1921075 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay.

A - Philipp Gmur
Please stick to the microphone.

Q - Rene Locher

{BIO 1921075 <GO>}

Yes, yes. It's better now?

A - Philipp Gmur
Yes.

A - Annelis Luscher Hammerli

{BIO 21606790 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Rene Locher

{BIO 1921075 <GO>}

Okay. Sorry. So again, my starting point for the ROE calculation is CHF5 billion, if I'm right.
Now if, I think, the midpoint, 9.5% of your target, I would end about CHF475 million net
proﬁt. And CHF70 million, so that's the total contribution of Caser. You can consolidate
70%. So you get roughly CHF50 million from Caser, but then -- I'm a little -- I'm not
disappointed, but I do believe that the entire Helvetia business ex-Caser has a higher net
proﬁt capacity than just CHF425 million. Perhaps you can also elaborate a bit on big
picture-wise. Thank you very much.

FINAL

Let's start with question number one, maybe, and I then hand over to Annelis. Talking
about Group life business. Of course, as we reported, we had quite some clients leaving
the so-called full coverage BVG model. And either leaving the Helvetia universe, or to a
great extent, joining the Swisscanto or the BVG Helvetia Invest solution.
And by reducing our balance sheet and by reducing our exposure to the Group life
business in the course of adjusting our tariﬀ structures, there was also a reserve free fall,
so to say. So that -- of course, there were some eﬀects in the books. So -- and all in all, we,
of course, strengthened the -- by doing so, strengthened the proﬁtability of the Group life
business and reduced the exposure to the interest rate and demographic risks going with
this second pillar business. Now talking about the target and the target range. And as you
put it, playing with all those numbers and their calculations, I hand over to the CFO.

A - Annelis Luscher Hammerli

{BIO 21606790 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you, Philipp. Yes. I would here like to take the time to look at the numbers with
Susanne. I wrote down some numbers that you mentioned, but I think it makes sense that
we give you a more precise answer on this. The calculation is, of course, not as simple as
that. But I propose that we take it up with the Investor Relations team later on.
