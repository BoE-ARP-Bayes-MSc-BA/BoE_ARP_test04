Presentation
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Ageas conference call for the nine months results
of 2013. I'm pleased to present Bart De Smet, CEO, and Christophe Boizard, CFO.
(Operator Instructions) Gentlemen, please begin.

Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen; thank you all for dialing in to this conference call. It's
a busy day for you, so we will present to you the nine months 2013 results of Ageas. I'm,
as usual, joined in the room by the colleagues of the executive committee and also
Antonio Cano, CEO of AG Insurance and, of course, our investor relations team.
Ladies and gentlemen. in line with our results in the first half, the Third Quarter has
confirmed the earlier trend. Inflows, operating performance and net profit of insurance
have all moved in the right direction, in line with the targets we communicated at the
recent investors' update. And the results are well spread across all business segments.

FINAL

The main headlines of the results announced today can be found on slide two in a textual
format and on slide three in a graph format of the presentation. I will briefly comment on
that.
The Group inflows, including the non-consolidated partnerships at 100%, amount to
EUR17.8 billion, 15% up on last year. The Third Quarter of EUR5.3 billion is somewhat lower
than in the previous quarters and this reflects a typical seasonal pattern. In addition, we
continue to see growing volumes in Asia, but at a slightly slower pace than earlier this
year.
If we compare this quarter to the same quarter last year, inflows are up 13%, marked by
much higher inflows in Continental Europe. The latter did really well in the past quarter,
with inflows up more than 16% year on year. This confirms the positive trends from
previous quarters, with good volumes in Portugal, France and Luxembourg.
In Asia, inflows year to date amount to EUR7.9 billion, up 36%; the inflow levels from
Ageas part amount to EUR8.8 billion, up 8% on last year on last year.

Bloomberg Transcript

The net insurance profit amounted to EUR497 million, 11% better than last year. The net
result in the Third Quarter amounted to EUR168 million, 14% ahead of last year's Third
Quarter. Year to date, the improvements in results derived from the activities in Belgium
and Continental Europe, the latter also benefiting from a positive non-recurring result in
Turkey in the Second Quarter.
Looking at the split between life and non-life, most of the improvement comes from the
better non-life and other results, up 19%. The total result amounted to EUR186 million, of
which EUR58 million in the Third Quarter. The improvement related to a higher
contribution from the non-consolidated partnerships in Asia and Continental Europe, and
in operating performance, which remained strong.
The combined ratio of the consolidated activities improved again to 97.6%, again closer to
the target of 97% set at the investor update. Prior year reserve leases overall reduced
from 3.8% to 2.8%, while the current year claims ratio benefited from benign weather
conditions.
The expense ratio suffered from lower average premiums and higher commission,
especially in the UK.
The life results year to date amounted to EUR311 million, 6% up, helped by a strong Third
Quarter result, especially in Belgium and Asia of EUR110 million.
The operating margin on guaranteed products at Ageas level remained steady at 87
basis points. And at 47 basis points, the margin on unit-linked products fits well within the
target range we communicated. The year-to-date improvement mainly comes from the
Belgian activities, with a net result of EUR190 million compared to EUR165 million last year.

FINAL

The life technical liabilities for the consolidated entities remained stable, compared to the
end of June, at EUR69 billion. In the non-consolidated partnerships, the technical liabilities
amounted to EUR40.2 billion, up from EUR36.2 billion end of last year.
And the Group net profit amounted to EUR513 million year to date, with the net profit in
general account of EUR15 million. Staff and operating expenses came down further year
to date. And of the EUR127 million net loss in the Third Quarter, EUR108 million related to
the revised calculation of the RPN(i) liability.
You will recall that we announced this during our investor update and that we published a
spreadsheet on our website to help you to calculate this item. We nevertheless have the
impression that not all analysts have used this when preparing their Q3 results preview. In
the future, we will post the exact amount at the end of each quarter on our website.
To end, as usual a word on the evolution of shareholders' equity and solvency;
shareholders' equity came down to EUR8.7 billion. A further decrease of the unrealized
gains on fixed income, but also the inclusion in the Third Quarter of the planned EUR1 per
share capital reduction, offset the addition of the positive Group net profit.
For your info, the payout date of the capital decrease is foreseen for December 13.

Bloomberg Transcript

And lastly, the insurance and Group solvency ratio remained strong and steady at 210%,
and 226% respectively.
Ladies and gentlemen. I would now like to hand over to Christophe, to comment on the
respective business segments. Christophe, the floor is yours.

Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Thank you, Bart. To complement Bart's presentation, I will provide you with some
additional comments on three things. The operating results by insurance segments; the
general account, focusing on the RPN(i) liability; and then, the investment portfolio.
Let's start first with our insurance operations, and I am on slide four now.
Our Belgian operations reported a net profit of EUR247 million, 14% up on last year,
benefiting from a solid Third Quarter, with a profit of EUR87 million, and driven by strong
life margins.
Year to date inflows were down by 12% to EUR4.4 billion, with life inflow down 18% to
EUR3 billion, as a result of the lower sale in individual savings, a fairly constant trend since
the beginning of the year.
Individual unit-linked sales increased by 61%, supported by successful sale campaigns in
the first half especially. Customer appetite for these products remained good in the Third

Page 3 of 26



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity

Quarter as well.

FINAL

In non-life, gross inflows reached EUR1.4 billion year to date, up 5%, reflecting a
combination of volumes and tariff increases.
Coming back on the net result, the life net result in the Third Quarter amounted to EUR68
million, 27% up on last year. Strong operating results and lower effective tax rate, following
a different mix of investment results, were the main drivers.
The operating margin on guaranteed products remain stable from one quarter to
another, and we are at 84 bps, and we are well in line with our target, while the operating
margin on unit-linked products improved from 41 bps to 44 bps.
In non-life, the net result year to date amounted to EUR57 million, up 11%; thanks to a
combined ratio year to date of 97.6%, which is a good performance, close to the mediumterm target we said during the investor day.

Bloomberg Transcript

The Third Quarter combined ratio stood at 97.9%, benefiting from a satisfactory motor
performance, while the other segments retained the strong results from the previous
quarters. And this, bearing in mind that the reserves have been strengthened with
respect to the introduction of VAT charges on lawyer fees, as of 2014 on.
You may ask why we increase the reserve for something which will be enforced starting in
2014. This is related to technical reserve, where the lawyer fees will be invoiced for next
year, even though the corresponding claims are booked as accounting year 2013.
The headlines for our second segment, the UK, can be found on slide 5. The net result
year to date amounted to EUR87 million, slightly up, and with a Third Quarter net result of
EUR29 million.
Year to date, the non-life result was up 6% to EUR77 million, including a net result of EUR14
million related to Groupama UK. Keep in mind that Groupama UK is consolidated now. It
was not the case last year, since the consolidation took place in November of last year.
So this increase is largely offset by the lower result of Tesco, and, to a lesser extent, AIL;
both businesses suffering from lower average premium and volumes in motor. Average
premium across the market came down by 14% year on year, however.
The performance in household, on the contrary, remained strong, with a combined ratio
of 86.3% year to date; obviously, benefiting from the benign weather so far, but also
thanks to the actions taken in the past years.
Let me also highlight that the integration of Groupama UK within AIL, to create one single
insurance business, was approved by the court in late October. So this means that the
integration process is well on track here.

FINAL

Lastly, a word on our retail segment, where the net results decreased year to date to
EUR12 million, including a one-off deferred tax benefit of EUR3 million, originating from the
merger of Ageas 50 and Castle Cover. Here, the entire market, but especially the
(inaudible) remained under heavy competitive pressure also this quarter.
On our third segment, slide six of the presentation, Continental Europe. The net result
amounted to EUR63 million, 28% higher than last year, but with a net gain of EUR9 million,
a one-off, due to the sale of a building in Turkey, for the first half of the year. Actually, we
sold the headquarter in Turkey. So it's a one-off to be mentioned, EUR9 million.
The most important element here is certainly the excellent life inflow levels in Q3,
amounting to EUR1 billion, 84% up on last year. We can mention Portugal, which had a very
successful unit linked campaign. France did well too. In Luxembourg good news too;
inflows continued to grow steadily, reflecting good wealth management businesses flows
from the French business partners.
Non-life now. In non-life inflows year to date in Turkey were up 8%, despite our focus on
profitable growth. As a result, our product mix in that country has evolved toward more
household and less motor, which is a less profitable line of business.

Bloomberg Transcript

The net results year to date of Continental Europe for life activities remain virtually
unchanged at EUR36 million with a higher contribution from non-consolidated partnerships
and the lower tax rate offsetting the lower result in Portugal.
The year-to-date non-life net result more than doubled to EUR26 million, entirely driven
by the Turkish activities.
The combined ratio year to date remained excellent at 94.5%.
Lastly, Asia, so slide 7. No drastic change in trend versus previous quarters; if not, a more
moderate year-on-year inflow growth compared to the first two quarters. Life inflows
were up 40% year to date, but only 14% on the Third Quarter, so there is a slowdown
here. Both the bank and the agency channels show growth percentages above 50%,
partly explained, in the case of the agency channel, by the strong increase in the number
of agents.
It is encouraging to see that, in the meantime, renewal premiums make up almost 50% of
total inflows.
All countries show good growth except for Malaysia, where we are in a transition phase in
both the bank and agency channels toward more sustainable regular premium, and this
had some impact on the sale volumes.
The total net life results year to date amounted to EUR87 million, showing a decrease
compared to the EUR92 million of last year, with the Third Quarter at EUR31 million

Page 5 of 26

compared to the EUR23 million we had last year. Excluding the positive non-recurring
items of last year, the net result improved by some EUR11 million.

FINAL

Organic growth and a good investment performance across the region were partially
offset by the higher business costs in China, especially in the first half, where we saw this
very big development in the volumes.
This brings me now to the general account on slide 10. Bart already mentioned the net
loss in the Third Quarter of EUR127 million, of which EUR108 million which was the
consequence of the revised RPN(i) valuation methodology.
At the end of September, the RPN(i) liability stood at EUR279 million compared to EUR165
million at the end of December and EUR171 million at the end of June. So you can see the
big increase at the end of September, obviously due to the change in methodology.

Bloomberg Transcript

At the investor update we explained that the introduction of IFRS 13 imposed a review of
the valuation approach of the RPN(i). More details on this change can be found in our
interim financial statements, but during the investor day we explained at length all the
different argument to change the methodology and we explained the new mechanisms,
the formula, etc.
Lastly, staff and operating costs year to date amounted to EUR33 million, a reduction of
EUR4 million year to date. Costs in the Third Quarter amounted to EUR13 million. Now you
will remember that the general account, apart from all the financial legacies, includes the
costs of the holding Ageas SA/NV.
With respect to the investment portfolio, slide 11, two comments to make. The total value
slightly decreased to EUR74.7 billion, mainly due to two things. First, the reduction in
unrealized gain and losses on the fixed income portfolio, but let's say, more or less half,
and then the reinvestment of the NITSH I which took place in August and the amount was
denominated in $750 million.
You will remember that this NITSH 1 was 100% on lend[ph] to Fortis Bank, which is not
within the consolidation scope, so in our investment it appear as an asset. And the call of
this instrument is a decrease in the loan section.
The second comment I'd like to make on the investment, we have some limited
reallocation on our asset mix, with a further slight increase in equities. Then the second
element which brought attention is reduction in loans. It is due to the call of the NITSH 1, as
mentioned previously. The equivalent in euro is around EUR560 million.
Slide 11, solvency at 210%, so above our objective of 200%. Please keep in mind that here,
we don't have any impact of a foreseeable dividend. It will be slightly different at the end
of Q4 because, by the time we will release the result the dividend will be known, and the
210% will decrease towards the medium-term objective of 200%. So don't be impressed

FINAL

by the fact that we are on a rising trend; that's kind of seasonal effect. We don't have a
dividend (inaudible).
On slide 12 we have the breakdown of the evolution of the shareholder equity. Bart
already mentioned the main element to explain the decease. It came down further so
now we are at EUR8.7 billion, or EUR38.30 per share. The move is essentially due to the
recognition of the EUR1 per share capital reduction after the approval at the recent
shareholders' general meeting. So it means that it is booked as a liability now, even
though this amount will be paid in December as previously announced.
Two words on the net cash position general account, slide 13. The cash position stood at
EUR2 billion, with only the expense of EUR33 million on the new share buyback program,
as major movement, but let's say that things are stable here.
To end my presentation, two words on slide 17, the tangible net equity. The tangible net
equity is at 90% of the IFRS equity, which shows the strength and the quality of the
reported capital, so not a lot of goodwill or things of that kind.
Ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to end my comments here and to hand over to Frank.

{BIO 15168443 <GO>}

Thank you, Christophe; thank you, Bart. Ladies and gentlemen. this concludes the
introduction. Normally we allow you to ask three questions, but for the sake of time, and
knowing that some other companies are also having their analyst call after us, we would
propose to stick to two questions. And we propose if you have more questions and there
is time don't hesitate to go back in the row of the other questions further on.
Thank you. Operator?

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Ashik Musaddi, JP Morgan.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

A couple of questions. First, can you give us some color on your M&A strategy at this
point, given recent press speculation that you are looking at some of the Italian non-life
operations? Can you give us some color on what's happening and an update on that?
Secondly, your Asian earnings looks to be up roughly 10% year on year on a comparable
basis, excluding the one-off last year. So how should we think about the run rate, going
forward, i.e., 10% growth, is it a normal expectation that you have, or how should we think
about that? That would be two questions. Thanks.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay, thanks for the questions. On the first one, M&A strategy, I think, to be honest, that
we can mention that nothing's changed compared to what we announced at the investor
update. It means that we know that part of this EUR2 billion cash we have at this moment,
we look at opportunities to invest in business. Of course, always in business where we can
comply with the criteria that we've set.
One of the most important ones is to reach the 11%[ph] return on equity. We also gave
some indications about what regions we look at this, meaning that in markets
consolidation is certainly something we look at, and we also look to growing in emerging
markets. But more than that, at this stage, I don't think we can tell, and we will stick
rigorously to our prudency in terms of M&A, but nevertheless, look to potential nice
opportunities to further develop the Group aligned with the vision we expressed a year
ago and where we confirmed this in September.

Bloomberg Transcript

For the second question, the Asian earnings. I think, as you can see also in the comments
on the results end of Q3, that we have this more heavy impact in the immediate P&L of
the strong growth in China. We do not expect that there will be fantastic changes in the
profile of the growth in Asia, so we will continue to grow. We have also this ambition, we
also, as indicated will look at investing more of our shareholders' equity in the growing
markets.
So logically, and that's also part of the measures or the effects we announced to reach
11% return on equity is that we expect, in the future, a bigger contribution from the
growing markets in the total net profit of the Group and the return on equity achievement.
So it could be certainly translated in an ambition to grow the contribution from Asia in the
years going forward.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Thanks. But just a follow-up on the previous M&A thing. Any comments you would want to
make on the press speculation around you looking at Italian operations, non-life, to be
more specifically the part that Unipol or Fon-Sai may need to sell in the future?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

We look at whatever opportunity that is in the market where we could be seeing some
interest for us. And as you know, we will never comment on files[ph] if they're not more
concrete. If time is there to communicate, we will do it.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

Q - Albert Ploegh

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

FINAL

Two questions from my side. The first one is, are you already in a position maybe to give
some quantification of the potential impact that the recent storms might have had on the
Fourth Quarter results, especially on Belgium and the UK?
And the second question is related to the Belgium life operations, clearly decent margins.
Can you maybe give a bit of your thoughts already on the potential profit sharing? Clearly,
you provision also for that on a quarterly basis. And maybe can give a bit of an update on
the competitive environment and is there any potential positive surprise coming in Q4,
that you might can get away with a bit less profit sharing than you now probably expect?
Thank you.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. I can be quite precise on the first question. I will be a bit more vague on the second
one.

Bloomberg Transcript

The recent storms, we estimate that the impact in Q4 of the storms we have had a week
ago, so in Belgium, as in the UK, will be in the order of magnitude of something like EUR5
million. EUR5 million for each, UK and Belgium. This is after minorities, after tax. So that's
what we assume as net profit impact.
For Belgium life, as you know profit sharing, first of all, is something that you only can
decide once the full year has been completed, where in any case, we will look to the
competition, but it's not that we try to be best or the worst. In the past years we've shown
a quite stable profit sharing performance in the market which also led to a lot of trust of
not only the distribution channels, but also the end customers, reflected in quite low
lapses. So we will decide by the end of the year, but okay it will be, and that's not so
secret, we will in any case, each time, also take our decisions linked to the margins we
want to achieve.

Q - Albert Ploegh

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

Okay. Very clear.

Operator
(Operator Instructions) Matthias De Wit, KBC Securities.

Q - Matthias De Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

Two questions from my side as well, please. First on the sequential movements in
insurance actually the[ph] solvency; it increased 4percentage points on the previous
quarter. What is the main driver of this sequential increase? I noticed that in Belgium,
solvency's strongly up, but in the Asia it is down sequentially, presumably because of the
foreign exchange impacts. If you could just confirm this, please?

Page 9 of 26

Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2013-11-06

FINAL

And also related to that, you're currently significantly ahead of the 200% target at hold
co[ph] level. So should we already bank on increase in the remittance ratio from the units
to the holding from the current 50% level over 2013? Or is it a bit too early to expect
anything like that?
And then the second question is on non-life. The cost ratio is up almost 3percentage
points in the first nine months of the year and so the improvement in the claims ratio is,
therefore, partially offset. Just wondered if you see any opportunity to get the cost ratio
down, either thanks to efficiency gains or other cost savings initiatives? Thanks.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

I take your first question regarding solvency. So maybe I was too quick in my introductory
comments, but the effect is rather simple. The solvency increased by the retained profit
quarter over quarter, so we don't distribute dividend based on 2013. You have this slightly
increasing trend, and you are right that we gained, that we are up by 4 point, I think, with
respect to what we had at the end of Q2.

Bloomberg Transcript

When will we declare the dividend? This will go down, so let's try to give some rough
figures. The base for the percentage is roughly EUR4 billion, so 10% point above 200%
means EUR400 million; we are on the[ph] insurance code[ph]. So it means that as soon as
you upstream EUR400 million of dividend coming from the subsidiaries you are back to
200%. You deduct holding costs and that's the base which is theoretically available to pay
the dividend to the shareholders of Ageas.
So that's why I give you the big figures, to tell you that everything is consistent to maintain
the objective of 200%, and we will do our best to come back to 200%.

Q - Matthias De Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

So we shouldn't expect any increase in the payout ratio from the operating earnings to
the hold co of the current 50% level then?

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

I cannot be more precise at this stage; it's too early. I give you the main principal, but the
objective is to stay at 200%. Obviously, the main driver is the dividend coming from the
subsidiaries, so that's the adjusting factor.

Q - Matthias De Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

Thank you.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

And the second question on the increase of the expense ratio. If you go a bit more
deeper into the segment figures, you will see that the increase is primarily due to the UK,
where it's a combination of a change in product mix, also with integration of Groupama.
Commissions are a bit higher because the products were also different products.

Page 10 of 26



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2013-11-06

FINAL

It's also linked to costs we have made in order exactly to reduce costs over time, so it's
the synergy costs. It is not a Q3 impact; we already see it since the beginning of the year. I
think the philosophy we follow, the strategy we follow, not only in UK but everywhere, is to
be very attentive to, let's say, the positioning towards the peers, to be attentive to be in
each of the markets where we play an important role, to be amongst the best in terms of
cost efficiency in the markets.
And finally, as also indicated in the investor update, we manage the business in terms of
the overall margins we make. So in order to achieve our 97% combined ratio, it's a
combination of cost/loss ratio, but also expense, meaning commission and cost ratio.
Also, in Continental Europe, you see commissions going a bit up, but it is for instance also
linked to the shift in some of the markets to a bit less in motor and a bit more in
household which is on average increasing -- increased commissions.

Q - Matthias De Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks.

Q - Tom Van Kempen

{BIO 17194522 <GO>}

Two questions also from my side. The first one is you announced at the investor day that
you were planning to transfer part of the FRESH capital to the insurance operations. I
assume that it's a bit too early for Third Quarter results to actually see any changes there,
but could you provide us with an update on where you are in that process as of today?
That's the first question.
And the second one is, sorry to come back to this, but on acquisitions. It seems to me like
there is not a lot of very appealing assets out there at the moment, at least in developed
countries. Could you give us a bit more flavor at what you're looking at, at the moment;
have you identified already several interesting assets and are you starting to look a bit
more also at the emerging markets?

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Okay. I take your first question upon the FRESH, so first I think it's[ph] right to explain again
the mechanism because maybe it was not 100% clear to everybody.
We won't move FRESH; the FRESH are held by the general account; they won't be moved.
What we indicated during the investor day that we will kind of mentally rebuild and on
the[ph] lending structure by matching on the asset side of the general account some loan
to the subsidiaries with FRESH which are on the liability. Give leverage in the insurance
scope and to create a positive carry in the general account tax free.

FINAL

Now an update on the situation. We indicated a medium-term objective of EUR400 million
during the investor day. What I can tell you is that things are on track; we are actively
working with AG to put things in place. And I don't want to be extremely precise because
things are not completed, but there is a high probability that something will be achieved
by the end of the year, as announced during the investor day. So end of December you
will see the first action visible in the financials.

Q - Tom Van Kempen

{BIO 17194522 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

The question on acquisitions, I think you're right, it's not a big list of potential targets.
What we do and maybe sorry to repeat is that, first of all we look to opportunities that fit,
or can fit with our strategic ambitions, but also with the financial conditions that we have
explained.
We then look in Europe, you could say primarily in markets where we are present,
because this could give us additional synergies. And we then look, of course, to positions
in markets where we are, or also in new markets in the Asian region and, let's say, the
growth markets.

Bloomberg Transcript

But you're right to indicate that the list of potential targets that enter into that category in
Europe, in any case, is fairly limited. And, okay, for the growth markets we continuously
look around to grab interesting opportunities.

Q - Tom Van Kempen

{BIO 17194522 <GO>}

Okay. So no real tendency, at this moment, confirmed that you are looking more towards
the emerging markets than the developed ones?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

As I say, if you look to the emerging markets I think it's also a bit linked to our profile. We
will more look to the markets where the growth potential is still important, and we talk
about markets like Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam where we also can already with existing
partners or on our own with strong local partners build something new. So it's more a
smaller start, but with a high growth potential, one we have been able to show in
countries like Thailand, Malaysia, India, China.

Q - Maarten Altena

{BIO 15898902 <GO>}

FINAL

I have a question on the guaranteed margin, or basically the unit link margin after it
dropped to 47 bps, albeit still within your target. I was just wondering how Asia develops
within this margin story, and, or more specifically Hong Kong, following the organic growth
which you mentioned on slide 28?
And my second question will be on the investment portfolios, whether you would be able
to share your portfolio yields, your reinvestment yields and the guaranteed yield on your - the guarantees on your -- in the Third Quarter? Thanks.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. Unit link margin, if you compare the overall Ageas margin with the one year ago,
remind that one year ago there was, in Belgium, an exceptional income recovery from
Lehman Brothers that influenced the margin positively.
If you look to the margins we make on the unit link in Asia, maybe important to indicate
that the type of products is a bit different from the one we have in Europe.

Bloomberg Transcript

In Europe, it's quite in line with just the mutual fund business, whereas in Asia, unit link is
sold much more in a combination with protection business, which is one of the reasons
why the margins are, in general, higher.
We have had a quite maybe strange first nine months this time in what you refer to, the
slide on Asia which is the consolidated entity, so it's about Hong Kong. That's more linked
to a number of non-recurring elements a year ago, and also, let's say, the fact that these
products are sold with acquisition costs, which is not the case in Europe.
So the business is difficult to compare in Hong Kong with the one we have primarily in
Luxembourg, Belgium and Portugal.

Q - Maarten Altena

{BIO 15898902 <GO>}

But if I can add to that, so would you basically say that the faster you grow in Asia the
better it is for the unit link margin, that's basically what you're saying?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

In any case, that's overall an element in Asia, that in a number of these countries which still
are in a position of what you can call an expense overrun. So the loadings in the products
are not covering the costs we make, and as the portfolios are growing the more and
more this gap is reduced and we'll come to a position where the expense margin
becomes positive instead of being negative.
You take the second one, Christophe, the investment portfolio?

What was the question on the investment portfolio?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

FINAL

The investment yields (multiple speakers).

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

On the (reinvestment) yield you're right, that's something we disclose at every call. We
are slightly above what we told you last quarter; the reinvestment rate is at 3.28%[ph]
year to date, that's three quarters, so 3.28% year to date. And then if we take the
investment yield on the whole portfolio it is closer to 3.8%, 3.9%[ph] and 3.28% on the
new money[ph].
On the yield on the investment portfolio, it is pretty stable, thanks to the fact that we have
no duration gap. You remember that the fact that we have zero duration gap on our
portfolio means that we have stable margins on the in-force.

Q - Maarten Altena

{BIO 15898902 <GO>}

And did the average guarantee come down further or --?

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And the average guarantee came down further, for sure, since we are in the decreasing
trend. You remember we set the minimum at 1.5%[ph] beginning of the year, so now we
are at 2.80% to 2.82%[ph], all in all weighted average.

Q - Maarten Altena

{BIO 15898902 <GO>}

Perfect. Thank you.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

So it means that the margin quite decent[ph]. If you take into account the 1.5% of
guaranteed rate and the fact that we invest at 3.28%, still okay, and is the reason why
margin are stable quarter over quarter.

And then also, on your UK acquisition of Groupama, what impact of the completion of the

insurance business transfer was completed on October 31? Is there any other impacts in
this line of business please?

FINAL

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. Malaysia is a country which we have, for many years, quite stable results in terms of
top line. It is not growing like we have seen in China or in Thailand. The most important
change that has been introduced since the beginning of this year is a clear attention to
move much more, or to give much more attention, to the regular premium than single
premium. So the volumes in single premium have been reduced, and this is a safe
transition process we will have to go through in the coming quarters.
It's something similar we have seen, if my memory is correct in 2011, I think, in China,
where the inflow remained flat year on year. We really created a shift from the less
profitable single premium business to the more profitable regular premium business. This
is, let's say, the biggest target or challenge for the Company to make this transition. We
see this change coming slowly in the figures; there is still some work to do. But we
prioritize priority on, as well, transformation in the agent channel, but also the motivation
of the bank channel to really invest much more in selling of regular premiums.
Then the second question on Groupama, I'm not sure I fully -- can you please repeat the
question?

It was with regards to the completion of the transfer of 1.5 million (multiple speakers)

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

So we received an agreement to merge Groupama with AIL. This is fully underway so,
legally, we will move to one legal entity of regrouping the business from AIL and
Groupama. We already moved people to the same buildings; works are done to integrate
IT systems and so on. And if you look to the results of Groupama, we can say that they
are above expectations for this year, and that we expect them to be performing more
than what we initially expected when we closed the deal.
We already, of course, decided to acquire Groupama last year based on a more than solid
business case and so, this time, we can confirm that expectations are higher for the future
than what the business case has been.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Okay. So it's just a case of the integration process going over another step, really?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

First of all, legally, there's another step but also, in the meantime, I must say that also all
people working for Groupama and AIL, everybody knows there is future challenges. And

Q - Chris Esson

{BIO 6194371 <GO>}

Just two quick questions, please; firstly on tax. You did refer to it in the pack today, and it's
pretty clear when you go through the numbers that there has been an element of tax rate
benefit coming through the results, not enormous but still there. Just as we're thinking
about 2014, should we think about 2013 or nine month 2013 levels as being normalized, or
should we expect some sort of push back upwards and, therefore, a slight headwind in
terms of the net result, looking forward?

Bloomberg Transcript

Secondly, just going back to Ashik's initial question on Asia. So in Taiping Life we have
seen agency numbers increase sharply; there was also a big push on sales volumes in the
first half of the year. Is it possible to quantify what that has meant in terms of incremental
cost, in terms of strain for you? And is that heavy investment, heavy growth phase likely to
persist into next year, or should we expect it to fall out? Thank you.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

I'll take the tax question, so on tax I consider that 2000[ph] is more, let's say, the
reference under[ph] the normal tax rate. The difference comes from the different taxation
of capital gain in Belgium. In Belgium when we realize capital gain on equity you pay no
tax. This year we have some capital gain coming from equities, this is tax free and the
average rate goes down. Last year it was more on bonds, and on bonds you pay the
taxes.
It's a mix, according to the capital gain composition, if it is bond equity real estate but I
would say 2013 is quite normal and standard.

Q - Chris Esson

{BIO 6194371 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. The question Taiping and the strong increase of number of agents, indeed it has
been doubled over time[ph], number of agents, which means a lot of upfront costs in
recruitment, in training, but also in financing the new business that these new agents have
been writing. So knowing that this is a channel that will primarily work on regular premiums,
you can expect that, first of all, the initial training costs they have been taken fully in the
first year, that this will help, on one hand, to support future growth. Secondly, in a
Page 16 of 26

Date: 2013-11-06

FINAL

profitable business line and that there, again, also the effect on costs will be positively
influenced by the future growth at that moment becoming more and more an
experienced channel.
But of course, you understand that we cannot give detailed figures as the mother
company is also a listed company. But I would say a big increase now so it has an impact
on cost, but this is something that, over time, should fade away, thanks to continued
growth in a profitable product range.

Q - Chris Esson

{BIO 6194371 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you, very much.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

One element on taxes, one additional element; I was telling you that 2013 is quite normal
to support this. We have some unrealized capital gain on equities now, EUR300 million if I
remember correctly, so it means that, in the future, we may assume that some normal
rates of realization of capital gain will take place.

{BIO 3349136 <GO>}

Just two questions on the UK non-life business, please. First of all, in the UK non-life
investment result, on a quarterly basis that seems to have been fading quite substantially
quarter on quarter; I think it was EUR15.2 million in the Third Quarter compared to EUR22.4
million in the second and EUR19.3 million in the first. Could you just explain what's going on
with that and whether that just respects a short duration and that's the kind of number we
need to work with, going forward?
And then secondly, in terms of the UK claims ratio, combined ratio, I find that quite difficult
to forecast quarter on quarter. Are you effectively pricing for a target combined ratio of
around 97%? Would that be a good way of thinking about things, looking ahead?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

So the first question was about the investment result in UK non-life?

Q - William Elderkin

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay, so maybe I can give you some elements on the UK. So on the UK first, in the past
quarters, we realized some capital gains on bonds, which boosted the result. Now, the
capital gain conduct[ph] this is due to the fact that the asset allocation in the UK, in the
start we consider it was too conservative.
We are changing our views and trying to boost the result. We have hired a new asset
manager in the UK, so we are a little bit in a transition period and so we are moving
assets from -- and we have the high production of AAA bonds. We realized the capital
gain to move towards another asset. So it's the reason why you have this impression of
decreasing trend.
We have realized capital gains and we had a high level of cash. Obviously, with the twoyear yield and three-year yield[ph], and now we are implementing the new strategic asset
allocation, so a kind of transition phase here on the assets.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Maybe to add to Christophe's comments, so if you look to the full year, the investment
result is stable, EUR56.6 million, now EUR56.9 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

There is, indeed, a change in the Third Quarter last year. We had EUR7 million cap gains
more than this year. And for the full year, we have EUR8 million cap gains less than last
year. So with a stable investment result over nine months, but lower capital gains, you
could say that the average performance, excluding cap gains, has been better.
And then the combined ratio, so the combined ratio, also for us the target is 97%. We are
not that far away. Of course, the market is very competitive. We have, as mentioned in the
introductory intervention, benign situations in household.
And we have, of course, the potential, like all our competitors, in the market on motor to
see to what extent the reductions in premiums really covered reductions in claims that are
expected. But we cannot say how then, first of all, the 97% target is an overall Ageas
target, but we, at this moment, try to achieve it in all the market where we are active.

Q - William Elderkin

{BIO 3349136 <GO>}

Okay. So that sequential drop on the investment income it's in the UK, essentially[ph], that
the Third Quarter has very little, if any, capital gains within it compared to the first and
second?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Even there, I think the effect of cap gains is something like EUR6 million for the full year. It
was EUR14 million a year ago and so I think out of the EUR6 million, EUR2 million was this
quarter for 2013 and it was EUR9 million a year ago. So that's --

Just to come back on the pricing on non-life, what trend do you see currently? You have
been putting in your slides that we have seen so far minus 14% decrease in motor and
non-life. What do you see sequentially quarter on quarter? Is that still worsening, or do
you think the worst is behind us?

Bloomberg Transcript

What will be the strategy of Ageas versus this pricing pressure? Are you participating to
the game or are you -- what will be the strategy in looking into 2014?
And could you also talk about pricing of non-life in Belgium? I think gross written premiums
were up nicely again at 4% this quarter. So could you talk a bit on pricing there?
Then I was surprised by the low production levels in unit link in Belgium in the Third
Quarter. I think it's down 32% year on year in the Third Quarter. I just wanted to know why.
What is happening there? I think initially, we were expecting some pickup in production
there.
And what is your view on the production of guaranteed products in Belgium? It's down
13% year on year in the Third Quarter. What is your market share doing in Belgium life on
the guaranteed side?

Christophe.

Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2013-11-06

FINAL

First of all, with respect to UK, what we see, and it's quite clear, is that premiums come
down in the whole market, also in our portfolio. But we also see the frequency coming
down. We see the severity of the claims coming down. So we believe that there is no
reason to be really, let's say, too much puzzled about it.
But having said that, we are more on the side where we, in any case, prefer profitability
above volume. So we will not enter into the volume game and we will be very cautious. It's
one of the reasons, for instance, why we didn't get Tesco. We moved from, let's say,
targeting all kind of clients of Tesco to the more loyal clients of Tesco, which is going to
the less risky segments where, of course, the average premiums are lower, and this is
what you see in the premium volumes.
Pricing in non Belgium, I would say, and I talk a bit under control of Antonio who is here
sitting next to me, we don't see any tendency of reducing prices. And I think you can
expect again that, certainly in some product lines, prices will slightly go up, as it has been
done in the previous years.
We have this additional VAT on lawyer fees that is introduced as of next year. So this will
certainly have an impact on the premiums -- of the pricing of the products where these
kind of interventions from lawyers is foreseen.

Bloomberg Transcript

Maybe one remark still to give on the UK non-life, the average decrease in the market is
12% to 14%. In our case, it's more on average something like 5%, the reduction.
Then, the third question was about the unit link and why less in Q3 in Belgium. Unit link in
Belgium is not a product that is sold in, I would say, a continuous recurring way. It's always
linked to campaigns. The biggest producer is, of course, the bank. So it's more a question
of campaigns that are set up or not and Q3 being also a quarter with two months where
people are on holidays. It's not the ideal month for campaigns.
So what we see, in any case, that the volume in unit link for Ageas doubles and that the
market share is going up, which is also the case in the guaranteed business. So the
market is -- and lot depends on what kind of products you take together. But if you look to
the individual life markets, I'm not talking about group life where volumes go up, individual
life market in Belgium is minus 29% after six months, and AG was minus 30%[ph].
So there is a decrease, but we believe that our decrease can be kept at a lower level than
the industry; primarily also, thanks to a quite solid and stable profit-sharing policy over the
past years. And I think the consequence of this always that we, again, take some market
share in life in Belgium. But we will not -- because that could also be a question are you
intending to increase the guaranteed rate. This is not at all on the agenda, not for us. I
don't think that competitors in Belgium think about raising the guaranteed rate. So there is
also, from that side, quite some discipline in the market.

Q - Benoit Petrarque

{BIO 15997668 <GO>}

Okay.

So RPI, two points. First, from an administrative standpoint, I would say that everything is
proceeding according to plan, which means that the last instrument will be moved to the
buyer this month. The capital reduction and annual[ph] capital reduction is contemplated
and is on the agenda of upcoming Board of this month. So we expect something, but
nothing new according to plan.
The DTA[ph] we have is confirmed, and will be repaid by the Belgian tax authority. So I
would say all the indicators on the administrative standpoint are on the green. No
problem. But I guess you are more interested on the claim side. Despite the
intensification of news flow, the discussion, nothing to report here. And we have really no
striking news on our case. We will be meeting our lawyers in the coming weeks. What I can
only confirm is that the amount of claim is around EUR3.8 billion, and I have nothing new to
report.

Q - Jason Kalamboussis

{BIO 4811408 <GO>}

I just have two quick questions. The first one is on your combined ratio in Belgium. If I look
at the expense ratio, it has been remarkably stable over the last years. But when we look
at what some of your peers are reporting in their segmental reporting for Belgium, they
do seem to be showing expense ratios that are closer to 30%. Is it an area where you
think that, at a certain point, you could improve? Or should we assume that this ratio is the
one that we should be seeing, going forward?
And the second thing is, in Asia, the earnings are coming very nicely in most of the nonconsolidated markets. I just wanted to understand, on Hong Kong, when we look at the
EUR34 million[ph] that you had as net income last year, how much of it is one off ? And if
we look, for example, now we have the Third Quarter was just a bit better, but how do
you see it basically? What should we be thinking as a more normalized number, going
forward, specifically for Hong Kong?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

The first question, I mentioned it earlier, we quite in detail look at all the peers in Belgium
in terms of cost expense ratios, which is costs and commissions. And you can see if you
look also to the publicly available figures that the expense ratio of AG Insurance is, on
average, 2% to 3% lower than the industry. That, compared to the main competitors, it's
Page 21 of 26



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2013-11-06

FINAL

primarily the difference is made in the costs, not in the commissions, of course, that are
more market norms.
To give you come figures, the commissions in the market for car insurance are something
like 16%; for fire insurance, it's 27%. So peers having an expense ratio, so including
commissions of 13%[ph], we don't know them, so probably. I'm happy to discuss it with
you maybe in a separate call with investor relations. But as mentioned, we look to the
peers every six months. And that's what -- three zero, I'm sorry, I understood 13%. 30%
even there. The only possibility you could have really is a player who is not working with
distribution that is commission.

Q - Jason Kalamboussis

{BIO 4811408 <GO>}

And the product mix differences.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

As mentioned, fire insurance, where we have a 30% market share, has a commission of
27%. Car insurance, where our market share is more something like 15%, the commission
ratio is 16%. So we, of course, follow a bit the commission rates that are applicable in the
market.
But on costs, so the costs we control ourselves. There we are, on average, 1% to 3%
lower than the competitors. And again, we manage the non-life business based on the
combined ratio. So in some cases, you can reduce your costs by being less stringent, or
attentive, on underwriting in place management. But that 1% less costs can give you 3%
more loss ratio.
So we look to the combined result. And if, of course, one day we see that the prices are
going down, that losses are going up, and that costs make that we are not profitable, we
will have to look at other ways what we, for instance, do in some product lines where we
invest in IT, which is also embedded in our cost ratio, in order to be able to work more
efficiently in the future.

Q - Jason Kalamboussis

{BIO 4811408 <GO>}

Fair enough.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

And Asia, Hong Kong, I think the non-recurring, we referred to in the press release, for
last year was EUR8 million. So this year there's nothing non-recurring. So you could say
that something like EUR30 million on a yearly basis is quite reasonable in the current
context. And this is including the amortization of VOBA.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

I've just got a couple of questions left. Firstly, going to Belgium and looking at the level of
reserve releases, they've always been very, very, high. And obviously, this quarter, you've
had a one-off strengthening because of the VAT. But I was just wondering if you could
comment a bit about the trends there. How much of this is releases particularly of old
books are running off ? And how much is regular? If you could talk about trend there, that
would be great.
And, secondly, going back to the UK, and the integration of all of your brands now to be
underwritten by AIL, could you talk about what potential costs savings, or other benefits
you're going to have in your numbers, going forward? Thank you.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I think the reserves release in Belgium, if you compare to the UK, are indeed higher. But if
you look over time, they are relatively comparable and stable. It's not that you see big
hits[ph] unless some periods when there was, in most cases, an external event leading to
a strengthening of reserves.
Like this year, the decision on application of VAT on lawyer fees, which is, of course, for
the future business will be included in the pricing. But for the book of claims still under
management, it has had an impact, a one-off that has been in the Q3 figures. I think the
main reason you can see for a higher release is that the typical attitude in Belgium is to
have quite prudently reserves policies so that -- the market as a whole prefers to have
some included prudency compared to what we've previously seen in the UK.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

So it is a kind of proportionate[ph] effect, and after all in all, if you are in a steady state,
the whole year combined ratio is the same at the end, proportionate, because it means
that in Belgium you are a little bit more prudent on current year. And you have the relief
coming from the previous year, whereas you are closer to the expected cost of claims in
the UK whole years combined. But the whole year combined ratio is more or less the
same instead steady state[ph].

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

So you see no reason for that high level of contribution to the combined ratio from -there's no reason to change basically at all, going forward.

So I would say in the UK, the integration of the brands in AIL, so AIL, GICL, this is
something as mentioned going on where we have factors that the effects of the merger
will be more positive than the one we initially expected in the business case. We do not
really, to the outside world, quantify this. And I hope that we will be able to show this in
the cost ratio, going forward.

But just to ask, when you said the effects are more positive, you seem to be implying that
basic Groupama is doing really well in terms of profitability, but I'm just wondering, is part
of your comment to do with just synergies, basically?

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

No you have synergies on the two levels. You have, first of all, commercial synergies in the
sense that the product range has been widened, primarily more towards commercial
lines, and some very typical products that we did not have within AIL. So it means it
creates synergies in being able to offer a nicer portfolio of products and activities to the
dissolution channels we work with.
Besides that, of course, at all levels, there are synergies. I already talked about moving to
one building; having -- of course in everything which is support services you have
synergies. And also in IT there are synergies because you will have more volume on one
single platform. So what we also had to look at is, of course, and that's still in the figures,
so it will be positively affecting the future, a number of costs like, for instance, the
branding. Also informing all the clients about these changes. But this is one off, and we
expect that the positive synergies and the cost savings afterwards will be more than what
we initially integrate in our case when we offered for the price to buy Groupama.

Just coming back for a quick one. On the net cash position, in the past we have had
indications that about it was EUR900 million and a bit above EUR1 billion. But there was a

buffer capital or net cash that you wanted to keep at Group level and that was in general,
given litigation, so far you have had in general mostly positive developments. But it's
something that you had indicated that you would like to have.
Is it fair to assume that you continue to think this way; that means that you do want to
have a net cash position of about EUR1 billion and a bit, and, therefore, that the M&A that
we could think about, it's something that's certainly not any more a bolt-on acquisition, but
that it is within that limit, if you want.
And the quick second one is, do you -- are we likely to see in Asia, irrespective of you
going to new market, another capital, more capital going into your Chinese partner in the
Fourth Quarter, like we saw in the beginning of this year, the EUR77 million?

Okay, the first question. We probably were not clear in the past, but I think that we never - I not only think I'm sure, we never communicated any amount that we see as a buffer
capital for litigation. The only thing we said in the past, and what we keep saying, is that
we will always look to be, as well for solvency reasons, as for liquidity reasons, try to be in
a position where we keep our hands free and can be flexible in primary targets which is
further building and construct this Group. So there is no amount; there never has been an
amount dedicated to whatsoever specific use.
For Asia, okay, it is clear on one hand that we also indicated that you want to invest in the
future more shareholders' equity in the growth markets. Also with the volume growth and
to follow profit growth in China, it is not excluded that there will be a moment where
additional capital has to be injected in China, as we did in the beginning of this year. But
there is no timing; we will see how the business evolves in that region.

One; our nine month results confirm the positive trends that we observed in the previous
quarters. Two; I see progress in all important KPIs across the segments, and certainly in
those for which we have set targets at the recent investor update. And three; our focus
and challenge is to maintain this performance and to further improve, where possible,
taking into account, however, the challenges we have in certain of our markets.
Please do not hesitate to contact our investor relations team should you have outstanding
questions. Thanks for your time. I wish you a very good day. Goodbye.
