MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the conference call for the Ageas' Six Months Results
2014. I am pleased to present Mr. Bart de Smet, CEO; and Christophe Boizard, CFO. For
the first part of this call, let me remind you that all participants will remain on listen-only
mode, and afterward, there will be a question-and-answer session.
I would now like to hand over to Bart de Smet and Christophe Boizard. Gentlemen, please
begin.

Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you all for dialing in into this
conference call and for being with us for the presentation of the first half 2014 results of
Ageas. As usual, I'm joined in the room by Christophe Boizard, our CFO. And I also
welcome Filip Coremans, our new Chief Risk Officer since the first of July. He was
formerly our CFO and CRO in Asia. Furthermore, we also have Antonio Cano, the CEO of

FINAL

AG Insurance, in the room. And of course, our Investor Relations team is present as
always.
Ladies and gentlemen, the first six months of this year have definitely been marked by a
few rather exceptional weather-related events. The storms and the floods hitting the UK
badly in the first quarter received quite some press coverage. But also in the second
quarter, severe hailstorms left their mark on Belgium, causing a significant cost. This type
of events are typically moments where our customers want to be helped immediately and
want to have professional and high-quality support.
In total, almost 50,000 families in UK and Belgium have been held by our colleagues. In
spite of the costs related to the adverse weather, our net insurance results came in above
last year's level, helped by very good Life results and the nonrecurring tax credits in
Belgium. So, all together, I'm pleased to say that the underlying trends are good and
should set the tone for the rest of the year. The historically high level of unrealized gains
on our fixed income portfolio has further driven up shareholder equity. And this has a
negative impact on our return on equity.

Bloomberg Transcript

Ladies and gentlemen, when browsing over the main headlines of the results announced
today, which you can find on slide 1 of the presentation, I would like to highlight a few
items. And Christophe will, as usual, provide more details afterwards.
First of all, the net insurance profit amounted to €340 million compared to €320 million
last year, with a strong second quarter net result of €195 million. The severe hailstorm
hitting Belgium in June led to a net impact on the result of some €25 million, which we
already reported at the end of June. The total weather cost, including the UK floods, is at
around €60 million in the first half-year.
At the same time, the net results benefited from the release of a deferred tax liability of
€23 million in Belgium. And we also realized higher capital gains compared to last year,
including the impact of some recalibrations of our fixed income portfolio in Belgium, the
latter two being elements you couldn't take into account for your consensus.
Secondly, the group combined ratio improved somewhat in the second quarter but
remained for the half year above 100% at 102%, with the adverse weather events having
a negative impact of 4.6%. The overall prior year releases decreased to 3.7% compared
to 4.4% last year.
Thirdly, Life overall operating margin improved to 85 basis points, driven by a very strong
margin on Guaranteed products of 99 basis points, while the margin on Unit-linked
products turned around 20 basis points in line which a trend since the end of 2013.
Fourth element is a group result that amounted to €31 million with a negative results in the
General Account of €309 million related to the further increase of the RPN(I) liability and
the €30 million legal provision related to the FortisEffect case period in The Netherlands.

FINAL

Fifth and finally, our shareholder's equity increased in the second quarter to €9.2 billion or
€41.11 per share, including unrealized gains of €2.2 billion, as already mentioned. I'm also
pleased as well to announce a new share buyback program, the fourth program in four
years, and I'm now on slide 2.
So the board of directors have decided to increase the size of the program to €250
million. This decision is, I believe, in line with our intention to deploy our net cash for
growing our business, and we do not find the opportunities that we meets our target to
continue our policy to return cash to shareholders.
I'm also pleased to report progress on the strategic front, which is slide 3 and 5 of the
presentation. In June, we acquired the remaining shares in the Portuguese Non-Life entity,
allowing us to further develop this business. While keeping an excellent relationship with
our local business partners and primary distributor with Millenniumbcp, we now have the
possibility to explore all the distribution opportunities allowing us to further strengthen our
market position.

Bloomberg Transcript

And today, we also announced two other transactions. In Italy, where we acquired jointly
with BNP Paribas Cardif, the remaining shares in UBI Assicurazioni owned by UBI Banca.
This transaction allows us to explore in Italy also other distribution opportunities which
should help to strengthen and expand the Italian business.
And in the UK, we agreed on the sale of our local UK Life business, Ageas Protect, with
total consideration of approximately €228 million. This decision fits within our focus in UK
on the Non-Life market and distribution. And there, we have considerable scale, and we
hold significant market positions.
And lastly, before handing over to Christophe, I would like to come back briefly on
adjustment we received last week in the so-called FortisEffect case. As you will have read,
the court concluded that the sale of the Dutch activities to the Dutch State should be
unaffected, but it also ruled that Fortis did not communicate correctly in connection with
this matter during the period of 30 September till 1st of October 2008. Meanwhile, we
have confirmed that we will launch an appeal with the Dutch Supreme Court, and that we
will constitute a provision of €130 million with respect to the period covered by this case.
I would now like to give the floor to Christophe for a more detailed look at the results by
segment before we move to Q&A. Christophe?

Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Thank you, Bart. Further (07:21) to Bart's opening remarks, I will provide you with some
additional comments on two things, the operating results by Insurance segment and the
General Account. I will not touch upon the investment portfolio as the situation is rather
stable there.
So, first, our Insurance operations, and I am on slide 7 of the presentation. Bart already
highlighted the net profit of our Insurance operations of €340 million. The Life net profit
Page 3 of 27

FINAL

increased by more than 40% amounting to €285 million. Strong results in Belgium and a
30% higher net profit in the non-consolidated partnerships were the main drivers. These
more than compensated for the lower results in Non-Life and Other amounting to €55
million against €128 million last year. This includes the €60 million of exceptional weatherrelated costs.
Furthermore, poor results in third-party liabilities in Belgium and some results
strengthening across the segments also explained the lower overall result excluding the
weather. Cost inflows grew by 10% to €13.8 billion, mainly in Life and driven by Asia and
Continental Europe. It had become almost a tradition that inflows in China, in Asia, and in
China in particular, show amazing growth path. And this year is no exception. The inflow is
up by 14% over the same period of last year. Inflows in Luxembourg also grew significantly,
driven by strong wealth management sales in Italy. As a result, inflows in Continental
Europe grew by almost 20%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Life Technical Liabilities and I am on a 100% basis here, so something similar to the
definition of the gross inflow. So this Life Technical Liabilities continued to grow and
amounted to €117.5 billion at the end of June, of which €72 billion in the consolidated
entities and €45.5 billion in the non-consolidated partnerships, the latter driven by the
continued growth of the business. In the consolidated entities, the higher liabilities relate
to, among others, the inclusion of the Fidea Group Life portfolio acquired in Belgium in
the second quarter, and the amount at stake is around €450 million.
If I move now to some specific comments by segment, the Belgian operation to start with.
So, I am on slide 8 now. So if – our Belgian operations reported a net profit of €193 million,
up 21% compared to last year, and with a net Life result of €186 million and a Non-Life
result of €6 million. The Life operating result increased by 18%, driven by a solid
investment results with higher capital gains on both equity and fixed income.
This resulted in a solid guaranteed margin of 98 bps, partly offset by a lower operating
margin on Unit-linked products of 27 bps, margin of 27 bps. The better net result was also
helped by higher financial result on the assets backing own fund and the release of
deferred tax liability, the latter amounting to €23 million, mostly allocated to Life.
As already mentioned, Non-Life suffered from the severe hailstorms in June having an
impact to net result, as already mentioned, of €24 million. It also suffered from the
adverse results in the Other segment caused by the aforementioned third-party liability
business line and this as a result of claims inflation and some changes in jurisprudence
that we have observed.
We have initiated pruning action on this portfolio and rate increases to help remedy the
situation. All these resulted in a combined ratio of 105.7% close to 100%, if we exclude the
adverse weather impact. On an adjusted basis, Motor and Household would actually have
performed very well with a combined ratio of 98.8% and 19.6%, respectively.
Gross inflows were down 3% with an increase in Guaranteed and a decrease in Unit-linked
sales. It is worth mentioning here the further reduction of the Guaranteed interest rate on
Page 4 of 27

Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity

our main products in Belgium as of the 1st of June. And we are now at 1.25%, and we had
1.50% before.

FINAL

Moving on to the second segment, the UK, so slide 9. We recall that the net profit of €32
million with a net result of €38 million in Q2, and recovering from the negative result in Q1,
we were at minus €6 million, this was caused by the storm and floods.
A strong Non-Life operational performance in the second quarter resulting in a combined
ratio of 95.5% led to a year-to-date combined ratio of 100.7%. Both Household and Motor
remained below 100% despite the first quarter weather with the underlying – and the
underlying were at 111.2%. Gross inflows increased by 5%, driven by a positive currency
impact.
In Motor, as this is of (14:57) some interest in the UK context, the average price declined
by 3.2% year-on-year comparing positively with the market. Finally, the net result in Other
Insurance amounted to €6 million, including a positive one-off of the same amount, €6
million, related to a legal settlement already reported in the first quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

In our third segment, slide 10 of our presentation, Continental Europe. The net result
decreased from €46 million to €37 million, taking into account the fact that last year
results included a capital gain of €9 million realized in Turkey in the second quarter. Now
you will remember that this capital gain was related to the sale of some building in Turkey.
The Life result of the region increased slightly, taking into account positive tax credit in
France in the first quarter and a higher contribution for the partnership in Luxembourg.
The Life operating margin on guaranteed products declined, but remained strong at 82
basis point, while the Unit-linked margin dropped to 17 basis point. This – we have same
thing – it is like in Belgium; this is in line with the previous quarters.
In Non-Life, the operating performance in Turkey deteriorated due to a higher amount of
claims and reflected in a higher combined ratio of 99.8%. You will also remember that last
year, Non-Life result benefited from the capital gain realized on real estate in Turkey, and
already mentioned, but it benefited Non-Life.
Lastly, Asia, last segment. So, I am on slide 11 now. Too many items. The net result up by
19% and inflows up by 14%. So, two positive pieces of information. The net profit grew,
especially in Life, plus 25%, becoming plus 38% at constant exchange rate with a good
operational performance in all the non-consolidated partnership, but especially China and
with higher net result from Hong Kong, driven by higher capital gains. The Non-Life result
was marginally down because of slightly lower realized gains and with a combined ratio of
89.1%, which is absolutely excellent.
Inflows grew by 22% at constant exchange rates, with higher sales mostly coming from
China and Thailand. In both countries, we are benefiting from the significant efforts to
develop our agency channel as evidenced by a jump of new business through these
channels by more than 30%. Renewals were also up by almost 20%. And finally, the mix of
regular versus single premium business also moved further in the right direction.

FINAL

This brings me to the General Account on slide 12. As already indicated, we continue to
suffer from an increasing RPN(I) liability, influenced by the market price of the CASHES.
The total increase year-to-date amounted to €157 million, of which, €53 million in the
second quarter. The liability stood at €527 million at the end of June.
The net cash position decreased to €1.6 billion. The main reasons for this decline are the
share buybacks, as you can imagine, and the amount is €103 million, and the fact that
some upstream dividend will be received later this year, whereas the full dividend paid to
our shareholders was already paid at the end of the period.
The provision now, as already announced by Bart, we have also decided last week to
constitute a provision of €130 million for the litigation. This amount is based on the
assessment of the terms of the court's decision and on method and assumption
commonly used in the market. This amount has been reviewed by our auditors.
Slide 13 and 14, respectively, provides you with the traditional overview of shareholder's
equity and solvency. And realized gains on our investment portfolio increased by almost
70% in the first half up to €2.2 billion, part of them are restated (20:44) in the Life
Technical reserve. And the impact on shareholder equity is €945 million. You would
remember that in the change in shareholder equity, the unrealized – the change in
unrealized capital gain and losses is restated with non-controlling interest and their
corresponding taxes.

Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to end my comment here, and to hand over to Frank.

Frank Vandenborre

{BIO 15168443 <GO>}

Thank you, Christophe. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the introduction. And as
usual, we open now the lines for questions. As we have a lot people on the phone, we
insist on limiting to three questions by person, and by preference, two questions. Thank
you.

Q&A
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, we are ready to take your questions. And our first question is from
Ashik Musaddi from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Hi. Thank you. This is Ashik Musaddi from JPMorgan. Just couple of questions. I mean, in
terms of deciding a buyback of €250 million, why can't there be a bit of higher number
because it looks like you're generating more cash from disposal of (22:23) as announced
this morning as well? And your dividend that you have been receiving from subsidiaries
has been pretty strong, as well as flagged that (22:30) the full year results? So, any
thoughts on that?
Page 6 of 27

FINAL

And secondly is how comfortable are you with the €130 million of provision that you have
set aside for the litigation? Just – (22:43) any thoughts on that? And thirdly, with respect to
underlying improvement in Belgium, 98 basis point, can you remind us of the target? And
are you still comfortable with this 98 basis point of this quarter or should we be thinking
around 90 basis point which you have guided in the past? Thank you.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay, Ashik. Thank you for your questions. I'll answer on the first; and the third, potentially
with some help from Antonio, and Filip will take the second one. The first one, I think with
respect to the buyback, first of all, you can imagine that the fact that we launched a
buyback, the amount, and the period over which we do it is something that's always a
result of a lot of reflections, also a lot of discussion internally with management and
ultimately with the board. And that we thought that in, let's say, looking to, on the one
hand, our strategy where we each time repeat that we want to keep some flexibility for
insurance development, so, M&A on one hand; and secondly, not staying too long with
too much cash that is not yielding a lot on our accounts, that we try to find a fair balance.

Bloomberg Transcript

And we're of the opinion at the end of all these, let's say, reflections that a higher amount
than last year – slightly higher was justified. On the other hand, we also did not see the
real, let's say, necessity to increase this amount, particularly at this stage. So, that's the
reason why we came to this €250 million. And of course, the disposal of UK Life is a
surplus in terms of cash-in. On the other hand, we have this cash-out, for a limited
amount, of course, in Italy, some €40 million, and we will continue in moving forward with
each time assessing all possibilities.
Filip, you take the second one?

A - Filip Coremans

{BIO 17614100 <GO>}

Yeah. Okay. Ashik, thanks for that question which is not unexpected obviously given the
circumstances and events over the last weeks. Allow me to elaborate a little bit your
question by trying to give some color on why so many figures float in the market and
where and how we came up with the €130 million from our end (25:20). So, of course, it's
also and always a challenge to quantify this type of claims, and hence, therefore, we have
so far refrained from it.
But in the context of this ruling, the ruling is very, very specific. And so, the first
observation maybe is that this provision is recognized specifically for the alleged effective
communication covered in the FortisEffect case, and actually the FortisEffect case period.
So, this may in itself already be a difference between some figures floating in the markets
and on our provision of €130 million.
So, obviously, since we are a listed company and we are bound by strict criteria when we
may quantify estimates such as this, we did not make up our mind overnight. We studied
this for quite some time. We have looked very carefully through what type of methods –
assumptions have been used in other court cases. We studied what has happened in

Page 7 of 27



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2014-08-06

FINAL

litigation cases in the U.S., and in fact, also in a few cases in the Netherlands. So, this is not
on thin ice.
The most important assumptions that we make, and then without going obviously into the
details and the figures, but the most important assumptions that we have to make when
we make provisions like this relate to first and foremost an estimate of the number of
shares. And I don't mention shareholders, but the shares who qualify or are eligible for
damage. And there, I'll come back to that in a second. But that is one important
assumption we have to make.
The second one is obviously the relative performance of the share over that period
because – and also there, I'll come back immediately because that period was very
volatile, not only for Fortis at that time, but for many of its peers. And obviously, there
were a lot of contaminating factors. And not to say the least, the events which evolved
(27:30) after the week that is covered by the arrest. The nationalization by the Dutch
state, let's say, over the Dutch activities of Fortis is not something that in the period of
miscommunication we feel that our representatives at that time could have been aware
of. And so, that is definitely a contaminating factor, which falls beyond the scope of what
we think is included in there.

Bloomberg Transcript

And finally, another important dimension is the number, the percentage of eligible
claimants who then effectively will claim. Also, there we have looked at past cases, what
are the average statistics on that. So, this type of assumptions have been included.
Now, we have not done that in Ivory Tower. We have been in contact with, first and
foremost, some experienced outside parties who have built models and have been
elaborating on these matters for us. We have (28:36) by other and external independent
consultants to make sure that we have proper model validation on that. We had obviously
– and that is in the context of the approval of our annual or semi-annual accounts, we had
a discussion with our auditor who has given his consent to the way we have come up with
this provision. We discussed it with our legal advisors both internally and externally. We
have a lot of work lately.
So, as far as we can see, we think that this is a fair estimate. What we do not know
obviously is how all our counterparts come up with their numbers. But to summarize, we
believe that we have a fair estimate at this moment based on what I just said. We also
believe or we know actually that maybe three main reasons lie at the basis why you see
so many other estimates float in the market. And I can maybe elaborate on that also
because the question which otherwise probably (29:43) by the next participant. First and
foremost, as I said, we only provided here for the effects – FortisEffect period. So, it is the
ruling and the period covered by it. So, we just not include the other popular periods, let's
say, the AFM I and AFM II ruling periods.
Secondly, we have been looking at this previous – or should I say, court cases and
settlements of similar nature and how the claims there have been substantiated. They
have mainly been substantiated by appointing towards the traders rather than the holders
of shares. And this is something that we have also taken into account. What we mean with

Page 8 of 27



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2014-08-06

FINAL

that is we think that predominantly, those claimants who have bought the share at an
inflated price or a price inflated or upheld by the miscommunication actually an alleged
right to claim.
Let it be that we have standstill to determine damages. But that is the only shares that we
have taken into account, so we do not assume that we have to pay every shareholder. We
think there is something a normal shareholder who takes his normal risk when he invests
in a share. Also, they would – if we would have note that miscommunication, these effects
would have been in the price immediately. So, you know the reasoning. I think you are
probably as familiar as we are with this type of disputes.

Bloomberg Transcript

And finally, the third effect, which obviously leads to quite significant differences
sometimes with figures you see in the market is the arithmetics of what is – I would say,
how they come up with the claim per share. As I said, there is other movements in the
markets in that period than just, how should I say, the effects of the Fortis
miscommunication.
So, we had a very volatile market. Other companies were going under, so the normal
market trends have volatility in that market, of course we have incorporated that as a
factor in determining the claim size per share. And as I said before, let's be realistic when
we look at what transpired in the week after the three days, so after the 29th, the 1st, and
the 30th, that we come into the weekend where everything was hit with a reset button
where the Dutch state and all of the states, in fact, started to look at their own turf, when
the nationalization of the activities in the Netherlands happened, and hence, we do not
think and we don't feel that this is entirely something that the – how should I say, the Fortis
management at that time was -- be responsible for.
Now, this is, I think as much as we can share on how we have come up with the provision. I
just want to say it is not something that we did as I sat overnight, and we have obviously
very, very – well okay. We did our homework, I would say.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

(33:01)

A - Filip Coremans

{BIO 17614100 <GO>}

Maybe, shortly the – sorry?

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

No, just saying thanks a lot. That's really a very clear answer. It's been a very clear answer.

FINAL

And very detail one as well. Just one follow-up, you just mentioned, and just to be clear,
you mentioned you are mainly looking at the traders, given those miscommunication
period and not every holder; so for example, had been – if one person has been holding
for one year, you would not have considered that shareholder, right? So, just to be clear
on that one, yeah.

A - Filip Coremans

{BIO 17614100 <GO>}

Well, to be 100% clear and transparent, we do not mean day traders. We mean people
who bought, so traded in the share or bought shares at an inflated price and only sold
after the moment that we feel the effects of miscommunication were fully incorporator or
out of the market. Yeah.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. Then maybe to give also room for other people to ask questions, Ashik. The
shorter response on your third question, so in Belgium, it's clear, of course, that capital
gains are not equally spread over the years. You can have – (34:06) we have this half year
some cap gains on bonds because of our opportunities.

Bloomberg Transcript

The second element is that profit sharing over the year in terms of provisioning can move,
which means that we are quite confident that we will have by the end of the year a margin
that is in the range 85 to 90 basis points which is our promise. If for better, we will do
better. And also, don't forget that for new business, as Christophe mentioned, we each
and (34:36) lower the guarantee if market circumstances change. And so, that also helps
us protect and guarantee the margin we are striving for.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks a lot. That was very clear. Thank you for this.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

If you want to quantify the one-off, they can be estimated at 15 bps. So, if you deduct 15
from 98, you are well in the range. And so, (35:03) but on 12 months at the end of the
year, we will be comfortably within our range of the (35:14) of 85 to 90 bps.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Okay. Well, thank you.

Operator
Thank you very much. And moving on to François Boissin from Exane BNP Paribas. Please
go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - François Boissin
Yes. Thanks very much. Good morning, everybody. I have two – let's say, three questions
at this point. The first one really is on lit (35:36) risk. Again, you said you just provided for
Page 10 of 27

FINAL

the FortisEffect case. I just wondered when – if and when you would have more visibility on
the other claims which, presumably, are quite similar to the FortisEffect one? So, that's
question number one. Second question on the Italian JV, you said initially that it would
open up new growth opportunities. I wondered what those were. Please provide a bit
more details on that. And the third question on the UK disposal, can you highlight what
you intend to do with the cash remitted at the holding? Thank you very much.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. Filip, you start with question one.

A - Filip Coremans

{BIO 17614100 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, Bart, I will. So, actually, your question is why did we provide for the FortisEffect case
and not for all the cases? And why do we try to validate one and not the others? So, first
and foremost, I think under IFRS, you know the rules. More likely, they're not in a reliable
estimate. The first step is smooth (36:45). The other cases are, and that this I think the
most important thing, are in their very early stages. So, we're not in appeal. We cannot
measure. We don't have a specific period, et cetera, et cetera.
So, the second thing is that – so, these cases, it is not only – we have not been completed.
We were at early stages. They may be very distant in time and they relate to completely
different events. So, one, for instance – one set relates to the AFM I period. Another set
relates to the AFM II period, meaning the disclosure when the capital raising happens in
(37:40) that was the AFM I period, just to be sure, that was in May and June of 2008, with
the communication regarding the solvency situation, where we have an administrative
fine, but where the periods and the movement of the share is rather limited. But we have
not been convicted in any of the disputes related to that.
The AFM II are contrary where the amount was actually more relevant or the period is
more important. That was the disclosure of subprime exposure is in the context of the
capital raising where the fine has been annulled. So, I think if we take all that together, I
think the reason is very clear. It is long but certain that we will be convicted, and yeah,
that's as much as I can say on it. So, there are positive and negatives in there, but we will
see where it goes.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Maybe as one point, Filip, is that indeed, this is the first time that there has been a
decision in an appeal, but also not only there has been a decision like in this case about
incorrect, misleading communication during three days, but there is also a link made to
the fact that Ageas might be entitled to compensate people who introduced a claim. So,
there is a link made towards compensation.
Of course, each of the claimants will have to show that, indeed, he has suffered
damages, and the damages have to be estimated. So we consider that that's sufficient to
say it's more likely than not in IFRS terms to set up a provision. We've acted in a prudent
approach. And okay, going forward, this is a reflection, we will have to make at every

moment when something happens in this litigation portfolio, let's say. And that's I think the
main conclusion. Second...

Q - François Boissin

FINAL

Okay. Maybe just a follow-up on this, what is the timeframe – what is the best estimate of
the timeframe you're looking at?

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Let's say, and it's a – of course, it's not mathematical error (39:53). We believe that
whatever claim before there will be a decision. It will take one year-and-a-half, two years,
and it's clear that then, one or the other party will appeal, so it will not be in the first years.

Q - François Boissin
Okay. Thank you.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

Then the JV in Italy, so I think what we – when we talk about new opportunities in Italy, it is
that as of now, we are in full control together with Cardif of this legal entity and also the
whole infrastructure, so we will roll out, and it will start quite rapidly to third parties,
including BNP in Italy, so BNL and its subsidiaries. And we also look to other banks in Italy
to provide them with Non-Life insurance cover. So, the first ones will be BNL in domestic.
Then, the UK Life disposal, as mentioned in the press release, it's about an amount of
above €220 million; €228 million to be precise. A part of it will be used to pay back debt.
It's something like a bit more than €30 million. There are, of course, costs for the
operations. And the resulting amount will be upstream to Ageas.

Q - François Boissin
Okay. And maybe just lastly, does the regulator have a say on your buybacks in light of
bigger risk or where does the Belgian regulators stand on this issue?

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Well, if you look to the announcement on the buyback, you – and that's what we also did
the previous times and what we are expected to do and even that with the UK Life
disposal and JV in Italy or the operations in Portugal, we are in quite close and regular
contact with the Belgian regulator, meaning that we, every X months go with them
through what could be considered strategic decisions. The National Bank always asks the
board's – management and board to give an assessment whether a decision is strategic
or not, and then gives its approval.
So, the previous buyback programs have been approved by the National Bank. And also,
now we informed them quite in time, orally and also officially now, about this operation
with the message that Ageas board consider this a non-strategic operation in the context
of – for this non-strategic in the Belgian legislation. As a non-strategic would be, for
Page 12 of 27

instance, an acquisition of €2 billion, or a merger, or a very huge disposal. But we don't
expect any issues from that side. Of course, the two other operations, Italy, UK, they are
both subject to local regulatory approval, and that's – let's be clear on that.

Q - François Boissin

Thank you very much. And moving on to Albert Ploegh, ING. Please go ahead. Your line is
open

Q - Albert Ploegh

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Good morning, all. Yeah, three questions from my side as well. First one on the
upstream of dividends in the first half, if I take out the Millennium transaction basically, it
was around €235 million. Last year, on a full year basis, if you adjust for the leverage
impact mainly on Belgium, it was around – total of €440 million. You do mention indeed
further upstreaming to be expected in the second half. What is your best guess at this
stage? Will it be similar basically to the claims of (43:42) €440 million last year or could
even be a little higher than that? That's the first question.
The second one is, yeah, on M&A and disposals. Yeah, can you give some color on, let's
say, on the pipeline of potential – how deals – is there anything significant in the pipeline,
as you might have mentioned in the past? I take from – no comments so far that is not
immaterial. And also, on the decision for the UK, are there any other areas that might be
potentially refute as well? I'm thinking of, for example, France. Can you maybe give some
comments?
And finally, yeah, coming back to the legal angle again, FortisEffect (44:28) I think also on
the Dutch side (44:31) that they are open for any form of settlement? I know it's still fairly
early stages, but now you have basically set yourself provisions how you're comfortable
on the way you calculated it. Is it feasible that you will indeed enter in discussion before,
let's say, really the (44:50) case on the conversation starts? That's all my questions.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Christophe will take the first one.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Okay, I can start with the dividend because, as I said in the presentation, in introductory
comments, so there is a decrease in the cash position, which is partly explained by the
difference between what we paid in excess of €300 million and what we received. So,
two elements. First, Ageas, or the main contributor, paid slightly less than last year in term
of payout ratio. Last year it was 75%. This year, we accepted 50% payout ratio. And this
was aimed at strengthening the capital position of Ageas, which is slightly, and I will insist

Page 13 of 27



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2014-08-06

FINAL

on this, slightly below the 200%, the group objective. And since we had no stress on the
liquidity, we accepted this payout of 50%. That's the first element.
The second element, about what will happen in the second part of the year. So, as
already mentioned, we are waiting for some dividends. And to give you a precise
example, I don't want to be extremely precise, but the UK didn't pay dividends at the end
of June. And dividend coming from the UK is expected in the second half of the year, and
the amount is rather significant. So, all in all, what I have in mind is that in the second part
of the year, i.e., we will receive something like €100 million as incoming dividend.

Q - Albert Ploegh

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

To be clear, on China, basically, there's basically still I guess no dividends or injection
foreseen?

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

No. So, two things. First, as regard capital increase, there is nothing anticipated for this
year, so nothing. On the dividend, you remember I think I explained this last time for the
so-called state-owned enterprise, there is a kind of new rule which states that at least
10% of the profit has to be paid as dividend, which means that out of China, dividend will
come. But the amount is rather small. It is in the range of €5 million to €6 million, so
something small.
But then, you may argue that due to the fact that it's a fast-growing entity, obviously what
we receive will be given back through an increase of capital in the coming years by the
same amount. But please (47:40), nothing this year. On China, a small dividend, but frankly
as the back half is more increasing, the means of the entity, this will be reimbursed, if I can
say, in the following years. So, that is the situation.

Q - Albert Ploegh

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Good. And the second question and I will be short. Pipeline disposals or M&A, we – it's
always the same question – response, sorry for that. We look to opportunities that fit with
our strategy. I think we took these two opportunities in Portugal and Italy to improve or to
strengthen our position, knowing that we know these markets and we see possibilities to
be profitable in these markets.
UK, we have been able, I would say, in a quite serene context, not too much surrounded
(48:31) in the market to come to a correct deal. I think the buyer, AIG, has the intention to
re-enter that market, has seen the quality of our entity, the quality of our people. And so,
for them, it's a win. For us, it's a win because it was not of high strategic priority for us and
not really fitting in our activities in UK.

Page 14 of 27



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2014-08-06

So, this is the way we intend to go forward, is to look selectively where we can buy or
increasing or decreasing or buying something. Go more to the profile we are looking for,
and also of course, by doing so, increase our return on equity. But making public
statements about maybe other entities we are looking for disposal would not benefit the
operation, and so, we prefer to stay quite discreet on that.

FINAL

The last one, Filip?

A - Filip Coremans

{BIO 17614100 <GO>}

Yeah. Okay. Obviously, as a company, we have to balance the interest of all our
stakeholders. And so, if an opportunity comes up to have a sensible discussion with a
party to discuss potential settlement of this type of dispute, which obviously reduce the
volatility around our share and uncertainty around our company, we would always talk and
look at it. But so far, of course, it takes two people to talk. So, (49:58) the fact that you
mentioned that (50:01) claim would be interested to talk to us, they have for sure not
spoken to us about this yet. But if that were to happen, we will consider that, but with the
best interests of our shareholder (50:13).

Q - Albert Ploegh

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And maybe one follow-up question on the legal side. If you, as a shareholder, basically be
represented by the FortisEffect (50:23), do you then give up your shareholder rights also
to claim under the – let's say, for example, the Dutch VEB case. It doesn't work like that. So
then you cannot get compensation twice, basically, if and if the periods are different?

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Yeah. That, I cannot comment upon like that. But of course, under that, I can just say that if
we were to look at settlements, and that is an important in that context, of course, we
would like to look at full and final settlements, and not something that is hanging there in
midair so that we can claim again. So – but that is logic.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

But I think it's also quite obvious that you can only – if we are compensated for a proven
loss, you can only be paid once, of course, for the same thing. That seems quite evident.

FINAL

Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2014-08-06

Yes. Good morning. Two questions, please. Just to come back on the litigation, if I may, I
understand that it's the relative performance of the shares, which matters in setting any
compensation. But what might be the timeframe to analyze such relative performance
versus peers? I understood it should be quite long, possibly even up to the moment of
any verdict in proceedings dealing with compensation. So, if that would be correct, then
the damages suffered would be quite limited, considering the points you mentioned that
the banking index also went down quite significantly. So, could you provide your view on
this and whether or not that reasoning now would be correct?
And then a second question regarding the UK disposal. I have difficulty in reconciling the
gross with the net proceeds. You mentioned gross proceeds of €228 million and net of
€33 million. Was the delta explained by the internal loan? How big was that internal loan
and what this accounted for as an IFRS liability? And will you then – will you therefore
benefit from book value increase or any improvement in the deployable capital on top of
what the €33 million net proceeds would suggest? Thank you.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Starting with the second question, I think the gross amount is indeed the amount that has
been mentioned, that's the sort of €228 million. The €33 million for the sub debt is a sub
debt that was accorded by the UK group, so it goes back to the group there. And at that
moment, the remaining amount is free to be upstreamed after, of course, some costs for
the whole operation, bankers, legal advisers, and so on. So it means that, you could say
that there's something like €190 million to €200 million that will flow back to the General
Account.

Q - Matthias de Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

Okay. Sorry, I thought it's €33 million referred to net proceeds, so it's in fact referring to
the cost. Yeah. Okay. It's clear. Okay.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

And then, so you can also estimate that the cap gain is something slightly above €20
million.
The other question, I think on the timeframe and relative performance, it's quite complex.
And we also want to avoid to have dull (54:09) reasoning in public. This is something we
will bring up in court if we are at that stage.
We have made our assumptions. We'd say not on easy mathematics of paying share price
or stakes at the end. It was why the difference is so much. And so, this is what the claimant
could claim. We have quite sophisticated matters and I'm almost behind it. And be sure
that it's quite intense and detailed (54:43).

A - Filip Coremans

{BIO 17614100 <GO>}

Yeah. I think on the legal dispute, if I – this is Filip Coremans again, I may say. We have
disclosed I think a fair amount of information today. I don't think we should go, the interest
Page 16 of 27

also of our shareholders and our company in much more detail at this moment. Let it be
said that it is clear that this – though we have been convicted, the claimants still have to go
through individual procedures, and this may take up – one to two years to come up with
any quantification on these claims. So, it is a period, a process that will take some time.
And so, at this moment, we stick to the factual reading of what you can see in the arrest
(55:29) on which we base as we don't speculate on any long or short of periods. I think
this is what it is.

Q - Farquhar C. Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Morning, gentlemen. Just two questions from my side. I mean, firstly, obviously, thanks for
the kind of (55:53) help me trying to give us around the litigation provisions. Actually, my
questions still relate to that. Firstly, when you discuss the provision of €130 million, can you
just clarify whether that provision covers the underperformance due to – after the stock
suspension? So, that would be like almost the middle of October.
I'm just a little bit confused around some of the comments you made about time period.
And also, I get the impression you're making some other kind of adjustments within that
number, but just kind of understanding if you've gone all the way through the suspension
would be quite useful.
And then secondly, with regards to capital distributions and buybacks, what is the risk that
litigating parties object to these capital distributions? And have you made any expressions
of issues with the distributions you're making at the moment? And do they have any legal
routes to objecting to those? Thanks.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Permit me to answer quite shortly. I think the first one, I only repeat what Filip just said is I
think we have given quite some color about the big lines, how we came to this provision.
So, I believe also in the interest of the provision, we don't want to go more in the detail
that is clear. That's when we make a provision that is somewhere weighted average of a
number of potential or possible scenarios. That's one.
The second, whether there is a risk if litigation parties object against the buyback, okay,
we are in a democratic country. Everybody can do what he thinks he wants to do, and it's a
question that should be asked to them. In any case, both (57:30) parties should also take
into account that a lot of the clients that have opted to make use of them are current
shareholders. And I'm not sure that the current shareholders is that pleased with their

Page 17 of 27



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V

lawyer opposing something that is considered being in the interest of the company and
the current shareholders.

FINAL

Q - Farquhar C. Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Just a follow-up on that second question, and I mean, when you think about the amount
of buybacks you were doing, obviously, the €250 million is slightly higher than the year
before, does that have to balance the risk or perhaps (58:08)?

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

I can assure you that the decision or the preparation of decision of the buyback has been
taken before we were aware of the outcome of the FortisEffect case. So, we will continue,
in all seriousness, looking to all potential elements that, let's say, impact the company,
positive, negatively, to take the best decision in the interest of all stakeholders. So, I
would say, even without this case, we would, of course, have presented a buyback, and
I'm not sure that it would've been for a bigger amount.
Don't forget that our conviction is this €130 million provision is a prudent provision for this
case and the period that it relates to. So, we say this is an amount that, of course, we
have somewhat to ring-fence in our cash position. It's about €130 million. It's less than 2%
if I remember well of our shareholders' equity. We announced a buyback of €250 million.
These are not the amounts that fundamentally change the position of the company
related to all these elements.

Q - William H. Elderkin

{BIO 3349136 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Really just two follow-ups. Can we just – from the
way the provision (59:40) business has been booked, will that all – whatever happens in
the future, is that always going to be charged to the General Account where effectively
gross is net? In other words, there's not going to be any tax shield on a litigation costs?
How will those turn out to be? And then, completely differently, can you just give a sense
of what the capital gain in the Hong Kong business was and an idea of the extent to which
that is a one-off versus sustainable in nature?

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

And so, the provision in the General Account [by definition, I think the General Account is
in front of the top holding and since these litigations are done by fair holding, all the
provision and all the potential payments will be made out of the General Account. So
that's your first thing.

FINAL

As regard tax, there is – we already have huge past losses. So it means that there is no
relief coming from taxes. And so, gross amounts are equal to net amounts. That simple.
And then, as regards the capital gain in Hong Kong, the amount was not huge and it was
€4.5 million in the first six months in Hong Kong. And it was plus 3 (01:01:00) last year for
the same period. So, the increase is, I would say, negligible €1.5 million. We are – I like to
say that capital gain are not – were not – if you take some asset classes like equity or real
estate, there is no equity in Hong Kong, but equity, capital gain are business as usual.

Hello. Thank you. Hopefully I've got two quick questions. You commented briefly on this,
but can you just – the second quarter impact of weather on the Belgium combined ratio,
could you just clarify that number for me? And do you think the first half experience makes
you more or less comfortable in ultimately attaining the 97%?
And then secondly, (01:01:58) that I'd feel an idiot if I didn't also ask a question on
litigation risk. Am I right that in your roll forward of the net cash, you have not deducted
the €130 million charge you've just taken? And shouldn't, strictly speaking, you do that
because it seems pretty comfortable this is now encumbered cash in some way?

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

For first question, the gross impact of the reinsurance was €49 million, so net €24 million.
It has an impact of 5.5% on the combined ratio of Belgium for the first half of the year.
And if you would exclude the hailstorm, the combined ratio for Motor would have been
98.8%, and for Household, 90.6%. So, it means that if – A, what we expect in the second
half of the year is that we will move to a combined ratio in Belgium, that normally should
be below 100%.

Q - William S. Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Second question.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Yes. The second question, of course, there is no cash impact because there's no cash
outlay. And so, if there would be a cash outlay, then we probably have reached a
settlement. But otherwise, it will just be a provision like we have for RPN(I). So there should
not be a direct impact on our cash position.

Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V

Well, I suppose it, if I may follow up on that, begs the question of whether there are other
encumbrances on your cash that you're not recognizing in your net cash figure because
most people tend to assume that's a totally liquid figure.

FINAL

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

No, I think we always said in whatever communications that we look to the two elements,
solvency and cash, in such a way that we avoid to be one day in – what I would call, in
position to a solvency or a lack of liquidities. It means, that while we talk about the cash,
we always say that we will use it to further develop the group by acquisitions and/or give it
back to shareholders. But we also each time repeat it that we, in any case, will keep a kind
of a certain prudency level, which does not necessarily relate to litigation in order to be
not in short of cash one moment. We never disclose this amount. This is also something
that can move over time.
But for this case, you can say that we know that, let's say, the €130 million when we
provision it, it will not be a cash-out next year or the year after that because, as I said, we
don't expect this to be decided in the first two, three years. But in – on the other hand,
from a prudency point of view, we will have to take in account that maybe one day, there
will be this amount to pay if we are followed in appeal, probably no amount to be paid.
So, that's part of the prudent approach we have with respect to the cash.

Bloomberg Transcript

You also have the two other liabilities in General Account, the AG – the put option for AG
Insurance and RPN(I). Also there, one day, it could be that cash could be used to do the
one or the other way or to reduce the RPN(I), whoever knows.

Q - Benoît Pétrarque
Yes. Good morning, everybody. Just first question on Belgium Life, if I look at the pre-tax
profit in the second quarter, €160 million, then take out the cap gains of €51 million and
adjust for the impairments of €20 million, actual come to a very strong Q2, about €130
million pre-tax for Belgium Life, and we were more used to see around €100 million, €100
million. So is there any pre-tax level – is there any one-off specific items for – relating to
the Belgium Life business?
And then, could you talk about your margin on the new business? We have seen gross
inflows below the billion this quarter. But what about guaranteed rates going forward? Are
you able to lower them? And also, in your margin on this new business, could you talk a
little bit about that?

Page 20 of 27

And then, just to come back on the RPN(I) you just mentioned, do you have any intention
to come to a settlement? We have seen the price of the CASHES going up significantly.
So, it will have been a good deal to actually do a deal a couple of years ago. Now, it starts
to be expensive potentially. So, do you have that in mind currently? Thanks.

FINAL

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. So, the first question on what you do kind of underlying results for Belgium Life in
Q2. I think an element that you always have in the second quarter is the dividends that are
based (01:06:56) on the equity portfolio.
So, that's a bit – the investment income over the year is not equally spread, of course, as
the case for bonds and real estate. But you have done a dividend season in terms of cap
gains. We already commented previously that part of the cap gains comes out of real
estate operations. So you cannot spread them over the years. So, I think that's a bit more
the explanation for a strong Q2 after, let's say, taking out exceptional elements.
I believe that the main message of Belgium Life is that (01:07:30) and Christophe said
that we, in any case, have no indications that we will not be able to achieve over the year
a margin between 85 and 90 basis points.
Christophe?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Maybe on the profitability of new business, some element of context first. So, as I said in
the comment, we decreased the minimum guaranteed rate as of June 1. So, we are now
at 1.25%, but a way to address the low interest rates. Then, the other element to be
compared to this is the yield we obtained on new money during the first part of the year.
So the figures are the following. So, we've achieved 3.17% over the first six months. And
obviously, we have different figures for Q1 alone and Q2 due to the trend. So, we were at
€334 million in Q1, and €280 million in Q2.
So, at the end my comment is the following. We have the investment return on new
money, let's take Q2, €280 million, and the minimum guaranteed rate is 1.25%. So, it
means that we still have some room. But we have to be honest and transparent. This
business is under stress. And we cannot live for a very long period of time if the OLO, the
Belgian government bonds at 1.53% on 10 years. And then, in 10 years – in 10 years, I
should even take the eight years, which is even lower. So, we are well protected. You
know the fact that we have this much duration based off (01:09:29) a lot. And then
quarter-after-quarter, we have this good result. But the sector is under stress.

For new business. I said well covered on our existing book, but the new business is under
stress, even though we have still this margin between the €280 million I've mentioned
and the €125 million.

FINAL

Q - Benoît Pétrarque
But the €280 million, how do you make that? Because I mean, with the OLO at
somewhere between 1.5% and 1.8%. I mean, it should be a very big change in the mix
currently on the new production. I mean, you were used to invest most of your inflows – I
mean, the large part of your inflows in OLO, but how can you reach 2.8% with a similar
mix?

Bloomberg Transcript

We are not magician and we are not aggressive in the investment management. So, two
elements in my answer. First, as I said, the €280 million is the mean of our Q2. And frankly,
and to be perfectly transparent, I am expecting a further decrease in Q3 because the
trend is there. It's an average. And the latest week were the worst. So that's the first
element of answer. Then – but really this relates to asset management. Obviously, we
don't invest all our money in government bonds.
And I would say that the allocation in Belgian government bonds is very small on new
business. We invest heavily on corporate bonds. We play with the – we optimize the
duration. It's a better word. So, on govys, we tend to go longer on the curve, and we are
shorter on duration on the corporate bonds. But obviously, the yield on corporate bond is
much higher. And so, that's a mix of all. But my conclusion and coming back on the main
point, this 2.8% will go down. And we are trying to do our best with diversification, the
corporate bonds, the loans.
The loans we are still at something slightly below 4%. So, we are doing our best with this I
think good results so far. But again, for the book of business, I think important to underline
that the margin is secured further, even taking into account the investment risk. And that
for new business, where indeed interest rate (01:12:06) achieved goes down, we'll further
adopt the guarantee as we have done over the past two years, six times if I remember
well, and profit sharing.

RPN(I), Christophe?

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

On RPN(I), any intention to come to a settlement, we have – let's say, we pay continuous
attention to the RPN(I). But the thing is the following. It's two perpetual instrument. And
the real cash burden is extremely small, and you can read it in the different slide. It is – we
pay something like 1% or 1.1%. So, it is slightly above €5 million a year.
So, when you have a liability whose real cost – real perpetual liability with a cash outlay of
1.1% a year, a lot of motivation to settle. And I think we have to live with the volatility.

Having said that, that's a constant concern. And if we find adequate solution, obviously,
with the other parties, BNP Paribas, we will do it as soon as it makes sense on the
shareholders' standpoint.

Thank you very much. And moving on to Jason Kalamboussis from Société Générale.
Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jason Kalamboussis

{BIO 4811408 <GO>}

Yes. Hi there. Two quick questions. The one is from the expense ratio, you are mentioning
that it was – it has gone up notably because you continue to have the UK restructuring in
there. When are we going this – to see this changing? I thought that would – the second
half will see the expense ratio in the UK coming down. But also, when I'm looking at the
Belgium expense ratio, it's one of the highest we have seen. So, there is a clear
deterioration at group level. So, could you give the explanations in Q2? And what should
we expect going forward because clearly it is quite substantial for you to meet the ROE
target?
And the second thing is on the 2015 ROE target, what is your confidence in meeting the
ROE targets? Do you feel comfortable that you would be meeting your 2015 ROE target?
And do you have – with what element of unrealized gains, if something, you can share
with us? That would be great. Thank you very much.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay, the point one, expense ratio. First of all, expense ratio is a combination of costs and
commissions. Commissions are, in many cases, driven by, on one end, market
circumstances and market practice, but also the composition of your portfolio. To give a
clear example, we are in Belgium, primarily in the household market, where commissions
are above 27%. Commissions in motor insurance are 15%. If you balance your portfolio a
bit more to household, your expense ratio goes up. That's one.
Secondly, in each of the markets where we are, we try to – we check our cost ratios, which
is the cost we really have (01:15:51) at hand. We check them with the peers and see that
Page 23 of 27

FINAL

we take care of the fact that we are in the, let's say, in the top class in terms of the lower
cost ratios in that market.
Thirdly, we include in our cost ratios, which is not everywhere in every group, in every
market the case, all costs like for IT development, also (01:16:16) development. Most of
these are not spread over time. They are taken upfront in our cost. And that can also
temporarily that you remind yourself correctly, in UK where we are, for instance, reviewing
the – or restructuring the retail activities also, while we are in the aftermath of the group
(01:16:36) integration can have an impact.
Of course, we are aware of the fact that in the combined ratio target we've got, there is
not only the element of loss ratio but also expense ratio. So, in going forward, in order to
arrive at our 97%, which is our goal, which is (01:16:54), we have to take -to stay vigilant on
that part, and we will take the necessary actions when they are, let's say, needed or when
they are clearly necessary to be in line with competition.

Bloomberg Transcript

The second question was on the return on equity. If you look to return on equity with or
without the unrealized capital gains, and of course, the target we have set of 11% was the
one on the shareholders' equity, including the unrealized capital gains of 11%, we are not
at that stage. We are at 8.4%. If you exclude unrealized capital gains, we are at 10.7%. So,
the continued increase of the unrealized cap gains primarily in the Belgian portfolio is
certainly not helping.
But we continue to work toward this 11%. For instance, the divestment in the UK is clearly
an element of that. Trying to increase the scale and distribution in other markets is also an
element within that. We're working hard to get the combined ratio around the 97%, it's
part of it. So, we still have, I would say, 16 months to go.
We would, of course, be extremely helped by increasing interest rates, but don't expect
that to happen in the next quarters. You could say, for this year, if we would have excluded
the impact of weather and also, to be honest, the tax credit, we would already have been
slightly above 9%. With the operation of Protect, we would be more in the range 9.2%,
9.5%. So, I think this shows that we make progress. And of course, the end sum (01:18:46)
or judgment has to be made at the end of next year.

Q - Jason Kalamboussis

{BIO 4811408 <GO>}

Thank you. If I may just add one thing, do you find that – are you satisfied with your
Belgium expense ratio at this stage because when you look at some peers, the distance
with some peers has actually widened? So, on both sides, you have the weather events
which is something (01:19:10) to keep in mind. But specifically on the combined ratio with
peers, the distance seems to be widening, and it looks like expense ratio is where the
difference is.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. I propose to pass to Antonio, CEO of the Belgium operations.

Q - Antonio Cano

{BIO 16483724 <GO>}

FINAL

So on the widening, what's the combined rates compared to our peers, please bear in
mind that as Bart was saying that we are relatively large in Households. We have about
one-third of the Belgian households. So any weather-related events hurt us relatively
more than some others. That's on the claim side front. On the expense ratio, as Bart was
saying, it is combination of commission and operating costs.
If we just look at the operating cost, we do benchmark ourselves with our competitors.
There, we actually see an advantage in terms of cost ratio that we don't see decreasing.
So, we remain that advantage. When you see expense ratio going up, that has more to
do with our product mix, again more tilted towards the retail lines and the households
where commissions are higher. So you should try to adjust for the portfolio mix when you
compare expense ratios.
But again, if we look through that and just look at the costs there, we are today quite
satisfied. We can do more. Bear also in mind that we do still have a few large IT projects
on the way weighting on the cost ratio that we don't amortize all the time and we take it
immediately.

Thank you very much. And moving on to David Andrich from Morgan Stanley. Please go
ahead. Your line is open.

Q - David T. Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. My first couple of questions are on
the Life side, particularly with the Unit-linked margins. I was just wondering if you could
give a little bit of color on that and how those have developed through the year versus
last year. They seem be quite a bit lower, particularly in the Portuguese business. And then
second one, I was just wondering in the UK Non-Life market, it looks like you were able to
grow in terms of Motor of around 2%, while many of your peers have been shrinking due
to the rate declines. And you mentioned a new niche products which you haven't offered
(01:21:32) just wondering if you could maybe give a bit more detail on that. Thank you.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

So if I can (01:21:38) take this first one?

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Yes. On the margin of Unit-linked, so you are right. I'm sure we report disappointing
figures, disappointing in term of volumes and in terms of margin. On slide 7, we read that
the margin is up 20 bps, which is below what we have as a target. So, the element of
explanation: first, the unit-linked market has shift a little bit and the product which were
Page 25 of 27

FINAL

proposed were the so-called structural products where you give to the client guaranteed
on the capital, and this is built basically with zero coupon plus calls.
The fact that the rates are so low prevent you from having a sufficient margin when you
buy the zero coupon to buy the calls. So, it means that it is extremely difficult to present
attractive products to the client. Now, so the product design is very difficult. So it means
that since it was the main product offered, we are decreasing the volumes, and where
small margin is due is the direct consequence of the very low rates. And where to present
with still attractive product, we have to lower our margins. That's it on Unit-linked.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

It's also a phenomenon in the market. And so, the – although, the return clients can get on
savings accounts, on guaranteed business in Life, we do not see in Belgium, in Portugal a
strong take-up of Unit-linked, as we don't see it either in mutual funds in these markets.
The second question is the UK Motor. I think that's indeed you're right. On the one hand,
we see our volume going slightly up and the decrease of the rates lower than the market.
Okay, the main explanation is that we have increased the number of cars that we insure.
We are probably – that's a bit our prudent approach, also in segments where the price
sensitivity is a bit lower than in that categories where prices are really still far below the
normal levels. So, we continue to opt for a profitable growth, but the growth is not the
primary objective.

If there aren't any questions left, then we would conclude or ask Bart start to conclude.

Operator
There are no questions left from the audience. And with that in mind, I would like to return
the conference call back to Mr. Bart de Smet.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your good questions. And to end the call, let
me summarize very shortly the main conclusions. One, solid insurance result without the

FINAL

growing inflows and the net profit impacted by a number of one-offs, but in both
directions. The trend is up, and this is positive in the light of our targets. At the same time,
we are confronted with increasing unrealized gains, which are having a negative impact on
our ROE. But I think we primarily are confident or pleased with the fact that the net profit
on its own is increasing quarter after quarter.
Secondly, we reported the progress in a number of strategic files, which have structurally
enable us to have more capacity to develop our local activities in the case of Portugal and
Italy or to focus more and better on the most material part of our business as what is the
case in the UK. And lastly, we launched the fourth share buyback program, delivering on
our promise to return cash to the shareholder if we consider this to be the best
alternative use of cash.
Then I'd like to draw your attention to an Investors Dinner that we will organize in London
on Monday, the 29th of September, which is our annual report appointment with the
financial community. Contrary to the past years, we have no fixed company themes
(01:26:00) scheduled today, and therefore we opted for this formula, which is more
flexible, permits us to comment on a subject of actuality at that moment. It should also
allow management to have sufficient time to talk to all of you. For further information, you
can, of course, contact the Investor Relations team at any time.

And with these conclusions, I wish you all the best. And for those still having some holidays
planned, enjoy some time with your family, and we will be meeting soon. Thank you for
your time and goodbye. Bye.
