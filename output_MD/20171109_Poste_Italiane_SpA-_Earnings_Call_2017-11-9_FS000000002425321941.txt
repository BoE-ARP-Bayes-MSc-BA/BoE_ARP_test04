Bloomberg Transcript

Good day, and welcome to the Poste Italiane Nine Months 2017 Results Conference Call.
For your information, today's conference is being recorded.
At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Matteo Del Fante, CEO. Please
go ahead, sir.

Matteo Del Fante

{BIO 6237992 <GO>}

Thank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. We're pleased to report the results for
the ﬁrst nine months of 2017. Revenues for the period were up €524 million, 2% over last
year, reaching €26 billion.
EBIT in the ﬁrst nine months is equal to €1.176 billion, down €20 million or 2% from €1.196
billion of last year. I would like to emphasize the EBIT in the ﬁrst nine months of 2016 last
year result was impacted by the positive one-oﬀ eﬀect related to the Visa Europe disposal,
which accounted for €121 million and made the consolidation at the time of the BdM-MCC
bank activities for €30 million, while the nine months of 2017 EBIT has been impacted on
the opposite by some accruals related to real estate funds posted in the Financial
segment.
Net of this non-ordinary eﬀect, our nine months 2017, we call it normalized EBIT would
have been €1.237 billion versus the €1.045 billion of last year, posting an increase of more
than 18%.

FINAL

Net proﬁt is down €83 million versus last year, which is 10% to €724 million, mainly as a
consequence of the already mentioned accrual, plus the Alitalia write-oﬀ for around €70
million impacting the tax level. Excluding the above mentioned one-oﬀ eﬀect, also the net
proﬁt would have been higher at €839 million with an increase of 25% versus the €672
million posted last year.
In the presentation today, we will start introducing some new KPIs and items that allow the
management and the stakeholders and investors to follow the deployment of the new
plan of next year. And clearly, we'll go more into the details of this new KPIs.
Moving to slide number 3, the Financial Services, the ﬁrst segment, posted revenues
down by 3%, because in 2016, we had Visa capital gain and the BdM-MCC bank
consolidation. And again, net of this eﬀect, the ﬁrst nine months of 2017 results would
have been up 0.6% versus last year.
Operating proﬁt decreased by €99 million, minus 14%, mainly due to the lower revenues
that we describe and the negative impact of the €50 million provision for the real estate
fund. Net of the non-recurring items, the ﬁrst nine months of 2017 EBIT would have been
€666 million, which would have been up 2% versus €651 million of last year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Insurance and Asset Management revenues increased by €700 million or 4% versus last
year in terms of revenues from €18.7 billion to €19.5 billion and operating proﬁt posted a
robust 28% growth year-on-year. This is mainly due to the ongoing positive performance
of life written premium and initial contribution on non-life and asset management
products.
On the last segment, Mail and Parcels, revenues were down €68 million, minus 2.5% to
€2.66 billion. The expected reduction mainly related to the decline in traditional Mail
volume, partially compensated by the increase in parcel revenues that we will explain
better later on.
In the ﬁrst nine months of 2017, EBIT is down versus last year, due mainly to lower
intersegment revenues, so it's the ﬂip side of the reduction revenues that we have seen in
the Financial Services, as we will describe more in detail in the following slides.
Moving to our total assets under management. We posted an increase from the end of
2016 in nine months of €12 billion, up 2.5% versus the €493 billion of end of 2016. The mix
continues to be well balanced. We experienced a slight reduction in postal savings,
collection and a signiﬁcant increase on our current account deposit and in fund and net
technical reserves.
As you can see from 2014, we conﬁrm our growth path in total asset under management
or administration. These remarkable results underline the strength and reliability of our
brand and our networks. The proximity to our customer base, as well as of the range of
simple and safe products is really appreciated by our clients.

Let me now hand over to Roberto Giacchi, Group CFO, that will go into detail of every
speciﬁc business segment. Thank you.

Roberto Giacchi

{BIO 20101579 <GO>}

Thank you, Matteo and good afternoon, everybody. Let's now move into each speciﬁc
business unit results. Starting from our Financial Services revenues evolution on slide
number 5. As you all know, BancoPosta business model is similar to asset gathering and
supported by transaction banking and distribution of third-party products. Our revenues
overview, as a consequence, follow the structure. Overall, in nine months 2017, we're
down revenues by 3.1% versus prior year. For the same period, normalized revenues, net
of MCC and Visa eﬀect, were up by approximately €23 million or plus 0.6% year-on-year.
In October, we had also experienced a recovery in the distribution revenues.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let's now look into each speciﬁc segment, moving on to slide number 6. On current
account deposit, let me point out the following major items. An increase in average
deposits of BancoPosta accounts moving to €55 billion from €49 billion in 2016, up 13%, a
stable customer base with over 6.3 million current accounts, a decrease in net interest
income for €35 million versus nine months 2016, more than compensated by the increase
in posted capital gains.
On 7 November, unrealized capital gains reached almost €3 billion, mainly as a
consequence of the spread decrease. I can conﬁrm that for full year 2017, we expect to
generate returns on current account deposit in the region of €2 billion, as a combination
of capital gains and portfolio yield. Within this framework, please note that in the ﬁrst half
of the year, we have realized all the capital gains expected for the full year.
Let's now move to postal savings in the following slide. Up to the end of September 2017,
average postal savings deposits decreased by minus 1.6%, and the related fees remained
almost stable at €1.172 billion. At the end of May, we widened our product oﬀering with a
three-year postal bonds, with a nearly gross return of 0.7% and this has strongly
contributed to improve net inﬂow in postal bonds in the third quarter 2017. At the end of
the ﬁrst nine months 2017, we can count on a very stable customer base, with over €30
million of postal savings books.
Let's now move to the transaction banking on slide number 8. Here, we are introducing
some of the new KPIs that Matteo mentioned at the beginning, which should enable you
to better understand the key drivers of our transaction banking business. The cards and
acquiring business has accounted a very solid growth both in terms of cards and
transaction value. This is deﬁnitely a growth area both in terms of revenues and margins
for our group in the future.
To this respect, I would like to mention the continuing success of Postepay Evolution card
that, in the ﬁrst nine months 2017, has more than 4.8 million cards issued from the launch
in July 2014, with around 1.2 million cards in the ﬁrst nine months of 2017.

FINAL

The payment bank and money transfer business has registered a decline in payment slips
minus 3.7% and the growth in bank and money transfer transaction 4.4%.
Let's now have a look to the transaction banking revenues on slide number 9. Here you
can see the revenues related to the key drivers I described in the previous slide, are
slightly growing year-on-year, in particular, the reduction in payment slips for €39 million
has been more than oﬀset by the increase in the cards and acquiring business for €42
million.
Let's move now to slide number 10. Allow me to take this opportunity to introduce you
and highlight the extremely positive achievements we reached so far in our digitalization
process. At the end of September of this year, we had 14.2 million registered users, plus
2.6 million or plus 22% versus September 2016 while in terms of mobile apps we
recorded 13.3 million downloads, plus 4.5 million versus September 2016, the digital
channels are currently used by around 1 million clients a day. Taking also into
consideration our retail postal network with around 1.5 million visitors per day, we can
count on around 2.5 million customers visit per day. I believe everybody is able to
appreciate this remarkable numbers.
Let's now move to BancoPosta regulatory framework on slide number 11. And as much as
BancoPosta capital adequacy is concerned, let me stress four major key points.
BancoPosta regulatory framework continues to be fully aligned with EU standards. Nine
months 2017 CET1 ratio reached 17.1%, almost doubling the normal regulatory
requirements. Nine months 2017 leverage ratio stands at 3%. Nine months proﬁtability
recorded a remarkable 28% return on equity. All these numbers coupled with a zero
lending risk proﬁle makes BancoPosta a unique superior returns (14:56) fee-based
revenues player in the Italian ﬁnancial industry.
Let's move to Insurance and Asset Management business in the following slide. As you
can appreciate, we are providing you for the ﬁrst time with the key metrics of our
Insurance and Asset Management business. Let's start from life fees, which increased
more than 18% in nine months 2017. This is due to the increase in gross written premium
and in technical reserves.
On private pension plans, total fees are up year-on-year by €8 million or 20%. Last year,
we also booked an extraordinary item for €55 million. We recognized a positive and
increasing contribution of P&C technical margin, thanks to the signiﬁcant growth in gross
written premium. Also Asset Management is showing an important 50% increase in fees,
due to the relative increase in assets. On cost side, you can appreciate the limited 2.1%
increase in the ﬁrst nine months 2017. These allows us to post a 28% or €120 million
increase in the divisional EBIT, reaching €556 million versus the €436 million of last year.
Let's move to slide number 13. Group gross written premium. In nine months 2017, group's
gross written premium increased by around €1 billion, for a total amount of €16.4 billion
(17:05), up 6.1% from the same period in 2016, driven primarily by the continued growth of
our life business, conﬁrming Poste Italiane Group as the number one life insurer in the
Italian market.

FINAL

As you can see in this slide, this growth has been recorded in all our products, Life, Private
Pension Plans and P&C products. At the same time, our customer base has grown
substantially in all these three business areas reaching 3.6 million customers in the Life
business, 0.9 million customers in private pension plan business and almost 1 million
customers in P&C business. In particular, we have beneﬁted from double-digit growth
even from the small base in our non-life premiums, whose results will become more and
more material going forward.
Regarding Solvency II, at the end of the nine months 2017, eligible owned funds were
equal to €8.5 billion, up €1 billion versus the €7.5 billion at nine months 2016. On the other
side, Solvency capital requirements increased by €1 billion to €3 billion. As a
consequence, the Solvency II ratio at the end of September 2017 is equal to 283% versus
the 380% registered at the end of September 2016.
Let's move to slide number 14. In the ﬁrst nine months, life premium net inﬂows were
equal to €7 billion. The signiﬁcant outﬂow in Class III is attributable to the €3.7 billion
maturities on guaranteed index linked products, with no impact on our P&L. The majority
of this amount has been reinvested by our customers in Class I guaranteed product.

Bloomberg Transcript

Furthermore, let me underline that at the end of September, our remarkable lapse rate
was equal to 2.82%, decreasing 6 basis points versus last year, a ﬁgure which is far lower
than the market benchmark of 4.6% registered at the end of 2016.
Let's move to slide number 15, technical reserves evolution. Group technical reserves
increased by €7 billion, up 6% from September 2016, beneﬁting from the continual
growth of insurance business. On the 7th of November, our realized capital gains reached
€9.3 billion growing from the €7.8 billion at the end of September 2017. This value will
allow us to continue oﬀering higher than market returns to policyholders and, therefore, a
continual growth in the insurance business strengthening our market leadership.
With regard to our investment portfolio breakdown, the increase of investments in multiasset funds, which moved from 13% at the end of September 2016 to 17% at the end of
September 2017, conﬁrm our diversiﬁcation strategy towards a more adequate risk return
proﬁle. At the same time, the average minimum guarantee in Class I policy has been
reduced from 1% to 0.9%.
Let's move to slide number 16 for some key ratios. Here we have the Asset Management
business. And as much as Asset Management operation, let me underline that assets
under management increased by close to 14% year-on-year, reaching €8 billion, with our
customer base increasing by 26% to more than 600,000 customers. As you can see, with
lower investment returns in the bond market, our customer risk return proﬁle has shifted
towards more balance/ﬂexible and equity products.
Let's move to slide number 17. In this slide are shown the results of the monetary program
that has been internally established relative to the cross-selling index. This index is a clear
measure of our ability to extract value from our customer base. This index will be a key
driver for the future strategic plan and for the future strategic growth of Poste Italiane. As
Page 5 of 15

FINAL

you can see, the index is showing a solid growth quarter-after-quarter. We will be focused
on keeping this growth going forward.
Let's move to slide number 18. Total revenues and operating proﬁt for Mail and Parcels
business. Intrasegment segment revenues decreased by approximately 2.4% or €83
million mainly due to the lower commissioning received from the Financial Services
business unit. This commissioning reduction is related to the previously described
revenues reduction accounted in this business unit.
Mail and Parcels, total market revenues instead posted a decrease of €58 million (24:10)
down 2.5%. The Parcels revenues increased by €41 million, up about 9%. This increase in
revenues was not able yet to compensate the overall 5.8% decline in Mail revenues. The
reduction of the operating proﬁt is completely related to the lower commissioning
accounted.

Bloomberg Transcript

Slide number 19, volume and market price for Mail and Parcels business. On volumes, let
me highlight here, in the ﬁrst nine months, Mail volumes reached 2.3 billion items down
approximately 8% versus the same period last year. The decline is mainly due to the esubstitution eﬀect and the drop in direct marketing volumes. As we know, the drop in
direct marketing volumes has a limited impact on our revenues.
As I commented previously, revenues decreased only 5.8% as a result of the tender
pricing discipline and the ongoing re-pricing eﬀect in recorded mail starting from January
2017. On the other hand, Parcels volumes increased by almost 19% year-on-year,
conﬁrming the excellent momentum mainly driven by the growing e-commerce
penetration in Italy. The Parcels price reduction is related to the strong increase of B2C ecommerce ﬂows characterized by lower price per unit.
Slide number 20, group operating cost. Overall, group operating costs fell by €162
million, down by minus 2.5% versus last year, as a consequence of our continued cost
management action and lower labor cost. With regard to cost management actions, we
have streamlined the group's organization and reducing the number of active companies.
This process is generating structural savings which are decreasing the group's cost base.
We expect the new strategic plan to focus on additional eﬃciencies and cost optimization.
Slide number 21. This is a focus on labor cost, as you can see. As you have seen in the
previous slide, total labor cost is down to €4.241 billion or minus 2.2% (sic) [2.1%] (27:26),
thanks to the reduction in the average number of employees. Let me remind you that at
the end of September, approximately 4,000 people have already signed our preretirement plan and that are not accounted yet in the average workforce that I mentioned
you. The result in terms of head count reduction for the ﬁrst nine months 2017 conﬁrm the
management commitment to reduce year-after-year the workforce. We are also in the
negotiation phase of the national labor contract. Details about this contract will be given
as soon as the agreement will be signed.
Let's move to slide number 22. Here, we have the evolution from the group EBIT to the
group net income. Net income for the period was equal to €724 million. On top of the
Page 6 of 15

FINAL

already commented EBIT evolution, the performance is related to net ﬁnancial losses
equal to €70 million, composed by positive net ﬁnancial income for €24 million and
Alitalia and Atlante write-oﬀ for almost €100 million. Taxes for a total consideration of
€383 million, corresponding to a tax rate of about 34.6%. As stated before, excluding the
above mentioned one-oﬀ eﬀect, net proﬁt would have been €839 million with a strong
increase plus 25% versus last year.
Let's move to slide number 23, capital expenditure. In the ﬁrst nine months of 2017, Group
CapEx was equal to €283 million, up €31 million or 12% from last year. The vast majority of
the investment program is mainly related to information technology and digital platforms.
The balance is related to select upgrade of facility data and logistics centers. This ﬁgures
show without any doubt that the recent management changes in Poste Italiane Group has
not reduced the commitment and the speed of our profound transformation program.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let's move on slide 24. Finally, let's focus on the industrial net ﬁnancial position. The
industrial net ﬁnancial position reached €417 million at the end of September 2017. The
negative change in working capital that you can see in the slide is due to the cash-out
related to the early retirement plan ﬁnalized in 2016 and the reduction in trade payables.
On the dividend and equity movement fronts, the €43 million outﬂow is the result of €466
million coming from our BancoPosta ring-fenced capital and dividends from participation
compensated by the payment of the dividend to our shareholders for an amount equal to
€509 million.
On top of our recurring CapEx, in the ﬁrst nine months 2017, we have recorded in our
M&A activities an inﬂow of €106 million related to the partial cash-in of MCC disposal and
the cash-out for €278 million for the SIA stake.
Thank you for your attention and let me hand over to the CEO, Matteo Del Fante for some
closing remarks.

Matteo Del Fante

{BIO 6237992 <GO>}

Thank you, Roberto. Just some ﬁnal remarks on our principal area of focus at the moment.
As you know, we recently announced and created in October a new business unit, a new
segment named Mobile Digital And Payments (sic) [Mobile and Digital Payments] (32:40).
The aim and the strategy behind this decision is to unify the oﬀer to retain the business
clients and public administration in the space, to increase our competitiveness in a faster
growing digital channel, creating an agile space to keep up the speed of the market and
to oﬀer high tech solution and convergence between physical and digital channels and
customer experience.
We believe that this new business unit will give a strong contribution going forward to the
growth of the group and to enhance shareholders' value. A second important step for us
is clearly the ongoing restructuring plan of the Mail and Parcels segment. The process is
on track. We are focusing on savings and eﬃciency and the quality of the service we oﬀer
to our customers.

Finally, as you know, we are ﬁnalizing our new strategic business plan which we aim to
present to the ﬁnancial markets in the ﬁrst month of 2018. We believe that all these eﬀorts
will lay the foundation to create an important long-term value proposition for our
shareholders.

FINAL

Thank you very much for your attention. And we can open up to Q&A. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. And we will take our ﬁrst question from Giovanni Razzoli of Equita. Please go
ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Giovanni Razzoli

{BIO 7269718 <GO>}

Yes. Hi, everybody. I want to ask a couple of questions from my side. First of all, I'd like to
ask whether it is a target of the plan to substitute credit (34:51) income of BancoPosta with
more recurring revenues? And my second question is about alternative day delivery, in
particular, how is the implementation strategy evolving? And last, can you provide us an
updated yield spread sensitivity for BancoPosta? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Matteo Del Fante

{BIO 6237992 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you, Giovanni. It's not yet a target to replace the capital gain with recurring
items, but we're clearly well aware of the fact that the multiple that the market is
recognizing to Poste is clearly – bank debt is clearly taking a hit because of this factor. The
second question is for the CFO.

A - Roberto Giacchi

{BIO 20101579 <GO>}

I'll make a comment on the overall restructuring Mail and Parcels business, part of which is
the alternative delivery model. For the Parcels business, we aim to take further advantage
of the growing e-commerce segment, which represents a great opportunity both for
domestic and cross-border ﬂows, in order to increase our market share.
In the Mail business, we want, on the other side, to conﬁrm our market share to the
constant improvement in quality, while at the same time, supporting business
sustainability to eﬃciency initiatives. With particular reference to the new delivery model
and the alternate delivery model, after completing the plan implementation for 2016, we
are now considering some adjustments, needed to maximize both speed and eﬃciency
and customer satisfaction. We expect to complete the full implementation of the new
delivery models in 2018 and about this at the moment the negotiation with unions is in
progress.
The eﬃciency objectives are also (37:43) by leveraging on other initiatives such as for
example, the reengineering, sorting and sequencing processes, and a lean manufacturing
approach. Thanks.

{BIO 6237992 <GO>}

And I think the third question was on the yield on our investment portfolio.

Q - Giovanni Razzoli

{BIO 7269718 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes.

A - Matteo Del Fante

{BIO 6237992 <GO>}

As you have seen on page 16, we experienced a marginal decrease in interest income that
was more than compensated by additional capital gains for 2017 versus 2016. And the
eﬀect is, basically, the ﬂip side of the increase, if you look at the last few months of the
unrealized gains we have in the portfolio. So we put on page 6 end of September 2017
€1.6 billion of unrealized gains. As of yesterday, this ﬁgure is slightly above €3 billion. So
when rates going down, we have a negative eﬀect on the interest income of the new
investments we do where we have a positive eﬀect on our investment portfolio.

Q - Giovanni Razzoli

{BIO 7269718 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

We will take our next question from Michael van Wegen of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Michael van Wegen

{BIO 6435238 <GO>}

Thank you. Good afternoon. Thank you. Good afternoon. A couple of questions. First of
all, on the one-oﬀs that you highlighted for the nine-month, can you specify how much
they are for each of them and can you also clarify which ones or how much of that is
related to Q3 speciﬁcally? That's question number one.
Question number two, looking at your new insurance disclosure and, particularly, the
management fees that you show for life insurance, they're up 30% year-over-year where
your technical provisions are up only 6%. So can you help me understand why that
management fee is growing considerably faster than technical provisions are growing?
And then, ﬁnally, your Solvency II ratio in Q3 dropped by about 10 points. Can you help us
understand what the moving parts were in the quarter and what the sensitivities of that
Solvency II ratio are going forward? Thank you very much.

A - Roberto Giacchi

{BIO 20101579 <GO>}

Okay. I'll take the ﬁrst one. And I do a summary of the one-oﬀ in cards in the nine months
of 2017 versus the same period last year. During this period, we have had – during the ﬁrst
nine months 2017, we have had the following one-oﬀ. Real estate fund distributed by
BancoPosta for €61 million, the low EBIT Alitalia write-oﬀ for €81 million. In the same

Page 9 of 15

FINAL

period of last year, we have had only one capital gain related to the disposal of Visa for
€121 million.
About your question on net technical reserves, I'm going back to the slide that we
showed you. So we are basically saying that our management fees are increasing by
29.8% in life business and 23.5% in private pension plans business. And this is related
both to the increase of the net technical reserves and to the pricing structure of the
products that we place in the network.

A - Matteo Del Fante

{BIO 6237992 <GO>}

And I think the sensitivity on the Solvency II, we can tell you that a 100% increase, if we
look simply at our exposure in the portfolio to (43:30) a 100% increase in yield has an
impact of 40 basis points in terms of unrealized – of Solvency. And the same increase of
the spread between Italian registry and bond of 100 basis points has an impact of 75 basis
points.

Q - Michael van Wegen

{BIO 6435238 <GO>}

To clarify, interest rates going up is a negative of 48 (44:12) percentage points or a
positive or negative?

A - Matteo Del Fante

{BIO 6237992 <GO>}

It is negative.

(44:19) yes. We show on page, unrealized gain on the portfolio – the investment portfolio,

ﬁgure revise (44:50) for the decrease in interest rate is now above today €9 billion.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Hi. Good afternoon. Just a couple of questions. One, can you give us the yield to majority
of the bond portfolio on the BancoPosta business? And secondly, you mentioned on the
previous question that you have changed some pricing structure on the insurance back
book. Can you give some more color on that, what pricing stuﬀ, what have you changed,
because it's a material increase in terms of proﬁts from management fees? And the last
one would be, you have done some asset derisking in the Insurance business again. So
how much more can you do? Is there any target you have? Thank you.

Q - Anna Adamo

{BIO 16893946 <GO>}

Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. You rightly mentioned that there
were a number of (47:10) one-oﬀs as recorded in the (47:12). And I'm wondering (47:17)
expect that the portfolio would be based on adjusted earnings (47:25) earnings. In other
words I would like to (47:27) dividend of 2017 (47:32) for the dividend of 2017?
And the second question on the...

A - Matteo Del Fante

{BIO 6237992 <GO>}

you can...

Q - Anna Adamo

{BIO 16893946 <GO>}

I just want to understand whether the dividend policy for 2017 will be based on adjusted
earnings rather than state of earnings.

A - Matteo Del Fante

{BIO 6237992 <GO>}

Okay.

Q - Anna Adamo

{BIO 16893946 <GO>}

Because obviously you mentioned there are a number of one-oﬀs (48:10) nine months
results.

A - Roberto Giacchi

{BIO 20101579 <GO>}

But Anna, we are really sorry, but the line is very bad, so we got just part of the question.
We understood that you are making a question about the dividend policy, and if this is the
right questions, we have already stated the dividend policy for this year. And we will
provide the dividend policy for the following years as soon as we will present at the
beginning of next year our industrial plan.

A - Matteo Del Fante

{BIO 6237992 <GO>}

Q - Anna Adamo

(48:59) whether this dividend policy is based on adjusted earnings.

A - Matteo Del Fante

{BIO 6237992 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes. I was about to say, yes, exactly, is on stated proﬁts, okay, is on accounting proﬁts.

Q - Anna Adamo

{BIO 16893946 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. And lastly, just on the restructuring expenses in the fourth quarter, can
you remind us about how much the restructuring expenses will be recorded in the total
business?

A - Matteo Del Fante

{BIO 6237992 <GO>}

That speciﬁc item relates to the amount of people that will exit the ﬁrm over the course of
the plan and there would be an accounting item in the last quarter. But given we are in
process of discussing on the one hand with the unions, on the other, obviously, on the
plan, unfortunately, Anna, we understood the question, but we're not in a position of
giving a precise answer at this point in time. Sorry.

Q - Anna Adamo

{BIO 16893946 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Emanuele Borghetti of Intermonte. Please go ahead. Your
line is open.

Q - Emanuele Borghetti

{BIO 19118661 <GO>}

Good evening, everybody. Just a couple of questions from my side. The ﬁrst one regards
the duration of the BancoPosta portfolio bonds. I mean I saw some changes in the – even
a slight changes in the duration of the bond portfolio. If you could provide us with, I don't
know, some kind of guidance or I mean kind of target you have in mind for the duration of
the bond portfolio.
And second question regards the insurance investments, if you could provide us with the
average reinvestment yield you are currently obtaining on the new ﬂows of investments
and an update on assets and liabilities directions on that side?
And ﬁnally, regarding the cost of labor, if in third quarter the cost of labor includes some
elements regarding the negotiation of the national labor agreement with the unions?
Thank you.

FINAL

Okay. Yes. I'll take your ﬁrst question in terms of portfolio duration. As we stated, we
decreased by 0.3 years the portfolio duration and that was on the back of some of the
capital gains that has been realized over the course of the last 12 months. And obviously,
the interest rate environment that does not suggest taking duration risk at this point in
time.

A - Matteo Del Fante

{BIO 6237992 <GO>}

Yes. I'll answer to your second and third question. I'll start from the third one on labor
contract. Clearly, the negotiation is undergoing. So we cannot yet provide speciﬁc
numbers. Anyhow, the value is in line with the usual market negotiation and the labor cost
that we posted in the ﬁrst nine months 2017 do include the accounting that we will have to
pay based on our estimation for the negotiation.
About insurance and technical reserves, given the current market expectation and in line
with investment strategy deﬁned in the medium term by the board of directors, our
investment decisions will continue to be focused on conservative targets with our
technical reserves mainly invested in govies and corporate bonds. Anyhow, keeping a
moderate risk appetite, our investment diversiﬁcation process will continue in the coming
years should increase in multi-assets and alternative investments.

Q - Emanuele Borghetti

{BIO 19118661 <GO>}

on the strategy regarding this side of the business? Thank you.

{BIO 6237992 <GO>}
