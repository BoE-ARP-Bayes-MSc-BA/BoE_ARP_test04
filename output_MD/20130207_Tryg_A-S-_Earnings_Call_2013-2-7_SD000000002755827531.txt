{BIO 18028603 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone. Welcome to this presentation of Tryg's 2012 results. Today with
me I have my CEO Morten Hubbe and we have our CFO Tor Loennum. So please, Morten.

Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Thank you, Lars. Welcome to all of you both here in Copenhagen and live on the webcast.
I guess that, traditionally, the Fourth Quarter is, earning-wise, the low point of the year. But
I guess, with a combined ratio of 87.4% in the Fourth Quarter 2012, we've seen a quite
strong development, some 7percentage points better than the quarter the year before,
helped, to a large extent, by a strong development in our Private Lines business, also in
our Swedish business. And I guess the year-on-year comparison helped by the fact that
the combined ratio in Corporate in Fourth Quarter the year before was quite high at 98%.
We also see a significant improvement in our cost ratio in the Fourth Quarter, starting to
be impacted by the general efficiency program that we have launched. All in all, more than
a doubling of our technical result for the quarter to some DKK648m, clearly helped by the
fact that we've seen very few winter claims in the Fourth Quarter and we've seen no
windstorms.
If you look at the investment income on the other hand, that is for the Fourth Quarter
lower than for the previous quarter in 2011. We chose to write down the value of our
headquarters in Ballerup by some DKK200 million in the Fourth Quarter. Some of you

FINAL

remember also a write-down of DKK150 million in the Second Quarter, which was related
to a new rental contract with Nordea Life and Pensions. The write-down in the Fourth
Quarter was due to the fact that we're currently doing our efficiency program of DKK1
billion where we need more ability and more flexibility to adjust, also, our premises. The
previous value was based on a rather long lease contract and that to achieve more
flexibility we've chosen to write down the value by at least DKK200m.
If we look at the full year 2012, we've seen a strong improvement by some six -- some
DKK920 million in the technical results, or roughly 60% for the full year, largely driven by
the improvement of some 5percentage points to the combined ratio, which actually
means that 2012 had the strongest combined ratio in a five-year period. And when you
add to that an investment income which, including the write-down of premises, was more
than DKK500 million higher than the year before, we saw, in total, a pretax result that
increased from DKK1.6 billion to a bit more than DKK3b.

Bloomberg Transcript

When we look at the full year, there's no doubt that all four business segments
contributed significantly. I'm very pleased to see that, by now, after many years of losses,
our Swedish business has a profit of more than DKK100 million in the full year. But I think
it's very important to bear in mind that, while we've seen strong improvement in this
result, we also had a lot of tailwind helping the result. For instance, we had some 10,000
fewer weather claims in 2012 which, in isolation, carried a helping hand of some
DKK370m, year on year.
We also had a positive development in our run-off and we had positive development in
reinsurance. Then, I guess, if we could ask for roughly the same investment result in 2013,
that would be great but I guess we shouldn't really expect that. We've had significant
gains on equities and, of course, with the dropping interest rates, we've had capital gains
on bonds in 2012 that will not be repeated again in 2013.
On the other hand, 2012 was the first year where we saw our efficiency program, which is
to give us DKK1 billion of efficiency gains by 2015 annually, have its first important step in
2012 with an impact of some DKK175 million while, in 2013, we have a plan to achieve an
additional DKK375 million from this program.
And I guess, all in all, this has allowed us to suggest a rather generous dividend in line with
the new dividend policy where we will suggest to the General Assembly to pay out DKK26
per share or some DKK1.6 billion in total, expecting that to be stable and grow nominally
in the years to come. And as Tor will get back to, also restructuring of our sub debt,
following which we will make an extraordinary share buyback of DKK800 million in 2013.
And as you can see, an ROE of 22% after tax, which is actually higher than our target but
also helped by this tailwind from investments and from the weather claims.
Clearly, 2012 has been a year with lots of activities; we've shown some of them here. Very
important that we've displayed our new financial target; 90 and below on combined ratio,
15 and below on the cost ratio, 20% post tax on the ROE.

I think, clearly, the savings program of DKK1 billion is what will drive the improvements in
the coming years and really we've only just started that in 2012.

FINAL

A new agreement with Nordea that is expected to increase our earnings. And also, I think,
a good solution to our business in Finland that didn't turn a profit. And very importantly, a
more solid and more predictable yield and dividend policy for the coming period.
The new business areas to create these odd, strangely looking cars on track[ph]. This is
supposed to show how are we supposed to improve the operations further in the coming
years, and there is a large number of areas that we need to improve further. We have, in
2012, stepped up significantly our efforts to improve our work on price differentiation, on
utilizing the maximum value of the data we already have to strike the exact right amount
of risk and price, to attract the right customers and to become more profitable in that
sense.
Clearly, we feel strong improvement in our Commercials business in 2012; result had
improved by DKK300m. Thus to improve Commercial further is extremely important as
our costs, our distribution and our processes still need significant improvement.
Our Swedish business has progressed well in 2012 but, clearly, that needs to be built upon
much further also in 2013.

Bloomberg Transcript

Then, finally, our savings program of DKK1 billion is where we put a lot of our effort and
resources in the current period and in the coming years.
Cleaning up products and systems sounds very unsexy but really there is a huge amount
of value and avoided costs potential in cleaning up all old products and thereby making
the systems cheaper and more flexible.
And I guess, and Tor will elaborate on this, but it's important to see in 2012 a significant
improvement in all four business areas. Clearly noteworthy is Sweden, which has
produced losses in a number of years and produces a positive income of DKK100 million
in 2012. You may notice that the Fourth Quarter looks rather odd and the full year looks
more straightforward. I guess the story is in 2011 we were reserving the expected claims
and towards the end of the year we got negative surprised on run of losses within the
current accounting year. Whereas, in 2012, due to the improvement in risk segmentation
and the higher pricing, towards the end of the year we saw that we had clearly been too
conservative in reserving for claims in Sweden.
So don't pay too much notice to this number, which is clearly impacted by the year-end
adjustments. But the 95% combined ratio in Sweden is more in line with where we are
currently as a run rate for the Swedish business, but that is also a significant improvement.
Clearly, Commercial, on the face of it, has very strong improvements to the combined
ratio and an improvement of DKK300 million in that business is extremely important. But it
is important to emphasize that we still have a number of structural issues that we need to
Page 3 of 19



Company N ame: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2013-02-07

improve in Commercial. For instance, Commercial still has a cost ratio of more than 20%;
our Private Lines business is approaching 15%. We need to make significant further
improvements to the cost ratio in Commercial.

FINAL

Secondly, we have a drop of some 2percentage points to the top line in Commercial, and
there are a number of processes that needs to be more efficient, both in distribution, in
administration, and we further need to improve on our risk segmentation and pricing.
So really the strongest improvement is in Private Lines. You see an improvement of some
5percentage points on the combined ratio, which actually means that we're making more
than DKK1.2 billion in Private Lines, an improvement of DKK0.5b, year on year. And in the
same time, the cost ratio in Private has been reduced from 16.4% to 15.7% in the year. And
furthermore, we have a positive development on the top line.
Corporate is moving in the right direction but, clearly, we still see the pricing in the
corporate market being challenging. But in our portfolio it's moving in the right direction
and the January 1 renewal this year has actually been better than the year before.

Bloomberg Transcript

I won't dwell much into these numbers but, clearly, when we look at the technical results
there's not much doubt that the fact that we have four solid legs to stand on is much
more sound and one of the reasons why the results have improved together, of course,
with the tailwind, as we discussed, from weather claims, etc.
But if we look across the board, the Swedish result has improved by DKK100m, the
Corporate result by DKK150m, the Commercial result by DKK300 million and the Private
Lines result by almost DKK500m. And clearly, that is a much stronger platform than in
previous years where mainly Private Lines was driving the results.
Tor has explained many times during 2012 how the savings program is the biggest driver
of improvements in the coming years and, clearly, you see the expected reduction of
DKK1 billion in annual savings by 2015. We have reported here the achieved savings in
expenses and claims in 2012, all in all, some DKK175m. And if you look at the target for
2013 and for 2013 on claims we see, all in all, that we need to step that up by a further
DKK375 million in 2013 to continue to improve operations even in a year where we
probably should expect less tailwind than in 2012.
And I guess, finally, before I hand the word to Tor, clearly an important announcement in
December on the new dividend policy. You remember we debated that actually
historically the payouts have been fairly handsome but extremely unstable. We announced
in December the new dividend policy to pay out between 60% and 90% of current year's
earnings, with an aim to have nominal, stable and growing dividends. And in the light of
that, we have suggested to the General Assembly this DKK26 per share or some DKK1.6
billion in total dividend payout, expected that to grow nominally stable in the coming
years. And the adjustment further of buybacks to handle the capital adjustment expected
to buy back some DKK800 million worth in 2013.
Then I will hand it over to you, Tor. Quite a good picture of you on this slide.

FINAL

Thanks, Morten. I guess, when you look at the numbers in terms of the premium growth,
clearly it's a low premium growth and even a negative growth in Q4. And of course, that is
an issue for us but we have clearly stated that we prioritize the profitability side over the
premiums side.
I guess what's important is really that you can still see here in terms of the average
premium level that we continue to grow in terms of average premium. In particular,
following the Norwegian portfolio, you can see that there is an above 4% growth year-onyear on Norwegian motor -- sorry, on Norwegian house, which I think is necessary. It's a
more flattish development in terms of the Danish prices.
If you look at the retention rate, clearly you can see that both in Denmark and Norway on
the private line. It's leveling out so it looks fairly stable. That means that when you look at
what is going on in terms of the portfolio clearly it's the number of new policies that
becomes an issue when you look at the premium development.

Bloomberg Transcript

Looking at the commercial segment, you can see that it's leveling out here in terms of the
Danish book, which is good and it looks good for the renewals as well. We still have an
issue with the Norwegian book and clearly that's a part of the business where we need to
improve our efforts.
If we look at the Swedish book, I think Morten has commented a lot related to the
development here. But I guess in our mind it's important to say that even though you had
a drop in terms of retention levels, clearly that is correlated to the improvement that we
have here in terms of the profitability which I think is really good. It's also a very healthy
growth there in terms of premium levels. So I guess it underpins the focus on the
profitability side.
If we talk a bit more about the level of claims, clearly 2012 has been a good insurance
year. It's been a good insurance year as Morten mentioned in terms of the level of claims.
I will get back to it, but if you look at the level of large claims, it's a small drop but a
significant drop if you compare to the 2011 figures. It's related to the weather. But all in all,
if you look at the broad picture of the business, 2012 has been a very good insurance
year.
If you look at the level of large claims you can see here that this is on a gross basis. There
is a drop on a gross basis. If you look at it on a net basis it's still a drop of 0.4percentage
points in terms of impact of large claims.
If you look at the weather claims you can see here that we have a drop in the level of
DKK370 million on a net basis, which is roughly slightly less than 2percentage points.
Then if you look of the run-off net here, it's a small increase, about 0.4percentage points.
So overall you can say that in terms of level of improvement, slightly less than

Page 5 of 19



Company N ame: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2013-02-07

3percentage points comes here from the level of large claims, weather claims and runoff.

FINAL

If you look at the investment book, I guess Q4 has been a relatively good quarter, both in
terms of returns on equities, in terms of returns on bonds, both on local bonds, but also
on high yield bonds. The high-yield index for instance in Q4 was slightly higher than 3%, so
quite a good quarter.
So you can look here that totally a pretty strong investment result but clearly impacted by
the write-down of the domicile property. I guess it's important just to underpin what
Morten said initially, what we have done is increased our flexibility and we have roughly
half the length of the lease period on the property on the domicile. But it's still a relatively,
what should we say, it's a number of years still in terms of the lease agreement but it has
been reduced and thus increasing our flexibility.
In terms of the assets allocation there is no significant changes.

Bloomberg Transcript

Talking a bit more about the subordinated debt. I guess what the really important part
here is when you look at what is going on what we are planning to do and we are going to
market in the next few days is a new subordinated loan of DKK800 million which will be
perpetual and with a non-call of 10 years.
Clearly that means that in principle we are substituting equity for subordinated debt which
has the same quality on the individual solvency. So we are maintaining the level of
solvency with the new subordinated debt. That is a shift because the old loan here of
DKK500 million from Tryghedsgruppen has not been perpetual and as such that means
that it could not count as capital on the individual solvency regulation.
Yes, I guess that concludes my part. Morten.

Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Just one slide to summarize. Clearly we are pleased with the combined ratio of 88.2% for
the full year. And clearly we are pleased by an increase of 60% in the technical result. I
guess a pre-tax result of DKK3 billion is also more than we had expected.
It is important to distinguish between the expected underlying improvements, the
strengthening or the beginning of the efficiency program helping by DKK175 million and
then the helping tailwind we've seen from weather claims from run-off and from large
claims and particularly from investments.
It clearly shows we have taken yet another step in the right direction. If we look at the
coming years and 2013, we've shown again our target to be consistently at or below 90%,
below 15% on cost ratio and above 20% post tax ROE.

FINAL

And clearly if we only had years with a tailwind we could lean back and relax. But I guess
we should all expect also to have future years with a headwind instead and that is why this
step up of our savings program where we need to achieve an additional DKK375 million in
2013 and then further improvement in 2014 and 2015 will be extremely important.
It's extremely important that we, through that, continuously lower our claims cost, lower
our cost ratio and further improve our efficiency on that mark to allow us to deliver 20%
ROE despite the very low interest rates, and also deliver improvements to the technical
result in a year where we should expect less tailwind than we saw in 2012.
So clearly a step in the right direction and a lot of further improvements needed to handle
the more difficult years as well.
I guess, Lars, that opens the floor for questions.

Questions And Answers
A - Lars Moeller

{BIO 18028603 <GO>}

Yes, now we are ready to take questions. I think we will start with inside and then
afterwards we will change to the conference call. So Per, please.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you. Two questions in the first round. The first if you look at the country figures,
Norway comes up with combined ratio close to 98. Prior year gains are still positive. Can
you give some explanation?
The second one, DKK800 million buy back, where does that figure come from? It is
DKK500 million 1.5[ph] any thoughts why? I guess the figure is just not plopping down
from the sky.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I guess to the first question, Per, it's important to say that the contract figures will always
be impacted by the level of large claims. So you can say that there has been large claims
in the Norwegian business in Q4 and that's, I guess, the most important single explanation
to the difference between Norway and Denmark.
To the other question in terms of where the figure DKK800 million comes from, you can
say that the calculation related to the individual solvency is based on the old Solvency 1
Regulation. So it's the basis on the maximum level of subordinated debt that can be
utilized under the current regulation. Then it's rounded down. It's not the exact figure of
DKK800m, it's slightly above but it's the maximum level.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

I guess it doesn't take into account the exit from the Finnish business?
Page 7 of 19



Company N ame: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

FINAL

Well you can say that it doesn't really have anything to do with the Finnish business at all.
Because the most important part is when you look at the total equity, how can we utilize
the capital in the best possible way. That's one issue. That relates to the Finnish business
as you say.
But then if you look at the subordinated debt isolated, it's important to say that it's the
Solvency 1 regulation that sets the standard on how much subordinated debt you counted
into your capital.

A - Tor Loennum
I guess, Per, if what you're really asking is have we maximized the potential payout and
buyback. I guess the answer is, no, we haven't maximized that. But if we look back at what
we said in the dividend policy, the aim was to achieve something that was high, attractive
but that would also be sustainable and we would be able to aim for a nominally increasing
dividend.

Bloomberg Transcript

And from time to time adjustments to the capital base. Because I think we've seen also
historically rather high peaks of payout. We're really having high peaks in one year and
then significant reductions in the following year it doesn't create any sustainability or
stability from a shareholder point of view.
So we have tried to achieve a high payout, high dividend or higher share buyback, but at
the same time, a platform that will allow us to grow that and provide stability in the years
to come. So that is very deliberate on our side.

A - Lars Moeller

{BIO 18028603 <GO>}

Additional questions, Jen[ph]?

Q - Unidentified Participant
Yes. A couple of questions from me as well. Just to go back to Denmark Norway, what Per
just asked. If I understand correctly the large claims in Norway were around DKK140 million
or something which is 700 bps on the combined. So not discussing run-off, but then from
90.5% we end up at 91%. Denmark, so it would be just interesting to have a bit more of a
flavor on the Q4 performance in Norway and at the same time also in Denmark because
in Denmark you are at 77.7% which is extraordinarily the other way. I guess there's a lot of
run-off in Danish business, but has everything gone in your direction in the last quarter in
Denmark or what? That's the first question.
Secondly, more in general, it's quite interesting because I continue to read and look in
newspapers and it's all over, customers disgruntled with insurance companies, price hikes,
people can't take it anymore. First of all I thought the price hikes more or less, generally at
least were ended quite a few months ago. So I don't know if people are realizing later or
what the heck is going on.

Page 8 of 19



Company N ame: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity

But I don't see in your retention figures, there's no sign of all these customers leaving you.
I'm not sure how to square this few kinds of information.

FINAL

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well if I take the second question first, Jen. I think you are right in that observation. I think
there's probably a trend currently that the financial sector is in the easy area to beat up on
in the press. I think particularly that goes for banks. But to some extent insurance
companies as well.
I think the way we look at it when we have a target of 90% combined ratio or below that is
equivalent to saying that every time we have a top line of 100 we want to keep 10. When
we set that target if you look back to 2010 we kept 1. No one would accept that.
And clearly when you look at what we're currently doing is we have adjusted the pricing to
higher levels of thefts, break-ins, higher levels of weather claims. There are 35% more
break-ins, stealing more valuable stuff which means our expenses have increased now by
more than 50%. Weather claims have increased by more than 80%. Of course we've had
to adjust prices to that.

Bloomberg Transcript

But when we look at what is going on currently, the main drivers to improve our result is
the efficiency measures and not pricing. That is why we're going through this program of
DKK1b. And you are exactly right but if you look at our retention numbers they are, if
anything, improving slightly.
So we don't recognize either that there should be a huge number of customers
wandering off. I think the area where we have said goodbye to customers mainly is in
corporate lines. There we have been very clear that we wanted pricing in corporate lines
to increase and clearly when you do that you should accept to lose a few customers.
But we are seeing improvement in the retention of private clients and commercial lines,
which I think is important and I think really it shows the difference between what you read
in the newspapers and what is actually going on.
And I guess finally, not to make it too long, what also happened in 2012 was that Tryg in
Norway was rewarded the best company to produce high quality claims handling by
customers of the larger companies. In Denmark in 2012 Tryg was again rewarded, the
large company with the highest customer satisfaction overall. And clearly those factors are
important for us to continue to nurture and keep alive and further improve. Because of
course they are important for the customers, their loyalty and ultimately our earnings as
well.

A - Tor Loennum
Yes, I think to the first question it's important to say again that when you look at the level
of claims in Denmark it has been a very benign quarter. We've seen a drop in terms of the
level of claims related to the motor business, we've seen a drop in the level of claims
related to the housing content business, so, yes, it has been a very benign quarter.
Page 9 of 19



Company N ame: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2013-02-07

On the other hand, you can say that the Norwegian book or business is also the book
where you will typically see a higher number of claims in Q4 because you have higher
impact of winter-related claims. So to me at least it does make sense that you do see a
slightly higher combined in Q4.

FINAL

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I guess we've seen on house and on commercial property, we've really seen for four or
five years that the claims ratio was too high in Denmark and not in Norway. That number is
starting to reduce considerably in the Fourth Quarter. And we did need it.

A - Lars Moeller

{BIO 18028603 <GO>}

More questions from inside here? Per.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Let me take a couple more. If I look at slide, let's see where are we, on slide 12. You have
the average price on house insurance. My question is that you have made quite significant
price increases last couple of years in Denmark. The price though is flat. Have those prices
not come through, what is the reason behind that?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

(technical difficulty). I think where it says house it should say car. And where it says car it
should say house. Sorry about that confusion. Typo.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Then another question. You addressed on Sweden that you had significant negative oneoff in the Fourth Quarter last year and positive adjustment this year. I guess that's interest
(multiple speakers) it is effectively the run-off results.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

That is completely right. If you look at the run-off line, you cannot find it because it's
actually adjustments to previous quarters of the given year. Correct.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Then turning to Norway, 80% the last two quarters, now close to 100%, maybe 91% to the
large claims. Any of the same sort of adjustment in Norway?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

No not really. So as I say, one important factor is related to the large claims again. Then I
would say normal seasonal pattern.
Then I guess it's important also to say that we are talking about quarterly numbers here.
So it is after all volatility between the quarters which is not sort of -- can't be pinned down
to exactly this or that.

FINAL

I think that you can clearly see that in Denmark you either have winter or you don't. In
Norway if you do the analysis five or 10 years back you see more consistent difference
between the winter quarters and the summer quarters. And when we think we've had a
rather green winter, there's been snow throughout the entire winter in Norway and quite
cold. So you should really expect that in the future as well.

A - Lars Moeller

{BIO 18028603 <GO>}

We would like to switch to external list now. So operator please.

Operator
Thank you. Your first question comes from Hans Pluijgers from Cheuvreux. Please go
ahead.

Q - Hans Pluijgers

{BIO 16245530 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning, gentlemen.

A - Lars Moeller

{BIO 18028603 <GO>}

Operator, do we have any questions?

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Hans Pluijgers

{BIO 16245530 <GO>}

Yes, can you hear me?

Operator
Please go ahead. Your first question comes from Hans Pluijgers from Cheuvreux. Please
go ahead.

Q - Hans Pluijgers

{BIO 16245530 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. It's Hans Pluijgers. Two questions from my side. First of all, coming
back on Norway, and of course now looking at the graphs on page 12 a little bit different,
but still. For the housing segment you indicated a 2.5% increase in average premiums. But
if I understand also that the underlying inflation in Norway is higher, so if the real, let's say,
excluding of course the impacts you take to reduce claims, the underlying cost inflation is
the 2.5% in line with that, or could you a little bit talk about what's happening there.
And secondly on the renewals on the corporate side, you say that the renewals were
quite well with respect to pricing as I understand, but how did volumes develop there?
You already gave some indication that you were getting rid of some clients, or were not -unhappy that some clients would leave. So could you give some feeling what the volumes
did in the renewal season in beginning of this year?

FINAL

I think if I take the second question first, you're right that the renewal season for
corporate January 1 is important, because it's roughly 70% of our corporate book that
renews January 1. And correct we saw again this year the second year in a row increasing
prices in our corporate book.
And when it comes to volume as you ask we see that the renewal January 1, '13 was
stronger than the renewal January 1, '12. And I think really the worse renewal was January
1, '11 so we are sort of continuing a positive trend in the market that is the most
challenging from a pricing point of view.

Q - Hans Pluijgers

{BIO 16245530 <GO>}

But do you mean that you didn't lose any volume in --?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I think if we didn't lose any customers January 1 that would be the first time in history. We
would usually -- the usual turnover is somewhere between 10% and 15% in a given year,
and then we would add new customers to close that gap. That is the usual annual
movement. And I guess renewal season January 1 was actually slightly more positive than
we expected, so less customers leaving than we saw in the two previous years.

But net/net effect was still negative (technical difficulty) I assume.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

But only very marginally.

Q - Hans Pluijgers

{BIO 16245530 <GO>}

Okay, clear.

A - Tor Loennum
I think in terms of the question related to the house insurance product in Norway and the
average premium clearly that's an area where we are following, monitoring the situation
very, very closely. We have talked about the fact that the risks are very high level of, let's
call it, pressure in the Norwegian economy. And clearly that's an issue and that's why I say
we need to monitor the situation and look at the development in terms of the premium
level. And clearly that means that there is price increases again January 1 this year. But at
least so far the development in terms of the premium level has been sufficient to take
into consideration the underlying inflation.

Q - Hans Pluijgers

{BIO 16245530 <GO>}

Maybe a last follow up question. Looking at the run-off gains again this year very good.
You always give an indication, but could you give again some guidance on what you

expect going forwards? Do you expect a tremendous level or do you expect some
leveling off in the coming years?

A - Tor Loennum

FINAL

Do you want me to answer?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Tor Loennum
I guess it's important to say that when you look at 2012 as you say, Hans, it has been a
good year in terms of run-off gains. Clearly we have stated that the long-term sustainable
level should be in the area of 2.5% to 3percentage points. When you look at the
development over the recent years at least it has been higher. And I guess what we have
said at least for the last six/nine months is that we do expect a slightly higher level of runoff gains in the next few quarters. But the long term sustainable level should be at around
3%.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

And I guess we can add, Tor, that if we look at our total claims to sales on the balance
sheet it's our impression that the strength of that has not been weakened during 2012.

Q - Hans Pluijgers

{BIO 16245530 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Simon Christensen from Nordea
Bank. Please go ahead.

Q - Simon Christensen

{BIO 16977812 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. Two questions. The first one is related to the sub debt issue that you
are conducting now. What is your ambition relative to the rate you paid on the Moderna
loan.
And secondly could you share with us what is the rise or fall in your average claim on
motor in Denmark in 2012 against '11. Thank you.

A - Tor Loennum
In terms of the ambition related to the subordinated debt clearly it's -- the ambition is that
we will -- should be able to improve the current rate with the loan that we have from -related to the Moderna acquisition.

But I don't want to be specific in terms of how many bps we are going to save, because
we are as I said we are starting to marketing the loan in these days. So we'll have to wait
and see.

FINAL

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I guess on the motor side we can say that we've seen a positive development on motor
both in terms of frequency and in terms of averages in Denmark, and then a higher
inflation in Norway. Clearly the frequency of motor claims has been reduced and most
notably in the Q4.
We also see that there is this outer[ph] tax system that allows us to compare our average
cost on motor claims in Denmark precisely to our peers. And we see that the advantage
we have to our peers on average motor repair costs has been expanded during 2012.
In addition, we've run a rather large program to improve our claims handlers' ability to
send our customers to our preferred garages, and that amount has been increased also
during 2012. So clearly motor is in a positive development from a claims point of view.
Then of course from a premium point of view impacted by the extent to which more and
more small cars are being bought in the Danish market, typically with a lower premium.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Simon Christensen

{BIO 16977812 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. And just a follow up how do you see the movement from (inaudible) in
terms of premium cuts. Do you see any increased risk of competition from the smaller
players?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well it's hard to say. I guess if you look at our motor premium in Denmark in reality they
have been reduced the previous years if you allow for inflation.
I have a hard time seeing that there is a general trend towards lower prices, but I don't -I'm not surprised that in some areas prices are slightly lower on motor, they are slightly
lower on our portfolio as well.
Whether there is an increased trend towards price competition, I don't see that but clearly
the smaller players are more volatile in changing their prices than the big players. I don't
think that's a new issue. I think it's been like that forever.

Q - Simon Christensen

{BIO 16977812 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Tor Loennum
I think it's important in terms of the competitive landscape to say that what we can say,
what we can do is to work on our internal efficiency, to work on our products, to work on
Page 14 of 19

Date: 2013-02-07

the internal improvements. And that's what we strive to do every day, and I guess that's
the most important part of being able to compete both here in Denmark and the other
countries.

FINAL

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

And I guess if you look at, Simon, most of the small players are competing with our private
lines business. And if you look at our private lines business for a second that is where in
2012 we've reduced the cost ratio from 16.4% to 15.7% which brings us to be one of the
most efficient private lines players in the Danish market.
And we expect to improve that further in the coming three years while at the same time
our savings on the claims procurement program will allow us to have significant savings on
the claims purchasing that these small competitors to do not have.
So clearly I think we are moving our efficiency in both cost and claims in a direction that will
allow us both to be competitive and have strong returns at the same time.

Q - Simon Christensen

{BIO 16977812 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks.

Thank you. Your next question comes from Jakob Brink from ABG. Please go ahead.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

Hi, it's Jakob here just a few questions on the capital. I know Per already asked about it,
but just, Morten, you said that you had not yet maximized what you could do. How do you
think about this in concern with your return on equity target in 2014 of 20%? Wouldn't it be
good to get the beginning of the year equity further down? Is that something you will
maybe be doing later on or should we think that this is it?
I mean, like Per also mentioned you have sold the Finnish operation which should give you
some capital relief. Also you do not pay out 100% of the profits, i.e. if you include the
DKK800 million extra subordinated debt you're basically saving up capital. Why is that,
especially now when you need to get to 20%? I don't know if you could give a bit more
flavor on that it would be helpful.

A - Tor Loennum
I guess I can start and you can supplement, Morten. I think it's important to say again,
Jakob, when you look at the new dividend policy and what we stated in December clearly
it will be slightly less transparent in terms of the capital side granted the fact that we want
to aim for a more stable and growing dividend. And as such it means -- it does mean that
you should allow for slightly more flexibility in terms of the capital base.

FINAL

On the other hand, clearly the ambition of delivering a 20% ROE should be -- should
install discipline with management in terms of making sure that we don't become very
highly over-capitalized so to speak.
So I guess we are trying to find a balance here between making sure that we can deliver a
stable and growing dividend going forward, making sure that we can deliver on the
targets in terms of the return on equity on the combined ratio and trying to adapt the
capital base to that situation.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

I don't know if it's realistic, but could it be that -- I guess another problem for you is that
nowadays your cash flow is so strong that when you actually do pay out the dividend then
start to actually do the share buybacks you are already heavily over-capitalized again.
Couldn't it be an idea to maybe do like Denmark and buy back for current year instead of
having to wait for one year? I mean that would also improve the profitability of course.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well it sounds -- I think you are right that in isolation both a higher buyback or using current
year's earnings, etc. would lower the equity and thereby help the ROE. But actually I think
we've put ourselves in a position as Tor says where we need to strike very high discipline
in many areas, because we want to create savings of DKK1 billion that requires discipline.
We want to be below 90% on the combined ratio. That requires discipline. We want to be
above 20% ROE in a period where interest rates are rather low.
And I think we want to strike the right balance between those, while as Tor said at the
same time allowing a stable and normally growing dividend. And that will require that we
work very hard on all parameters. And I think we will strike that balance as best we can.
And I think that follows well the dividend policy that we announced in December. And of
course we always listen to good ideas, but we haven't made a dividend policy in
December expecting to change it in February.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

No, no, that's not what I meant I was more meaning of the buyback I guess you could
have done more of that. Okay, that's fine thank you.

Do we have any additional questions inside here?

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

FINAL

Sorry just a couple of quick ones, maybe I should have read it somewhere but I didn't. The
buyback that you start, it starts after the AGM I guess right? And it's the idea that the
DKK800 million is going to be completed the calendar year '13 or Q1 '14 as well.

A - Tor Loennum
It starts before the AGM because we have an empowerment from the AGM already and - yes.

Q - Unidentified Participant
The idea is that we model it in.

A - Tor Loennum
Yes.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

The second question is something that I've asked before, but now you start with a
dividend, dividend per share is DKK0.26. So it's relatively high compared to expectations
let's put it like this. Then you set yourself an ambitious target that you want to grow this
DKK26.
And when I look at your asset mix I know it's not a lot but you still have high percent of
equities. We live in a volatile world. If I make terrific -- if I make very negative assumption
on equity markets well this would surely threat once again the idea of growing the
dividend going forward. So not why sell it off or reduce it, I mean really minimize the asset
risk of the company. What does prevent you to do that let me put it like this.

A - Tor Loennum
You want to leave that to me? Well I guess, yes, you can -- of course you can argue is the
asset mix still -- or the risk exposure still too high. I guess we are trying again to strike the
balance between various considerations, and after all the equity ratio that we have or the
equity percentage that we hold in our balance sheet is relatively low. So I guess after all
we do think that, let's call it, the exposure risk is acceptable. And that's all I'll comment to
that.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I guess I can complement only by saying that the ambition to have a stable and normally
growing dividend will mean that in most areas we will be more cautious and slightly
reduce our risks.

Page 17 of 19



Company N ame: Tryg A/S

And it also means that we've done a tremendous amount of work testing various
potential shocks to the capital base, for instance, drops in equity pricing. But only amongst
many other scenarios to test what shocks could impact us and how would that impact
dividends.

FINAL

And that's one of the reasons why were rather long with the dividend policy in 2012 to
test the various scenarios to be aware of what could threaten potentially the dividend.

A - Tor Loennum
But you are quite right, Gianandrea, clearly that's the highest risk in terms of the earnings,
so yes.

Q - Unidentified Participant
A question related to the same topic what is most important, getting a flat to rising
nominal dividend or not going above the 90% payout ratio in a year where we might see
equities drop 10%, 20%.

A - Tor Loennum
Yes, I think the range of the dividend policy is at least thought to be the threshold, so I
guess that will over[ph] on the nominal dividend if it comes to that.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well I guess it's -- you actually asked the question that we hadn't prepared any answers
for. I guess you should see that the purpose of the dividend policy is to be predictable
and stable. And the exact reason why we don't maximize the payout in one given year
and the reason why we test various shocks is to be well managed or prepared to manage
shocks in a good way and still be stable and growing.
Can you create scenarios where we cannot be stable and growing? Of course you can I
think we are all know that. But we are well prepared to make that as seldom as possible.

A - Tor Loennum
But I guess going back to the initial comment as Morten said when we have discussed the
dividend policy clearly the fact that you would see a significant impact of some sort in the
financial markets this -- that is what one would call a shock or a event that we should be
easily explainable in terms of the development in the dividend, there is something for you
to read out of the papers so to speak.

A - Lars Moeller

{BIO 18028603 <GO>}

Yes? Further questions from inside here? Operator, a last chance if you have external with
some questions.
