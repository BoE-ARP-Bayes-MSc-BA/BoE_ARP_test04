MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day and welcome to the Munich Re Half Year Financial Report to 2018 Conference
Call. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Christian Becker-Hussong.
Please go ahead.

Christian Becker-Hussong

{BIO 19080254 <GO>}

Thank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen to our Q2 earnings call. I have the
pleasure to welcome Joachim Wenning, CEO of Munich Re Group; and our CFO, Jörg
Schneider, this afternoon. Joachim will kick it off with his statement. As Jörg already
commented on our results in his audiocast this morning, we will then go right into Q&A.
So Joachim, please go ahead.

{BIO 16273429 <GO>}

Thank you, Christian, and welcome also to all of you out there on the phones. In the name
of Jörg and myself, welcome to this call. You all have already listened I guess to the
podcast that Jörg has produced, including the slides highlighting the key drivers of the
first half year results and business development. Before, I'd like to offer you my executive
summary, before we enter after that into the Q&A, I'd like to offer you three comments
on relatively recent news.
So let's start with news number one. News number one is that Jörg is having his 60th
birthday next month. But more importantly than that, he has decided to leave the board
towards year end, and the successor as announced will be Christoph Jurecka. There is no
strategic impact that we should expect from this. The reason why I mentioned this I think
is only correct and fair that I mentioned it after it had only been announced after the
supervisory board meeting mid-July, and all the acknowledgments, Jörg, you're going to
hear very comprehensively then towards the year-end.

Bloomberg Transcript

News number two colleagues was a small structural adjustment with regard to the board
responsibilities in the reinsurance area. There the specialty businesses like aviation, like
space, marine, credit, agri, et cetera, since the beginning of this month, they have been
reallocated to the regional divisions where most of the marketing or market activity is
actually happening. Plus, the German market falls now into the responsibility of the
business division Europe and Latin America, and Doris Höpke is leading this business
division since last week.
And news number three is Munich Re's focus in climate activities. You all know that the
energy transformation, the transformation away from fossil energy consumption towards
non-fossil energy consumption is crucial for the achievement of the 2 degrees centigrade
target as defined by the Paris Agreement. And 90% practically of all the fossil energy
consumption needs to replace between now and 2050 to achieve this target. As you can
imagine, new non-fossil climate-friendly energies they will bear new and potentially also
higher risks that will seek insurance/reinsurance.
Munich Re with all its competencies, with all its risk appetite, has proven that we are there
when we are needed. Evidence is the output insurance that we have offered in the
context of photovoltaic power, and we are going to enable any of the other new energies
there are apt to come. This is so key. This is our priority. But besides this enabling,
enabling the energy transformation priority, we have also precise our disabling activities
with regard to coal. As you know coal carries the highest CO2 emissions. And by 2050,
practically 80% of the carbon in the world would need to stay in the ground and not be
used. So we think that it wouldn't match if we will continue to insure/reinsure new carbon
power stations which typically have a lifespan of 50 years or even longer.
So that's why we have decided to divest from any equity or loan investment into
industries or companies that generate more than 30% of their revenues with coal. Plus, as
a matter of principle, we will no longer insure and/or reinsure new coal power stations or
mines, and this with regard to the facultative, with regard to the single-risk business
where we actually have the possibility to not only see but also assess the risk. All that said,

FINAL

there will be only a few exceptions to this, all very well-defined on the basis of very
restrictive criteria.
First off, I make this comment because there had been a recent more public debate
around all this topic, and I wanted to let you know our positioning. And to my feeling, I
think this has been perceived broadly pretty well so far. So now let me turn to offering you
my executive summary for the first half year results. The overall result is really good, and it
suggests that we should reach our resolved target for the full year, so to reach the range
€2.1 billion to €2.5 billion. When it comes to the composition of the result, the composition
suggests that the reinsurance segment, life and non-life, performed well.
On the P&C Re side, it's better than expected with the actual combined ratio, first half
year of 95.5%. However, the combined ratio of 102% in Q2 only at first side felt a little bit
on the high side to us as well. So that's why we had a deeper look into it ourselves, and
what we found out is that the actual claims experienced, as highlighted by Jörg in his
podcast, explains actually a big part of that. If we ask ourselves, was there any evidence
of that underwriting, clearly, no. So our judgment is it's then bad luck, and we have nothing
to blame ourselves, and if there was, we would.

Bloomberg Transcript

And then there was the next question, has there been any recent growth activity that
suggest that we have done so on the basis of a soft and and say, underwriting approach,
and the clear answer is simply no. There have been structured deals. Those who also
reach a volume range of sometimes three-digit million euro premium income. They by
nature tend to have combined ratios closer to 100% than for example, the nat cat
business, but all of them good and attractive, good underwriting.
The rest is some seasonality in the claims experience with regard to the U.S. business,
more concretely, to the (00:08:57) business, which is well understood by us and happens
in half year one rather than in half year two. So all-in-all, our firm assessment and
judgment is the P&C result is very solid. So a lower than expected underwriting result but
good underwriting. And on the life re side, we had a very strong first half year as reported
by Jörg. And if you want, we can go deeper into it during the Q&A.
Plus, ERGO delivered in a very solid way with a particularly strong ERGO International
business. So from all these angles, we can only say we are happy with a pretty good first
half year 2018. It goes so far that we actually asked ourselves at the board and said, with
the first half year result that corresponds to more than 60% of the committed full-year
results, is the reason that we should probably adjust our result indication upwards, and our
response is a very clear no. And the reason why I think they were offered in the podcast
from Jörg saying, we know that on an expected basis, probably the second half year will
not be as strong as the first half year. Nat cat in Q3 is the reason, the low tax rates in first
half year are another reason, et cetera. And that's why we say no. But I dare saying that as
it stands now and on the basis of an ongoing normal evolution of claims but also of capital
markets, we think that we would stand rather in the upper half of that range than in the
lower half.
So far my summary, and I hand back to Christian.

Thank you, Joachim. So we can now start with the Q&A. We will go right into it and I'd like
to remind you to restrict the number of your questions to two per person as always.
Thank you. And please go ahead. Looking forward.

Q&A
Operator
Our first question today comes from James Shuck of Citi. Please go ahead.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. The first question is really around the
exposure growth that came through up to the July renewals, in particular plus 41%. I think
you mentioned the Australian (00:12:09) had some stuff in the U.S. It's very difficult to get
a picture of the underlying growth. Obviously, the rate environment hasn't really changed.
If I look through some of those large numbers, it still looks like you've grown quite
significantly without a real material change in the pricing environment. So could you just
flesh out a little bit more about where the exposure growth is coming from, please.
Second question is sort of conceptual one. I'm interested just to understand a bit more
about how you're managing your peak apparel exposures. I think, the PMLs up to full year
haven't really shown that much change over time in terms of your exposures, whether
that's to Atlantic hurricanes. I think there was definitional change at full year from LA
earthquake to North American earthquake. But at the same time, you do talk about using
retro more, and you've given some interesting extra disclosure over time. So I guess the
question is, how should we think about the packaging risk, and perhaps for you to emerge
as just really kind of more of a passing on of that risk to some of the financial markets,
particularly as we move through up to the July year-to-date renewals. And just kind of
connected with that very loosely at least is, if it would be possible to get some kind of
guidance around the net earned premium expectation for full year because we can't see
– the GWP is growing very strongly year-to-date, but obviously (00:13:39) net earned,
that's very difficult to forecast and will have an impact on the combined ratio. Thank you
very much.

A - Joachim Wenning

{BIO 16273429 <GO>}

James, I will take the first one, and Jörg maybe take the second one and the third one
with regards to net earned premium expectations for the full year. So where is the growth
coming from? As you said, roughly half of the absolute growth volumes, they are related
to a large structure deal, one that we already know which has been renewed, and the
other half is going back to growth impacts or I would even call it growth successes in
those regions or those areas where we want it to grow. So we have explicitly said, we
have a growth appetite primarily in the established markets in the U.S., maybe in the
broking segments, also with regard to regional clients because historically, we have been
there relatively on the way compared to our global market share, and this is where we
have seen some growth. But then, we have also said, we see growing in emerging
Page 4 of 23



Company N ame: M uenchener Rueckversicherungs-Gesellschaft AG in M uenchen
Company Ticker: M UV2 GR Equity
Date: 2018-08-08

markets. Take for example, in the ERGO segment and we see growth there. So one half
of it is due to one large transaction, and it shows a high increase rate because we didn't
have any piece of this 12 months back. Have we compared the growth by 1.7 with 1.1
(00:15:35), the growth rate would have been smaller. Jörg, I hand over to you.

FINAL

A - Jörg Schneider
Yeah. Thank you, Joachim. Good afternoon. How do we manage our peak risks? The
growth part which Joachim described is well in line with our risk appetite, and we do not
have increased budgets for risks. And so there's slightly higher usage of these budgets at
the moment, but mostly due to currency effects because the euro has become a little bit
weaker in comparison to the U.S. dollar, and that has been the main driver also for our risk
capital in the last three months. So therefore there's absolutely not a quantum step with
regard to our risk exposure. And there are also no major changes with regard to our retro
coverage. With regards to your third question about net earned premiums, so it's a little
bit difficult even for us at the moment with this strong growth from the renewals to see
the impact. But as a rule of thumb, I would say it should be roughly €18 billion for property
casualty reinsurance, including primary insurance out of reinsurance. Is this okay, James?

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. That's helpful. I mean, I guess, just on the exposure to peak parallels, I guess, my
point is that you've increasingly used the retro market as to kind of pass on that risk. And
it's not coming through in the PML. And then I take your point that there is an FX impact.
But I just would expect the PML exposures to come down given that great uses of retro.
But if you're saying it's kind of on an underlying basis, it's kind of broadly stable and I take
that, I suppose.

A - Jörg Schneider
And James, it has been a more opportunistic usage of the retro market, but no major
change here, especially not such an enormous increase. We use more sidecars than we
did in the past. But the traditional retro has reduced to the same extent. Therefore, it's
more or less an unchanged policy here.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Yeah. Okay. Thank you very much.

A - Jörg Schneider
Thank you, James.

Thank you very much. I have two questions. First one is on the topic of the ZZR, so
Generali Leben said that these ZZR might get to lease and they'd get some money back
on the Generali Leben deal. And I just wondered if you can give an idea of how much the –
what the sensitivity would be for Munich Re if there were a change in these rules? And I
suppose the second question and probably a bit annoying for you, how much assurance
do you have that the quality of the business is the same? I mean, the growth rates
whether Q1 or I mean January or now are very high, and you've looked at it and you say,
well, it's good, but we don't know. When will we find out if the growth is really good value,
and it'll produce earnings, or how long do we have to wait to be sure? And have you
taken in any extra kind of precautionary measures like adding to reserves or whatever for
that? Thank you.

A - Jörg Schneider
Michael, first on the ZZR, the original rules had been somewhat over-calibrated, and after
now I think four years or five years of building up of the ZZR there's an urgent need for
change, and I'm confident that we will see that change in the course of this year that we
see a change in rules towards what is called a corridor method. The impact is still difficult
to estimate for the market. We do not expect the ZZR to be reduced from that moment
on, but we will not have a similar need for an increase, and therefore, we would be very
happy if this rule change will take place very soon.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And if you don't have the increase, is there a kind of what is the benefit to the group?

A - Jörg Schneider
The benefit at the moment is mostly that we do not have to realize a valuation reserve on
our investment portfolio to the same extent as we did. And you can see that already in
the Q2 numbers that we stood on the break here.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Joachim Wenning

{BIO 16273429 <GO>}

Maybe I add one thing, Jörg, that is the benefit to the market and it's not an economical
benefit yet, but it gives them some relief that is, that with the new rule for building the
ZZR, the buildup of the ZZR that has been happening for some years and would continue
continuing for a short while, that would mean a very sharp increase in the build-up of ZZR
this year and next year, I'm not sure 2020, but I'm sure this year and next year. And then a
very sharp release of the ZZR reserves, and this new rule would bring that the buildup get
softened or smoothened out a little bit, but then also the future release will be slightly
shorter. So it's just smoothening impact of the buildup in the release of the ZZR reserve.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Joachim Wenning

{BIO 16273429 <GO>}

Quality of business assurance was another question of yours, Michael. So why are we
confident that the business that we have written, that shows growth in our books is of
good quality. For a big chunk of the business, we can explicitly state that because we have
looked into it with all divisions. Why is that? As I said, one half of that is one structured deal
is one. I mean, it's so large into this one, I would say, everybody in this group looks into it.
So if you're confident that when everybody looks into it then the quality is good, then you
can be comfortable. Plus, not a big chunk, but also some smaller but also structural deals
which typically gets submitted into central capital centers are also approved by them. Plus
when it comes to the specialty businesses like ERGO, they follow a pretty central
approach, meaning, the underwriting rigor by nature and by structure is very high, and
only the smaller part of that growth if you like is decentrally written, but it's no other
business than that, that we have seen in previous year only that'll be right a little bit more
of that.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

And has there been – have you been extra careful on the reserving yield?

A - Jörg Schneider
You mean overall with the basic loss reserve?

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

No. Well I suppose (00:23:37), well either on this one, on the (00:23:40) in Colombia, it
feels like you kind of rejoice, and you're so, I double the numbers.

A - Jörg Schneider
Yeah. That can be – I can't exclude that. You know that we tend to be on the somewhat
more careful side, and that explains perhaps part of the difference between us and some
peers at the moment. But it's difficult for myself to make a judgment because as you
know, we always reserve for the best estimate.

Company Ticker: M UV2 GR Equity
Date: 2018-08-08

Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two from me. So I mean, firstly, the 2020
net income ambition is in part based on some combined ratio improvement driven by
growth in shorter tail lines. I wonder, does this growth we're seeing in structured
reinsurance products, I appreciate it's just one, but this come with a structurally high
combined ratio. So does this make it harder to drive that planned improvement in the
combined ratio particularly given the pricing environment is fading a little bit, or does it
mean you need to grow by even more than initially planned in shorter tail lines which
would obviously be quite challenging today? That's the first question.
And secondly, I guess, just going back to the growth and how you get comfortable with
that. I know it's a bit repetitive, but I think it's an important area today. I mean, how can
investors get comfortable with the profitability of this recent growth given we're seeing
deterioration today in the headline result. There's been an outsized manmade loss which
we're not used to from Munich Re. And it's also been accompanied with normalized
combined ratio deterioration as well. So I guess just to go over your thoughts again there,
please. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Joachim Wenning

{BIO 16273429 <GO>}

So Jörg, I will start with the first question. So with regard to the 2020 net income, you're
right that the expectation for 2020 is based on the assumption that the combined ratio
will probably go down to a level of 97% on P&C Re. That means that some short tail
business will have to make a contribution, whereas, structured deals alone, they couldn't
provide that. They couldn't provide the whole result contribution, but they also would lead
to typically higher than 97% combined ratios. That's why structured deals are only one part
of the new business portfolio that we are seeking, but it's not the major part. The major
part is shorter tail business, as for example, we see in the U.S. market. But also, don't
forget that we expect ERGO to also increase its contribution to the group by some €250
million between this year and then 2020. Both components will pay into it. Jörg?

A - Jörg Schneider
Yes. You asked Jonny, you asked about how can investors get comfortable with this
strong growth. So if I look at our numbers and all the internal material where do you –
where you do not have access to, that it clearly points to substantially increased
profitability, including the interest rate effect. So markets are not softening, but they are
slightly hardening at the moment. First remark. Second, when you look at the adjusted
combined ratio, we are also not in use about the 100.3 in the first half but there is really
clear evidence in the numbers that beside some accounting noise which comes from
earning patterns, currency impacts and things like that which are explainable but very
difficult to present to the public.
There's this impact of the major losses below the $10 million line which come from our
primary insurance activities in the United States, mostly referring to tornadoes,
thunderstorms and these types of mid-sized events. And they also appeared in the last
couple of years. So we had this seasonal pattern and I believe that this is really something
which we'll get reversed in the second half. And third remark on that, that is my personal
experience. There is not at all any change in the reserve quality. That means there are
really I wouldn't call it buffer, yeah, but wherever we have an estimation range, we use it in

a somewhat conservative way as far as rules permit. And this also happens for these
major structure tiers, this happens for all the areas where we want to grow, like Joachim
said before, it's highly controlled by central functions, and therefore, there's not this –
what would worry me is this broad aggressive underwriting behavior because we want to
grow.
Now, it's absolutely not that. It's precisely explainable more or less year by year. And that
makes me at least confident, and I hope that I share a little bit of that comfort with you.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Great. Thanks very much.

Our next question today comes from Vinit Malhotra of Mediobanca.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Thank you very much. So I think some of the topics have been addressed. Thank you.
But I guess if I can talk about two more things, one is the running income or the regular
income which I understand is coming from increased corporate bond, emerging markets,
higher U.S. rates.
I mean, if – out of these three, probably the emerging markets is the more volatile one.
But Jörg, just a sense of how much would you say is sort of a one-off-ish effect in this very
strong (00:30:26) P&C Re has almost €83 million higher running income in 2Q versus 2Q
last year. So how much should we think about this running income?
And also, on the Life Re, I mean, I think in 1Q we had been flagged that there was – the fall
in premiums was coming from a treaty which was canceled. But is it the same effect in
2Q? And this doesn't seem to be – is this really driving the very strong technical result as
well, and how should we think about the technical results this year for Life? Thank you very
much.

A - Jörg Schneider
Hello, Vinit. First, on the running yield, the regular income from our investments, as you
said, it's coming from small increase of corporate bonds and somewhat lower focus on
government bonds, but that is not a major development, also not the emerging markets
impact. We've always been somewhat active in emerging market fixed interest
instruments. You ask about one-off-ish effect, and I confirm – I can confirm that there are
some in this reinvestment yield of 2.8% in reinsurance, this mainly comes from fixed
interest securities. And there is an element of a strong restructuring of our portfolio in U.S.
life reinsurance.
And this goes along with the lengthening of duration and benefited from the increase in
yields for government bonds, as well as for corporate bonds. And I cannot promise that

FINAL

this will be repeated to the same extent in the two incoming quarters. So I would
personally expect for the reinvestment yield, with unchanged markets, a little bit lower
than for Q2, but still on a level which is substantially higher than for the preceding quarter.
So somewhere between 2% and 2.3% perhaps in the upper half of that range.
And another effect was, therefore, our associated companies, due to the U.S. tax reform,
there was a revaluation of (00:33:08) in these companies and we had our share in the
profit which comes in as running yield and that was in a way a small one-off effect, not
important to mention, but I should have said it when you asked so precisely. So to
summarize, it's a good environment and we expect the level between 2.7% and 2.8% to
persist, perhaps second quarter was a little bit on the upper end of the reasonable range
for future reinvestments. Joachim?

A - Joachim Wenning

{BIO 16273429 <GO>}

Yeah, thanks, Vinit. This is Joachim. So the fall in premiums on Life Re side, this can be
explained by two effects, very clearly. So it's structured transactions and typically those
structures they are designed to hold for a period that is limited for three years, four years
or five years, because both the client and ourselves, we agree that's the time period for
which we seek the financial impact for what it was designed. And beyond that period,
nobody knows if that need would still exist.

Bloomberg Transcript

One of these transactions still ended by that time and didn't get renewed because need
wasn't there. Had it been renewed, technical result would have even been higher than the
one we show.
The second phenomenon is, again, same type of structured transaction, but one which
got renewed, but got renewed in a completely different structure than before where the
previous structure was volume intense, the new structure isn't any longer, with absolutely
no negative impact on technical results, if at all, rather on the contrary. So you cannot
possibly conclude that the high technical result would have gone back to some
divestment from this type of transactions.

We will now take a question from Thomas Seidl of Bernstein. Please go ahead.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you. Good afternoon. First, on ERGO you say it's well on track on the
turnaround. It seems though that the Life business is a bit lagging expectations. When I
look at the operating expenses, they seem to be up 11% at half-year year-on-year. So I
wonder if you could comment on beyond the lower gains that you outlined in the webcast.
Basically, what has been driving the lower operating result of Life Germany?

Secondly, large losses, you say you have nothing to be blamed for. I just wonder if you
could comment on whether those large losses, which are €320 million above the longterm average, come from the Risk Solutions business, which has been grown close to
20% over the last years. And also, if you have nothing to blame, should that not just mean
that we go from a 4% to, let's say, a 5% load for the combined ratio going forward if this
is sort of a normal quarter every now and then?
And thirdly, if I may, on the CFO, you say no strategic impact from the change. So I just
wonder, Jörg, if I could ask you because you will be around for longer, how we should
think about the growth in absolute dividend next year, assuming you're now more
confident you say in the webcast you achieved €2.3 billion, €2.4 billion net income this
year. What would drive your decision by how much to increase the absolute dividend next
year given the capital is still enormously strong?

A - Joachim Wenning

{BIO 16273429 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. I – Thomas, let me start with the large losses, if you like. I'd like just – Jörg and
colleagues, if you can research if there is more to say than what I know from the top of my
head. So does this come from Risk Solutions business? Thomas, that was one of your
questions, and the answer is no. That's very classical, very traditional business, the large
losses.
Let me add maybe one aspect, because I'm hearing and I was – I'm hearing from this
conference call, but also from before that it is somehow surprising that our share in the
Colombian claim seems over proportionately high. And in fact, it is. There is a reason
which I cannot possibly disclose to you because it's client-specific. So there is one-half of
that claim that typically is placed in the market and we, as Munich Re, we would have our
fair market share in such a claim, as the other reinsurers would have.
And there was a second part of this claim, where we have an exclusive and 100% of that.
So the over-proportionate share of us is totally understandable to us. We simply cannot
disclose it.
With regard to the CFO – you didn't say CFO impact on dividends but you ask for
guidance with regard to future dividends and what would drive us defining the dividend
level going forward. Trust me, it's too early. So we would principally, if you ask me at this
point, we would exactly apply the same set of criteria on the basis of which we would
decide how much the dividend should be set. But the most important thing is, we have to
have the full-year result first. And for this, we really need to wait for quarter one to know
the full result, and then we are very happy to share that guidance with you.

A - Jörg Schneider
On your first question with regard to the ERGO operating expenses, especially in Life, it's
a bit difficult for me to answer it in an appropriate way at the moment, because translating
the German GAAP-driven business model into IFRS very often leads to surprising results
also for ourselves. It has to do most probably with cost allocation between the various
segments, especially with the high expenses for the strategy program itself. So we have

enormous expenses in IT at the moment. Perhaps, I come back during the call with more
information. But at the moment, I would ask you to bear with me, because I can't give you
a reliable answer on that.

Okay. Maybe if I can follow-up on that dividend. Of course, we know that we have to wait
for Q3 and Q4. But at the full-year number this year, it was said that you are going to grow
the absolute payout in line with earnings. So my question was, with the CFO change, are
you sticking to this promise?

Q - Vikram Gandhi

{BIO 18019785 <GO>}

Hi. Thank you for the opportunity. I've got two questions. Firstly, given where the industry
pricing is and given how the shift in strategy on cost cutting and business mix changes
have evolved so far, what does it do to your confidence with respect to the 2020 outlook
or guidance? Are you more confident, less confident about the 2020 guidance? And
secondly, how are you seeing the HIM losses developing? And is there anything there that
gives you comfort about the combined ratio and profitability over the full-year? Thank you.

A - Joachim Wenning

{BIO 16273429 <GO>}

So thank you, Vikram. Your question with regard to the confidence level, the way that I am
comfortable answering such questions is the following. When we are into the first year of
three years commitment and we see that in that first year we are progressing as we
expected, then my confidence level is higher than it is at the very beginning of that threeyear period. So, in this sense, it's at least as high as it was six months back. Jörg?

Bloomberg Transcript

Oh, hi, there. Joachim, I wonder if you could give us a bit more qualitative color on how
the new product range is being received at ERGO. I mean, the size talk about that the
new products are in place. It's very hard to see any sort of traction in new business
momentum from the figures you disclosed. So maybe a bit more color on the new
business, well, how are new products going down, both Life and Non-Life in Germany
specifically?
Second question, there's been a bit of reorganization on the reinsurance reporting lines,
as you've already discussed. Is anything happening on the primary Risk Solutions
business? There have been various trade press reports about changes with your Lloyd's
operation. But maybe just clarify, is anything happening on sort of restructuring, particularly
the Risk Solutions business?
Well, final point, isn't a question, it's just to clarify, Jörg, on the ZZR changes, I appreciate
there's a net present value change because the timing of ZZR additions changes, but I
don't think the total quantum changes. So I'm not sure it's actually an economic benefit.
And also presumably you're right, for us, earnings will go down because you'll be realizing
less gains. Is that not the case? Thanks.

A - Joachim Wenning

{BIO 16273429 <GO>}

Thank you, Andrew. So with regard to the new product ranges at ERGO, so ERGO has
started modernizing, if you like, or if not bringing totally new P&C products starting with
car insurance products to the market, then household insurance, personal liability
insurance, et cetera. If you look into the rankings of these products as offered by some of
the professional ranking institutes or ranking companies, then they are highly ranked,
which is one indicator. It's not all. When you look into how is the productivity of the sales
forces in the last 12 months, so mid-year this year compared to mid-year last year, how
has that evolved? It has increased by 14%. So this is another indicator.

FINAL

New products on the P&C side are having a positive impact on production level. New
products also with regard to complementary health insurance is having a positive impact,
where ERGO has just started. I wouldn't say lagging behind, but it comes up with it now as
a second priority is new products in Life, and we hope that they will also have a positive
impact.
Your second question was with regard to any restructuring plans in the Risk Solutions area.
None at all.

A - Jörg Schneider
Except for changes which are necessary due to Brexit. So there will be some
reorganization on the London market, but it does not refer to our Lloyd's business.

Bloomberg Transcript

With the ZZR, Andrew, here you are right that there is a small value change, net present
value change for the business due to lower reserve requirements under local German
GAAP, but the impact will not be enormous. With regard to the impact on IFRS earnings, if
we have to realize less valuation reserves on our investments, that means that we have
lower impact also on our IFRS earnings. But these earnings are of very low quality. So, I'm
absolutely not disappointed about that development. And, therefore, we anyway look at
the ZZR requirement, including these capital gains as being in overall negative, in line with
the economic impact. So, therefore, we will have to replace these earnings, but we are
not forced doing it year-by-year at a pace which is clearly above the economic
requirements. And it allows us, so a relieve of the ZZR rules allow us to better manage
the business in the interest of stability and in the interest also of shareholders. Therefore,
it's a small but important net positive.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

So it wouldn't affect your expectations for 2020 ERGO Life contribution?

A - Jörg Schneider
That's any way a moving target, yeah, because we made all these plans in the year 2016,
and up to now we've been very consistent and the delivery is quite strong, but
nevertheless, it is so difficult to predict and forecast all these enormous expenses and
earnings. We are very happy that the expense savings come in. That it's important that
the reorganization of the sales forces has been successful, and that there's very good
momentum, but you will continue seeing deviations in the numbers that is unavoidable.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Hi. Just wanted to talk about cyber base (00:49:10). You called out in your growth
initiatives piece, talking about continued growth in the first half of the year, is it okay to get
an update on, I guess, premiums and if you have the number of reserves that you have
set aside for cyber? Second, (00:49:29) kind of the loss ratio, you're booking this at the
moment or kind of any comments on the claims experience year-to-date?
And, I guess, the third part of the question is, if you do get to the 10% market share, so
that €800 million to €1 billion, how comfortable are you with the aggregates and will we
end up with some kind of cyber PML disclosure? Thanks.

A - Jörg Schneider
So, first of all, we would not share the loss ratios with the market. They are somewhat
lower than for our average business because there were – there's only very small number
of incidents. We also set up IBNR, but only for claims which had occurred here, not for
future claims, that is for sure.

Bloomberg Transcript

With regard to our market share, it's a little bit below the 10%. So, the 10% was in the
starting phase. Currently, we would see between 8% and 9% and the wider and the
broader the market gets, we try to grow in alignment with market growth, but we would
also be very happy if the market grows so dramatically that there's place for more
suppliers here.
And with regard to the PML, at the moment, it is a very substantial scenario, the cyber
event scenario, the accumulation of risk, but it's still far below our exposure for pandemics
in life insurance or from Atlantic hurricane and from the other major most exposed
periods in property-casualty reinsurance. But it's a valid point. It's important and it's
observed with a lot of conservatism, perhaps there would also be room for, let's say, a
more generous modeling of the risk. At the moment, we try to stay on the very tough
side which also increases the cost of capital as you can imagine.

Good afternoon. Two questions, one on the life re side, could you may be potentially
comment if we have to have in mind any big recapturing you may have started to
negotiate and something that we have to keep in mind for H2? I know that you are doing
this on a regular basis, but anything sizeable which might be in the pipe?
And second question would be related to the PC re pricing. So, midyear, you're achieving
0.9%, but actually the cat exposure on the loss-affected contract renewing at midyear
where we see probably significantly higher than the start of the year. So obviously the mix
should have driven the average price increase higher. So, I'm not talking of increasing
momentum, but the mix should have brought higher price increase. So, if you're getting
that on the loss-affected business which have been renewed, where is the missing gap
and where potentially you have been facing already significant or I would say lower pricing
or declining prices already at midyear? Thank you.

A - Joachim Wenning

{BIO 16273429 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Thank you, Thomas. We do not actually budget the life re recaptures. But we
continue going after recaptures as part of what we call the in-force management ambition
of our colleagues in the life re space. Is there anything concrete that at this point we could
announce? There isn't. Otherwise, we would have done so. Can we exclude that
recapture transaction is going to happen in Q3 or in Q4? Can be. We don't push for it.
When there is a win-win possibility, an economic win-win for both client and ourselves,
then we will go after it.
Maybe I should add one thing, in case that these recaptures happen and if we believe
that the track record, historic track record is a good indicator into the future, then for
recapture, you would expect an impact of something like a low-to-mid double-digit million
amount.
With regard to P&C repricing, you cite the 0.9% increase and would have expected
because of a more beneficial, if you like, to be renewed portfolio structure higher impact,
what you should also take into account, please, is the large contracts and they dilute this
picture.

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Actually, two questions. First question on P&C re
and again on the large – on the structured large quota share business. As you mentioned,
they come with a combined ratio closer to 100%. And all else being equal, your
normalized combined ratio going forward should go up. Can you give us some
Page 16 of 23

FINAL

information about how this effect will be in the calendar year 2019? And should we still
think or assume large losses being normalized at 12% of net earned premiums if net
earned premiums include so much premiums from the large transactions?
Second question, on your 2020 guidance, €2.8 billion, from ERGO €530 million, from Life
and Health Germany €90 million, and if I remember correctly, this is composed of life
minus €90 million, so a loss and health €180 million plus. Is the minus €90 million for
German life still realistic? It comes at a time when interest rates even in Germany were
lower than they are today. The assumptions regarding (00:56:40) participations have
probably changed and we have the ZZR change in the methodology ahead of us. So,
what should we think about this minus €90 million?

A - Jörg Schneider
Michael, thank you for these questions. Let me start with the last one that is difficult. It
could be that we come out a little bit more favorable, but it was mentioned before
correctly that there's also an impact from lower ZZR requirements which do no longer
force us to the same extent to realize IFRS relevant capital gains. So therefore, this could
be a countervailing effect. It's too early for me to say that here.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, as I said before, it's so difficult to forecast these numbers. We can say wherever we
have a substantial deviation from what had been planned before, it's rather on the high
side then on the low side, but don't dream – at least, I don't dream of big numbers here.
Then, on your question on property-casualty reinsurance, these large quota share deals
come in with combined ratios which are definitely higher than the 97% we are striving for.
But I don't care, yeah. So as long as they are profitable with all respect which means in
IFRS and especially also on an economic basis, it's fine because possibly they come on
top of what we earn elsewhere. Therefore, they make me more confident to achieve our
targets instead of less confident.
With regard to the large losses, difficult to answer whether the 12% is still a good
guidance. Man-made losses had been somewhat higher, nat-cat losses somewhat lower,
but remember 2017 when we had the huge impact from the large losses from natural
catastrophes, 2017 will come again hopefully not very soon. So, still in our interim
numbers, this ballpark percentage range of 12%, it seems to be valid. Most probably, our
absolute number will be higher than €2 billion because our net earned premium is strongly
growing at the moment. Therefore, there are no major changes. And overall, it's a very
healthy picture. And by the way, the large deals don't come in at 100%. Yeah, they come
in below 100%, so somewhere between 97% and 100%, perhaps in the middle or so.

Q - Frank Kopfinger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes. Good afternoon, everybody. I have also one question for your ERGO 2020 target.
One driver is obviously the 92% combined ratio for German P&C business. And I was
wondering whether you see some headwinds here as the portfolio mix shift is still going
on, i.e. the accident business is at the lowest level which you ever had. And on the other
side, motor business is thriving, which is probably coming also in the buyer price
comparison websites. So, any thoughts on this portfolio shift and your 92%?
And the other question is on your asset management business. There has been some
speculation that you're looking for a partner for your AM activities. Can you please
comment on what your strategy for the business is and any thoughts which help us to
understand your logic?

A - Joachim Wenning

{BIO 16273429 <GO>}

Yeah. Let me start with the second one, and Jörg, I don't know if you take the – take it?
Yeah. I'll take the second one with regard to asset management business, Frank.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, we have clarified – after some rumors have been articulated in the press, we have
clarified that the investment function is for us, an important value lever, both on the
reinsurance side, but also on the primary insurance side. I'm emphasizing this statement
because in some media, we had to read something like we're going to divest from
investment, so nonsense.
The second statement is that we are happy with MEAG and their asset management
performance. Yet, we continuously would compare and challenge the proprietary asset
management to asset management capabilities externally. So if in a defined asset class,
an external manager focusing on that asset class with a large scale in this asset class
could outperform MEAG, then to us, it's very logical that we would consider at least
partnering with that asset manager. This is frankly what I'd like to state. Anything else is
just in the realm of rumors.

A - Jörg Schneider
With regard to the business mix, Frank, the 92% is ambitious. I can confirm that especially
also because the accident business is currently not growing, but rather shrinking. But this is
not an one-sided development. So, we are confident that we can also stimulate the
accident business going forward. With regard to the motor business, what comes from
the comparison sites that is mostly (01:02:46) business. Most business apart from that in
motor comes from our own sales forces and it increases the loyalty of the client and for
us, it is also important to be more present in motor business in order to then provide our
clients with the broader, more modern product portfolio we had set up in the last couple
of months.
So therefore, we are confident that we can run the motor book in a way that is not value
destructing, but profitable and that we can improve our client coverage also using motor
business, but not only. So therefore overall, we are still confident that this is not an
obstacle, but rather tailwind for our ambitious targets for 2020 and going forward.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hello. Thank you very much. First, well, sticking with ERGO, sorry, but I'm still not quite clear
about why we shouldn't annualize the first half results of €185 million. So, can you just give
us an indication of what should be dragging ERGO? I mean, I understand the large losses
on the reinsurance side. But you said that they are – said that it all seems to be tiny,
realized gains were already light in the first half. So, I'm not sure why you shouldn't
annualize that. To the extent that the answer is restructuring costs, can you just remind us
what they were in the first half and what they could be in the second half ?
And then secondly, on the Solvency II ratio, the figure is up about 5 percentage points. I
think you said in your prepared remarks that's all operating and nothing to do with
markets. So, can I just clarify two things? Just technically speaking, that number is not
depressed by any accrual of capital distribution because the dividend or the buyback all
comes at the end of the year, so the 5 points is just a clean number? And then more
importantly, how much comes from own funds going up and how much comes from SCR
going down assuming it did? What's the split between numerator and denominator?
Thank you.

A - Jörg Schneider
Thank you, William. Why you shouldn't annualize the ERGO profits, a couple of reasons.
One is large losses were on average lower in spite of the storm, Friederike, in the first
half. Second is we do not expect high capital gains in the second half, if the ZZR rules
come in as expected. Third, we had a positive tax effect in the first half, which we
mentioned in the first quarter. And third, the gain from disposal of our DAS Switzerland
was substantial and we do not expect similar sales going forward.
Second, with regards to our economic solvency ratio, the plus 5% is a clean number.
There's no accumulation of dividend. We haven't changed our methodology here. But I
would like to emphasize that the capital management, that means the dividend and the
share buyback of the second quarter has already been deducted as of end of Q4. Yeah.
So, there was no impact from that. What was happening there was, first with regard to the
solvency capital requirement, it went up slightly, first due to a small, very small impact
from a higher exposure; second, from currency effect. It was mostly currency effect. But
the eligible own funds increased to a larger extent and that was due to the operating
earnings in spite of the negative influence from major losses in reinsurance, which were
above expectation, but not far above. But this was overcompensated by positives.

One was favorable development in our in-force portfolio in life and some experience
variances in reinsurance life and with ERGO. And we had market variances which were
largely offsetting each other in a volatile environment, positive currency effects, and the
developments on our equity portfolio, as well as the investments in real estate and
infrastructure positive. And on the negative side for the economic developments, we had
the aggregate changes of risk-free interest rates. That means up in the United States, but
down in Europe, and the widening of credit spreads which was the most important impact.
Overall, moderate increase in eligible own funds on a small increase on solvency capital
requirement.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

So, just to follow-up briefly. To the extent that your P&C book has grown quite significantly,
the fact that the SCR hasn't gone up much. Is that telling us that there's no capital strain
from your P&C growth, or is it something being offset (01:08:12) life re going down or
something?

A - Jörg Schneider
There is only a small increase in capital requirement for P&C on a currency-adjusted basis
and some relief – and increase from currency, yeah, so both. Both going upwards, but it
was tiny.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Right. Thank you very much.

A - Jörg Schneider
And there was a question for the restructuring expenses, that is – not restructuring. We
call it investments here because they are not booked as restructuring expenses. They are
partially booked as operational expenses, partially as non-operational, but we do no
longer call it restructuring expenses. The net impact was €68 million and this is
approximately one-third of the 2018 budget.

FINAL

Second, coming to ERGO International, is there any specific reason for the deterioration
of the combined ratios in Greece and Turkey? Maybe you could shed some light on that.
Maybe as a third question, looking at the agricultural business, do you see any losses
arising here in the third quarter looking at the drought out there in Europe? Thank you.

A - Joachim Wenning

{BIO 16273429 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So, Roland, this is Joachim. With regard to ERGO IT, I would split the answer into two
parts. One is the ERGO IT with regard to the administration platform for managing the old
life back book. Here, ERGO has started or launched the cooperation with IBM to the end
in the period of two to four years which is highly ambitious to migrate into a newly to be
established and newly to be designed platform which will be then modern, which will be
efficient and which will strategically also be open to administer then third-parties' books.
That part is going well. It's onerous, it's progressing, but I'm saying it's four-years period
ahead of us. So, we progress quarter-by-quarter, but at this point in time, we are happy
with regard to the progress.
The second part of the question is and what about all the remainder of the IT work which
we would then have under the heading of new IT foundation at Ergo making the IT agile,
this is split into dozens of smaller IT projects all designed to strengthen then their
business impact. ERGO has only recently very intensively looked into, I would call it, sort of
a review of where they stand also in this regard and the review result is that they had only
to reprioritize some parts of their large project portfolio. But the key elements of them,
they continue to be – I would say, they continue to produce every confidence that they will
deliver over time. So in a nutshell, it's underway.

A - Jörg Schneider
Roland, on Turkey, this is the known phenomenon mostly due to the third-party motor
liability cap and the pool regulation, we are also suffering from like all market players and
this has a negative impact on our loss ratio. And on the other side, our gross written
premium, there's a decline coming from currency effects due to the devaluation of the
Turkish lira. Our expectation for 2018 is that the combined ratio will be in the region
between 115% and 120%. We must take into consideration that we have very high interest
income in the market, but nevertheless it's a difficult environment and we have to survive
in that environment as good as we can.
With regard to Greece, we had a significantly higher loss ratio due to the integration of
the ATE company which we bought a year ago or so then with the closing. But it even
reinforces our position in that market. So, we are very happy with the development in
Greece and we have no reason to believe that our competitiveness has been suffering
from these efforts, they are worth the price.

And your next question was about agricultural business, how much will be suffered from
the drought. So in the drought, as far as I know, mostly refers to Central Europe at the
moment to some areas. And in most of these areas, there is no coverage for drought
unlike in the United States where we have this multi-peril crop business and other
government supported schemes. We do not have such schemes in Europe and therefore
we expect losses from fires also with regard to the drought, also from the current
wildfires in California. So, the secondary effects could come in, but in the agricultural
business itself, we do not expect substantially important loss development here.

do, but unlike many others, we will provide you with a full set of information on premium
income earnings as you are accustomed to. It will be concentrated on the press release
plus the usual presentation which you know already from the last couple of quarters. We
hope that we can make your life easier with that and the level of information will be
exactly the same or more or less the same as you are accustomed to it.
Thank you very much also from Joachim's and my side and take care and a wonderful
holidays for those who have it ahead of them. Bye-bye.

Operator
This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.
