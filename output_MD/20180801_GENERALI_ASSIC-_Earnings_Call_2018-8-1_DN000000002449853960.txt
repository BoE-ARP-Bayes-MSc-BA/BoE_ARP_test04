Thank you, Spencer. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. We hope you
have had a chance to read our announcements on the organizational changes and the half
year results and to see our briefing video on the Generali corporate website. We are very
proud of the financial results we have presented today. They reflect the successful
execution of our industrial turnaround strategy as we meet or even over deliver in some
case on our pre-established targets. Our new organizational structure, on the other hand
will better position our Group to meet the challenges of the next few years.
We announced changes that make our head office simpler and more focused as well as
improve the integration among head office business units and global business lines and
involve the next strategy of value creating growth by leveraging our managerial talent.
Generali will have the structure needed for the execution of the next 2019-2021 strategic
plan, which will be presented as you know, at the Investor Day in November in Milan and
more exactly here in CityLife, where we have our new Head Officer and I'm looking
forward to welcome you there. So, thank you again for joining this call and now Luigi and I
would like to invite you to ask your questions and we will be happy to answer you. Thank
you.

Questions And Answers

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We can now take our first question from Peter Eliot
from Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you very much. The first one was on the life flows. I mean you've seen very strong
flows continuing in H1. I'm wondering if you could just sort of comment on the current
momentum you're seeing in the business and maybe the outlook and was that -- there
has been any sort of changes in the situation over the last couple of months? And then I
had a few questions on the asset management. I mean, I guess there's some very good
results that we're seeing there. I'm wondering to what extent it benefited from the
insurance mandate pricing review and what, I mean, I'm assuming there's no net benefit
to the Group, but perhaps you can correct me.
I'm wondering, how sustainable the cost-income ratio is of sort of 51%, and I mean a lot of
the prongs of your planned structure there are playing out. The only thing, we haven't
seen is maybe sort of significant growth in third-party asset and I'm just wondering if you
tell us what it was about. Thank you very much.

A - Philippe Donnet

{BIO 4657671 <GO>}

Good morning, Peter. So the first one -- momentum in life flows, indeed, we are actually -especially pleased with the inflows that we saw in the first half of this year, because that
figure, which is basically the same as the one we had in the first half of last year was
achieved, despite the fact the second quarter saw some volatility, despite the fact that
Page 2 of 21

FINAL

we're continuing to reorient our sales towards our targeted goals. And also it must be
said, despite the fact that in one of the relevant countries of the Group which is Germany,
we are in a transition phase on distribution. So, we were especially pleased for that.
In terms of the main drivers you are seeing in those figures, especially in Q2, you can see,
France, which is moving very strongly from one year to the other. That's because a year
ago, we did have some political concerns there which we no longer have this year. We
also have some tax incentives and on top of this, we have the very sales efforts of the
country, which are developing very well. We did have a strong second quarter in China and
that actually is something we look forward to in the rest of the year. Italy, despite the
reduction in savings, flows thus very well in unit linked, it renewed its catalog in the second
quarter and that should also be contributing to good performance in the second half of
the year. So, these I would say, are the main drivers. So, actually overall in terms of the
quality and trends, we are -- we are pleased with what we saw in the first half of the year.
Yes.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you very much.

A - Philippe Donnet

{BIO 4657671 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So you would like to take it. Okay. Would you like to take it. Okay. So, with regards to the
question on asset management and third party funds, our Group Chief Investment Officer
will take the question. Mr. Tim Ryan?

A - Timothy Ryan

{BIO 17528640 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone, it's Tim Ryan. Thank you for the question Peter, on the asset
management side. So, as you remember, the plan is to increase by 2020, the contribution
to the Group over 150 million net. And to your question about the different criteria and
where we stand. We are on plan. We have said that we have a linear progression and we
are on that, D&O path. The element that you raise about, if I look at the increase of the
contribution that we have on asset management to the rest of the Group on that
improvement from the first half of this year versus the first half of last year 75% is a net
contribution to the Group. So that's, to answer that question.
The other part on the cost-income ratio that you raised, our target, by 2020 is to be
below 55% and we are below 55%, the number that you raise 51% is beyond the asset
management focus on Europe, because it includes as well, the overall asset management
business, including Asia. So the focus on 55% is on Europe and we are today at 54% on
this trajectory. So just below the target and we will continue to aim to be below 55%. So
that's just enabled in merger[ph] . I hope I answered your question, Peter.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Yeah, that's great. Yeah. And thanks very much and wish you (inaudible). Thanks very
much.

FINAL

Our next question comes from Thomas Seidl from Bernstein. Please go ahead.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Thank you. Good afternoon or good morning. First question is on non-life. Pretty good
improvement in the underlying loss ratio there, despite your past comments about pricing
being in line with claims, and so I wonder what have been -- has been the driver of this
market improvement year-on-year. Any segment or regions or product been out here.
That's the first question. Second, shareholder equities significantly down and it is probably
going to continue and that increases your leverage ratio to maybe some 33%. I wonder
how you will think about the leverage ratio. Is it, at the moment at a level where you are
very comfortable or is this something you would like to address going forward? And the
third question is on the reorganization, I just wonder if you could outline or explain what
led to the decision to demote the CFO function of Generali to a third level into
management hierarchy, it's quite unusual and I just wonder what the considerations have
been for such a decision at the Generali Group. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Philippe Donnet

{BIO 4657671 <GO>}

Thanks, Thomas. Well, generally speaking, I would say that the underwriting result of the
non-life business is basically in line with the -- with what we observed in the first quarter.
We told you in the first quarter that, that quarter was exceptionally good. We stated that
would moderate but still is -- we are having a good development generally speaking on
the current loss experience, diversified across many, many countries. We do have some
especially weather-related losses. Those we have some in France. The increase, we have
an increase in loss ratio in France, because of that it's especially strong in Germany and
they somehow overshadow the good underlying performance.
There, I'm looking at my notes, but generally speaking is generalized across the board.
Simply good, good experience in terms of the loss ratio in the year. The previous years
are basically stable and so that's the main driver. We also have some savings on admin
expenses which contribute to the reduction in the combined ratio. I wonder if that covers
your question.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Yeah. Just wondering if you could elaborate maybe on Latin America, is there a particularly
positive development?

A - Philippe Donnet

{BIO 4657671 <GO>}

Well Latin America, if you remember a year ago we appropriated 40 million, because of
the inflation impact in reserves, that's actually quite interesting -- a quite useful question,
thanks for that, Thomas, because it does affect two measures there. So, if you exclude
Page 4 of 21



Company N ame: Assicuraz ioni Generali SpA
Company Ticker: G I M Equity
Date: 2018-08-01

FINAL

that the combined ratio in Latin America would have been around 103%. So, even
discounting that, the combined ratio falls year-on-year and that is due to a good
performance in Brazil. The other elements that I think interesting for you and for the other
listeners into this call is the fact that, that adjustment last year was to on let's say the prior
year's element. So actually if you adjusted for -- if you bear that in mind, the prior year's
component actually is falling year-on-year adjusting for this. So that is what went on in
Latin America. Everything, okay.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Yes, to elaborate on this evo [ph] question please.

A - Philippe Donnet

{BIO 4657671 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, sure. On the financial leverage, yes, we have the debt to equity ratio, higher than our
competitors, are we concerned about this? Not that much. Nevertheless we should do
something about this. We should work also on the cost of our debt. As you know, we
already decided to pay -- to reimburse 260 million of subordinated loan this year without
refinancing. So I think it will paired with our cash and reduce our debt to equity ratio. I
would say that this is a first step, and we will disclose our strategy -- our overall strategy
on debt management during our Investor Day on November 21st.
Talking about the reorganization of our management team, the main objective of this
reorganization is to have an organization which is functional to our new strategy. Our new
strategy will require more coordination of the different head office functions and more
coordination between head office and business units, because there will be -- compared
to the purchase plan, there will be more Group initiatives than before. So, we decided to
create this position of General Manager responsible for a significant part of the of the
head office. I decided to appoint Frederic de Courtois in this position, not only, because of
his knowledge of the business, of his deep knowledge of the insurance -- in the
reinsurance business, but also because of his strong experience in background and track
record as CFO. Frederic used to be the CFO of AXA Re Life right after September 11. So,
he has been in charge of turning around the reinsurance company that was basically
destroyed by September 11. After that he has been the CFO of AXA in Japan, who is an
important life insurance company in Japan. And he's been driving the financial turnaround
of this important life insurance company in Japan in context in environment of very low
interest rates. So I know, so many people has this kind of experience and we are -Generali is an important life insurance company in zero interest rate environment and it
happens that the few people who have this background and this experience are in
Generali and are not in the other companies.
On top of that, we appoint, because we -- is living the company we appoint Cristiano
Borean who is currently the CFO for France and Cristiano Borean is a very talented
person. He has been an excellent CFO for France. And as you remember, because you
told this many times to me during the past few years, what are you doing in France, what
are you doing in France, but as you see the numbers are much better in France and the
contribution of Cristiano as the CFO in France to the improvement of France has been
quite significant for Cristiano. He is one of the very good talents of our Group. He has a
very good track record, as the CFO of France, he is joining our Group Executive
Page 5 of 21

FINAL

Committee as the Group CFO and we are very happy to make this internal promotion,
because it's also an evidence of the depth of our management and the quality of our
management.
We don't need to find a CFO on the market, because we have the people, we have the
expertise internally. The fact that Cristiano will report to Frederic is very positive because
Cristiano will be able to benefit the strong and the deep experience of Frederic as the
CFO. The combination of the talent, the potential and the experience will be extremely
powerful. So, it's definitely not demotion of the Group CFO position. Once again this
position will be part -- is still part of our Executive Committee. And having said that, there
are a few other important financial institutions, where those in Italy and in France for
example were the Group CFO, doesn't report to the Group CEO. I could give you the
example of UniCredit in Italy and the example of BNP Paribas in France. I can comment if
you want but your question was more focused on the Group CFO. But I would be happy
to comment the rest of the organization -- the reorganization, when we will meet. And I
hope we'll have opportunities to meet quite soon.

We can now take our next question from Farooq Hanif from Credit Suisse. Please go
ahead.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi, there. Thank you very much. Just going back to the question of organizational change.
Firstly, I mean, who is going to be responsible for -- or accountable in investors eyes for
the financial strategy. So, the person that will communicate that and help to drive that, is
that going to be General Manager or CFO, is question one? My question two, given
Frederic's background and given kind of you're talking about growth initiative, does this
sort of imply that you are now more seriously looking at M&A as part of the growth plan?
And then lastly, just going back to the comment on benign experience. I know that you
had very good, kind of large loss experience in Q1 and Q2. Could you provide some sort
of quantification around what benefits it has had on the underlying loss ratio? Thank you.

A - Philippe Donnet

{BIO 4657671 <GO>}

The first question is -- difficult to understand and to answer the first question. I don't know,
which is the financial strategy. I mean we have one strategy for the Group. We are now
implementing successfully our current strategic plan. We will disclose on November 23rd
our new strategy. And with this organization we put the company in this situation to be
ready to implement successfully the new strategic plan. I guess I am responsible for the
execution of the -- for the definition, and the execution of the strategy as the Group CEO.
There is not a financial strategy independently from the Group strategy. That's the first
answer. Having said that, we have very clear position. We have a Group CFO. So the
Group CFO, is in charge of everything which is under the responsibility of the Group CFO.
He has the responsibility to sign the balance sheet of the Group and he's reporting to the
Page 6 of 21

FINAL

General Manager who is reporting to me. It's quite -- it's quite simple. So it's not very
difficult to find in our organization, people who are accountable for what we are doing well
or what we are doing wrong.
On growth we will define what we intend exactly, by growth, during the Investor Day. So to
the question, are we more seriously looking at M&A, we always said that we were looking
seriously at M&A, because for us M&A is an accelerator of the implementation of our
strategy. So, if M&A helps implementing our strategy, we look at them. If they don't help
accelerating our strategy. We don't look at them. So we are always serious when we look
at M&A. We are very opportunistic, we are very disciplined. Obviously, the difference
between now and a couple of years ago is that we have a different capital position and a
different cash position. This is absolutely true.
But the question is how are we doing to relocate these resources and we will say it during
the Investor Day. We will allocate them in a very disciplined way and in the best interest of
the shareholders.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

If I may just, sorry if I may just -- come back on what I meant by my first question. It was
more organizational in the sense that when you meet investors and when you meet the
shareholders [ph] in your Group meetings, will it be General Manager and yourself
struggling or will it be your CFO who will be part of that direct contact with investors?
Thank you.

A - Philippe Donnet

{BIO 4657671 <GO>}

Okay. Now I understand the question that those of them will meet you in some case I will
meet you together with both of them. So we will be -- the three of us, or that it will be the
two of them.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

So with regard to your question on the loss ratio, let's say, the large losses were smaller in
motor and larger in corporate and commercial. Overall kind of H1 neutralizes the other. So
it's not a major impact overall. So there is a slight -- very slight increase in the motor and
there was a decrease in motor. So overall they're satisfied.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Sorry to interrupt again to what you are saying but -- just going back on your comment,
the comment is that you've had benign experience, I mean that's what you said, but?

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Yeah, but I wasn't referring to the large claims specifically. I was referring to the loss ratio
at large. So that means that the improvement in, what is, let's say, the retail and smaller
claims component of the loss experience overcame what was the development in the
large losses.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Can you quantify that, I mean, you must say that you must have a view on where it would
be in a normalized quarter?

FINAL

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

There is no such thing as a normalized quarter, let's say that what actually to your point I
would refer to what you see now is a normalized quarter-to-quarter volatility in a year
which is providing -- proving to be good on the loss experience front. So it's -- honestly
there was nothing special to report, except for the weather losses that I already referred
to. It was just a normal quarterly development in a year, which is relatively good.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

Next question comes from James Shuck from Citi. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. Good afternoon. Three questions from me, please. Firstly on the Life
business values are up 4% at the first half of the year. If I look regionally at the breakdown
of that, there's been a very sharp decline in Germany, a decline in international, a very
large pickup in Italy. Could you just comment a little bit about on some of those trends?
And particularly on Italy, I'd just like to get some insight into the sustainability of the growth
rate of the new business profit initially. So, at some stage the banks said right -- is going
to start normalizing. And I'm just interested, now the interaction between the hybrid
products that you're selling and bank savings account. So i.e, is there a risk -- the new
business profit initially starts to decline as the interest rate environment normalizes? And
second question, as you're referring back to Q1, Luigi I had a question about the insurance
distribution directive and how that would impact life sales, particularly due to the inability
to really pay commission and enhanced disclosure. I think you said you gave me an update
at H1, so I'm just returning to that question please. Third, final question, Philippe, happy
birthday for last week. I think you're 58 years old now. Could you just remind me about the
mandatory retirement age initially as CEO and just give some reassurance that you'll
actually be around to see the full implementation of the next strategic plan? Thank you
very much.

A - Philippe Donnet

{BIO 4657671 <GO>}

If I can start with the third question. First of all, thank you very much. I'm very happy that
you thought about me last week. Yes, you're right, I'm 58. I don't know exactly about the
retirement age for heroes in Italy. I think it's very valuable by the way. So, definitely I will be
happy to present the new strategy on November during the Investor Day. I obviously
Page 8 of 21

would be very happy to be the one implementing this new strategy. As you know, the
Board have -- generally the whole Board will end at April at the next shareholders'
meeting, April or May, next year. And the whole Board will be renewed. Definitely I'm -- I
candidate to be the one to implement the next -- the next strategy. You know, I think the
next strategy will be for CEO, because you give me the opportunity to talk a little bit
about me. So, the next strategy will be quite exciting to implement.
But the next strategy is possible, because we've been implementing, what we are doing
now until the end of the year in a very disciplined way. We are now in a very different
situation and I think that we have many opportunities and we are in a situation to be able
to catch hold these opportunities. I would be happy to be the one to do it. Does it answer
your question?

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Yes. That's helpful. Thank you very much.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

So in terms of the life new business value, talking about Italy, it's I would say the variation
is mostly reflecting changes in channel mix in the sense that we have a comparatively
greater proportion of agents based sales over bancassurance that I would say is the main
driver year-on-year. Plus, as you can imagine, I mean, Italy and everywhere else, we of
course have an ongoing work on both product design emphasis on sales efforts on
certain products and also the work on the guarantees. I think basically the guarantees in
the first half have gone down to an absolute zero. So that also contributes improvements
across the places. But in case of the Italy, we had a comparatively greater weight of
agents based sale. Germany, it's -- I wouldn't be overly concerning the center. As I said
before Germany is in a transition phase, actually there are positive news from Germany, in
the sense that the move in the sales force to the new layout is actually progressing at a
faster speed than initially envisaged. So that actually is positive and you should be seeing
the outcome on that going forward.
International, basically, it's falling down because two of the companies that were sold are
there, Ireland and Guernsey, and so in those companies, we saw a reduction in sales.
Those companies also have comparatively lower margins than the rest of the Group.
That's actually another -- your question allows me to highlight another element although
here, they have not separated the bottom line is that the businesses, which you should
expect given the strategic focus on them. The overall the businesses that are leading the
ropes have lower marginality compared to what remains. So, that is also positive for the
future development of business.
As far as the IDD [ph] is concerned, simple answer, if you can accept that let's say that
with what we can see now with the present layout with the product mix, we still continue
to see scope for growth even under the new directive. So that we are not seeing any
large issues on that front, with there still room to move and grow.

FINAL

Maybe just on -- just returning to that the Italian business profits. I was just interested in
this linkage between the bank savings rates and the illustrative rates that you show within
the hybrid products standing from the traditional products, we sure kind of hooked to get
people into those products. Whether it's the IDD and commissions and disclosure in
general, or whether it's a normalization of the bank rate do you see the Italian new
business profit as being vulnerable to those trends?

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

With regards to margins, that's a question that we have been asked quarter-after-quarter.
I've always said, margins have to be taken in a context in the sense that margins are not
an absolute figure which stays there as a watermark. It's a figure that moves in relation to
market variables and competition behavior. I've always told you the same. I think what
counts is that Generali has revised both its product offering and the distribution approach
in a way that we trust positions it in any market environment at the top of its peer group.
Then of course this will move from quarter to quarter but that's -- that's the explanation,
we've always given you. Italy has a very solid distribution layout. It's our biggest strength, it
has products that are -- let's say, at the cutting edge of what can be offered today in the
market, their transparency is already very high. So, they are comparatively less exposed to
the risk perhaps than others. So, it's an overall good outlook on what we can deliver now.

Next question comes from Mark Cathcart from Jefferies. Please go ahead.

Q - Mark Cathcart

{BIO 1891927 <GO>}

Yeah. I've got two questions please. The first one is, I just wondered if you could update
on when you might get internal model approvement. There's something like a 20 gap
between standard and internal or economic solvency. And I'm wondering when you
present the market on your capital plan. We have assumptions there that the internal
model will basically be accepted or will you be more cognizant of the standard model
when discussing how much excess capital you have? That's my first question.The second
question is in relation to capital gains potential on the life business. The investment result
kind of dropped a bit in the first half. I just wondered if that was because you were taken
off guard by market volatility in the second quarter, and you intend to kind of make up the
difference during the second half of the year or is it more structure that we can expect
lower capital gains contribution within life on a going forward basis? Thank you.

Hi, Mark. So in terms of the internal model, it's similar tone. We are reasonably confident
that the approvals on the extension of the scope of internal model will be achieved over
the next few years. So that's in line with what we told you in previous releases but, let's
say, it also has to be added, that so far so good. We're, of course, keeping the interaction
with the supervisory authorities, and we are happy with the development of this
interaction. So it's going smoothly, which means that shouldn't fingers -- as far as talking
about something, we cannot -- we do not and cannot control, but let's say that the
experience so far is positive. So it should be over the next few years.
With regards to the capital gains, rather than off guard, I would say that we've been
caught on guard in the sense that the market environment was such that with the volatility
in the second quarter, it did not seem as the best moment to harvest. So given that we
can certainly withstand it as we did there wasn't any -- there was just a very prudent
approach to harvesting in Q2. I wouldn't say there's any detriments to the Group's ability
to do so going forward. As you know, generally speaking, however -- and it's a recurring
behavior of Generali so far at least over the last two years, we are taking a prudent
stance to the realization of gains. There's also an impact in terms of really the timing of
realization gains in Germany, which is a big contributor to this. And last year, there were
comparatively more realization gains in the first half of the year and that is something that
is affecting the comparison year-on-year, but as I say -- but I would say absolutely nothing
fundamental to tell you about this.

Q - Mark Cathcart

{BIO 1891927 <GO>}

Nice. So therefore you would more from Germany in the second half, is that what you're

It could be or not, it depends at this stage, it has to be assessed. I would say possibly
there could be more, but if they're going to be much more is yet to be seen. We cannot
tell you yet.

Q - Mark Cathcart

{BIO 1891927 <GO>}

Okay. And then in relation to your answer on the importance you attach to formulas to -and your internal model where you just said it will take you another two to three years to
get approval. When you present your plan and state what you believe your excess capital
position is, will you link it to formulas to or will you link it to the internal solvency models?

A - Philippe Donnet

{BIO 4657671 <GO>}

Well, I think that -- I would take that as an interesting suggestion about the information we
have to provide you at Investor Day and it's a valid recommendation to be borne in mind
when we convey that information to you. We don't yet have the documents for the
Investor Day. But this is certainly a valuable input.

Next question comes from Nick Holmes from Societe Generale. Please go ahead.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Hi, there. Thanks. With your 8 percentage points of capital generation, I wondered if you
could tell us how much comes from the release of capital from the life back book? And
what are your expectations for this to grow? I guess what I'm really wondering is, your
capital-light strategy capable of growing the 8 percentage points, is that something that is
at the moment relatively low in the context of future potential? Thank you.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Hi. Sorry for the delay. Nick, I was just checking the figures. In terms of -- good morning to
you. In terms of the generation that you see, it's been coming fundamentally from the
new business. So that was on the positive side of the capital variation the main driver in
this first half.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Right. So the actual capital release from the back book isn't[ph] particularly increasing. It
has reduced capital intensity of new business. Is that correct?

A - Philippe Donnet

{BIO 4657671 <GO>}

Can you can you ask your question once again, please?

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Sorry, I was just wondering what the driver of the life capital generation is, is it more -- I
mean that's been a release of capital ongoing obviously for the decades from the back
book. But I wondered whether that was accelerating now because I think you don't give
these numbers, do you at the moment? And I wondered whether it was acceleration of
release from the back book or whether it was a significant reduction in capital intensive
new business that was driving capital generation on the life side which of those two? Is
that an expense?

A - Philippe Donnet

{BIO 4657671 <GO>}

I think you may be talking about the development -- development of the solvency ratio
perhaps rather than capital generation. So let's say as on one hand outgoing business
which is maturing and that business is going out. If you look at the figures, especially for
the full year but also now you will see that the figure, the business is going out at a
comparatively higher SCR than the business that's coming in. So let's say that the -- if that
is the question you're asking, let's say sales financing ability of the new business is greater

Page 12 of 21



Company N ame: Assicuraz ioni Generali SpA
Company Ticker: G I M Equity
Date: 2018-08-01

than the one of the business that's going out. So there is a net positive contribution to
solvency from the new business that is being written.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah. Right. That is very helpful. And then, just following on --

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Your question to rather than capital generation you're asking us about the development
of the solvency ratio.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Yes, I think you are correct, the difference between cash and (inaudible).

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

That it for the moment we've seen we have a trend which will last for a while that where
let's say you have a marginal benefit from the greater capital efficiency of the new
business being written replacing the business going out. So I, it's kind of asymptotic in
terms of behavior that's going to be a day where this difference is not going to be large,
but for the moment it will last for a while.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Finally, are you worried that unit linked sales might fall off a bit, because they've been
amazingly strong, haven't they?

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Yes, the unit linked sales as a matter of fact are doing okay, if not very well. Two elements
for you to understand them. One was in Italy. The fact that I said before, other was a
renewal in the sales catalog that had some impact, which is just a timing issue. So nothing
to worry about. Remember also that Ireland the company we sold was a unit linked
producer. So it not only had smaller sales, but it also went out of scope. So that does have
an impact on the unit linked performance. Overall, actually we are quite happy, it's been a
good satisfactory second half -- second quarter. Second quarter was better than the first
quarter in terms of sales and we are holding up. We are holding up in a diversified way.
Unit linked continue to meet success and distribution. So overall we're happy with that.

FINAL

Q - Gianluca Ferrari

Hi, good morning. Three questions from me. Three weeks ago you published a press
release announcing the deal for Generali Leben, you mentioned an industrial partnership
with Viridium. Can you elaborate a bit on this partnership? Are you going to invest in
Viridium for example? Second question is on M&A. I think so far you mentioned P&C and
asset management as the preferred areas where you would like to invest. Could you tell
us is asset gathering in Italy, so financial advisers is included in your definition of asset
management? So it is an area where you might evaluate deals? Third question is if you
can breakdown the 2.3 billion inflows in Italy in life in Q1 and Q2 and if you can give us the
contribution of Allianz through the two quarters? Thank you.

A - Philippe Donnet

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 15042989 <GO>}

{BIO 4657671 <GO>}

Okay. On Generali Leben, yes, we will invest in Viridium, we said it. We said we would
invest in Viridium we are working on it. I think it's -- not only it's a good investment, but we
also want to be part of building this management platform -- this liabilities management
platform. We want to be part of this solution for the German market. Our initiative to sell
the Generali Leben is obviously an important one on the German market and we want to
be part of that. We also want to not only we -- as you know we retain 10.1% of Generali
Leben and we will continue sitting on the Board of Generali Leben, but also we will
probably have a stake in Viridium and it's also a way for for us to continue taking clear of
our customers -- of the customers of Generali Leben, But I think this is, this is important.
We always said that this transaction was a good one not certainly for our Group, both for
all stakeholders and we, feel responsible for the way our customers will be treated and
we will still be be part of this process.
So yes, we will enter a partnership with Viridium. On M&A, once again we are very
opportunistic. Definitely we long to further diversify our Group geographically in terms of
business lines, which means that we would be very interested in looking at good property
casualty opportunities as well as good asset management opportunities. Do we consider
asset gathering business in Italy as asset management, the answer is no. It's different.
Asset management is factory[ph] , asset gathering is a distribution business. So and to -to increase our exposure on the distribution business in Italy is not our top priority.

Q - Gianluca Ferrari

On the net (inaudible) Luigi?

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Good afternoon. The information is not in public disclosure. So I unfortunately cannot tell
you. I would say in terms of the quarter it's been -- as I said before in previous answers,
it's been a good quarter. We have -- as I said they were mainly the usual trend on the
Page 14 of 21

FINAL

savings side, and on unit linked, there was a minor impact from this renewal in the product
offering. In terms of Generali Italia versus Allianz they were good and broadly similar in
terms of contribution to the performance. So from -- as far as I can give you a qualitative
answer there wasn't anything to make Allianz stand out especially compared to Generali
Italia.

We can now take our next question Michael Huttner of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Thank you very much. And I had two questions, the first one is on the discontinued or the
operations which have been sold, if you could give us an annual figure for the no
more[ph] contribution into operating profit and maybe split it life and non-life that would
help easily? It made -- the comparison of results in the first half were very noisy. So that
was my first question. And on the second, I just wondered, if you can say a word on cash
flow, you've touched on all the other metrics, and they're fantastic and really well done.
You have done in terms maybe not at the speed of (inaudible) you have been very
impressive. On the cash flow you do have a target and that you've kind of also indicated
that the numbers would be growing because new business impacts subsequent years. It
doesn't come in early, but I wonder if you could give us a feel for how we're doing this
year compared with last? Thank you.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Okay. Hi, Michael. Good afternoon. So it's a very fair question, basically, you can see a gap,
which is kind of around 120 million between the figure that was released a year ago in the
first half and the figure that we stated the year and that reflects these operations. So you
have to bear in mind that -- in there, you have operations that were quite volatile. So
especially the Dutch, and German, were operations that are quite volatile in performance.
So as much as the guidance can be given to you the -- let's say there's not an even
underlying pattern in the past that can guide the comparison going forward.
With this in mind roughly, it's going to be the second -- the second half should be slightly
less than the first half in terms of the operating impact in the first so less than twice, which
would be the usual calculation. Slightly less than that.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

And on cash flow?

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Yes, in terms of cash flow, just for me to understand, I imagine you are referring to the 7
billion target. Is that what you are referring to? Is that the figure you're talking about?

Yes, that's right. And I think I don't have my paper in front of me but last year it was about
2.4 billion or something.

FINAL

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Right. So I would say two answers to that. As we we have said in the public disclosure, we
are looking forward to the satisfactory meeting of the targets that have been announced.
In a broader way, the cash generation and cash remittance to the holding company of the
Group is I would say one of the key areas of management focus. There has been
continuous -- and continuous to be efforts to improve generation in many ways of the
companies in order that we have higher margins, better underwriting, lower expenses. So
there is lot of initiatives, which allow the subsidiaries to generate more cash. And there
are clearly many initiatives in order to ensure that generally speaking remittance are larger
towards the holding company. So in terms of development there, clearly shouldn't be less
than in the past, going forward. That's what I can tell you at this point.

Next question comes from Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous. Please go ahead.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

I have three quick questions, i think. Philippe in your -- in the press release yesterday and
today again, you used the word challenges in respect to the next plan. I mean are you
referring to the anticipated level of ambition in that plan or maybe is the operating
environment, what do you see as the key challenges when you are thinking about using -use of that word for the next plan? Second question, quick one, what -- are there any
major hurdles for regulatory approval for the sale of Generali Leben and is there any
rough timetable or expected timetable on that? And the final one, I noticed, I think it was
in the life business, you sold some corporate bonds by government and implied that
you're looking to do some de-risking. What is the kind of current investment strategy?
Overseas markets have been a bit volatile, reinvestment rates haven't really moved
much. Are you actually looking to derisk and what will that be? Thanks.

A - Philippe Donnet

{BIO 4657671 <GO>}

Well, the first challenge as you -- as you mentioned will be the level of ambition of our
plan. This plan will be ambitious, definitely. We want it to be ambitious. Because, once
again I think we will have great opportunities to take -- to catch, because we are in a very
different -- a very different situation. Of course, I expect the environment to be
challenging. But I would say normally -- normally challenging in the past few years, the
Page 16 of 21

FINAL

environment has been challenging, we've been through many things. Now, I think that our
company is used to work in a very low interest rate environment. Since I was appointed
I've been through the referendum in Italy. The crisis of the Italian banks. The Brexit, the
election of Trump and so on. And more recently, there were some changes in the Italian
politics. So we are quite used and trained to cope with challenging environments. So
we're -- I still expect some volatility, I still expect some geopolitical uncertainty.
Having said that, if your question is more specific about Italy, my answer is very clear on
this. I'm not concerned about Italy. I'm not concerned, because, first of all, we will have a
clear view in September when the budget will be discussed. And then I know, Italy quite
well. I have been living here 10 -- and working 10 years in Italy now, and the basics of the
economy are strong and Italy is a great country with strongest situation. Then we will be
able to protect the basics of the economy because, in Italy, economies matters more than
politics. So I'm -- I don't think that Italian politics will be our main challenge in the next -- in
the next year. So if -- I would retain the level of ambition as our main challenge. So it's a
challenge that we decide ourselves and it's definitely a challenge that we will be happy to
win.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the second question, there is no time timetable -- no expected timetable. I mean, it's
an important transaction. The BaFin, the local regulator -- German regulator, BaFin, wants
to make sure that policy holders will be treated in a fair way, and I think that this is their job
and we will do our best to make to ensure that our policy holders would be treated the
right way. It will take they need and I just cannot anticipate what will be this time, but we
will -- we probably will provide them all the information, they are going to request. So I
expect this approval to be a normal and smooth one, but it will take some time.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Regarding your third question. Yes, indeed, it's part of the normal -- I mean just bear in
mind, when we indicate variations this cannot be massive on a portfolio of our scale, let's
say trend, which of course they are fundamentally motivated by relative value. So indeed,
there was let's say, comparatively lower weight on corporate bonds and comparative
weight on -- a larger weight on government bonds. But also remember that we have an
execution of the strategy of greater weight of real assets. So, part of our new money is
going into these assets. So that of course -- at the rates and proportions that you can
expect on our portfolio. But you will see a marginal decrease of other investment
components and a marginal increase of the real assets.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

You're talking real estate equities, infrastructure that kind of assets?

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Thanks very much and three questions please. You mentioned in your transport[ph]
comments that Italy motor is still softening and you're pulling back here, obviously. Is there
any turnaround you expect later this year or next year or whether you're still going to be
pulling back out of this market? And secondly, you say that you have nearly completed the
geographical optimization. So, can I ask what is left to do and how many more businesses
might be under review for the potential disposal? And then lastly on Mediobanca's
comments this morning about them a stake sale in -- by June 2019. Have they been in
contact with you about this and do you know any more details? Thank you.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi, Steven. So in terms of of Italian motor, let's say that the situation is kind of stable
where it is, perhaps some marginal improvements, but yet to say whether it is going to be
a strong continuation in the first half. So let's say, I would say relative stability on the sales
outlook. Geographical optimization is -- Philippe is going to take a look at it.

A - Philippe Donnet

{BIO 4657671 <GO>}

We completed the geographical optimization, I would say at 99%. There are very smaller
assets remaining on the lease. But let's say it's completed. So nothing significant to be
announced. On Mediobanca owns 13% of Generali. They are the first shareholder of
Generali. They sit in the Board of Directors. So I have I would say a normal relationship with
our main shareholders. I am not discussing their strategy with them -- I mean the disposal,
the potential disposal of 3% of Generali by Mediobanca is part of Mediobanca's strategy.
I'm not discussing this strategy with them. I'm discussing our strategy with our Board of
Directors.

these were? And finally regarding the sale of Generali Leben, can you give us some more
detail what will be the impact on the SCR at the moment? The SCR is heavily overweight
on market and credit risks. How much will that decline following the closing of that
transaction? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Okay. The -- excuse me, I'm sorry. As of in terms of protection business we saw some
decrease in France in this quarter. In Germany, there can be a marginal impact that is
coming from Leben that is selling as you can imagine much less business, almost nothing
this year. So that is having an impact. In Germany, regarding assumptions, there are
changes that are not so significant. The mix perhaps has had greater impact overall on the
profitability. And there are no more -- there is no more information on the SCR with
regard to what we already said in the disclosure when we announced the deal. It is
roughly -- Generali Leben represents roughly 1 billion of SCR.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Johnny Vo

{BIO 5509843 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you very much. A lot of my questions have been asked, but just a couple of
more questions. Just in regards to Generali Leben, is there any risk here that if BaFin looks
at various things that there could be some risk on the -- any of the disposal proceeds?
And is there a risk that some of the proceeds will have to stay in the German unit? That's
the first question. And just on Page 45, I guess, it shows the debt schedule -- on Slide 45,
given the disposal proceeds and the likely proceeds will probably be received for Leben
maybe in 2019. Can you talk about whether some of the debt will be refinanced or some
of the proceeds will be used to pay down the debt as you've done with the 250 million
coming up? Thank you.

A - Philippe Donnet

{BIO 4657671 <GO>}

Well, good, it's very likely that BaFin will ask many question, I don't think they're going to
raise issues, but they're are going to ask questions. Once again they want to make sure
that the way Viridium is going to treat policy holders will not put policy holders at risk. We
are going to help them to provide all the information. Having said that, it's a regulatory
approval process. We are not in control of it. I'm expecting more questions than issues,
but we will -- we will see. You know this is a long story. The disposal of Generali Leben is
something that happens now but that we started preparing two years ago. So we've
been working on every step -- every single step. We had to find the distribution solution
for the agents. We have to decide to put Generali Leben in the run-off. The decision had
to be made by the Supervisory Board of Generali in Germany. As you know the Generali
Supervisory Board in Germany includes the representatives of the employees.

So it's a very long and very complex process, and all stakeholders have already been
involved in this process since the very beginning. So, I think that now the deal is on the
table of BaFin, but they know everything about it. We will provide all the additional
requested information, but it's a very mature process. Having said that, BaFin can always
raise issues and ask questions. On the debt you want to -- we are going to use our cash
to yes, pay back the first call -- the call we have this year of 250 million of hybrid bonds.
Yes we're going to use our cash, whether it's coming from the proceeds of the disposals
