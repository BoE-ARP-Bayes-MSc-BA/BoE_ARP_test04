As usual, if we go to page three of the presentation, you can see that we had a very good
start into 2021. When we look at the revenue, the revenue are ﬂat. This is mostly explained
by Property-Casualty and Life/Health. In Asset Management, we see a nice development.
On the operating proﬁt, we have an operating proﬁt of EUR3.3 billion, which is clearly
above the prior period, but that was fairly easy. The point is that EUR3.3 billion is also
above the run rate of our outlook of EUR12 billion for the full year. And also what is a good
part of the story, all segments have contributed to these results. When we look at the
combined ratio in P&C, we are at our target level of 93%. When we look at the new
business margin in Life, we are basically also at our target level of about 3%. And then the
cost-income ratio in property -- in Asset Management is below 60% and you see also that
we had very nice inﬂows that we are going to see in a second. This is not just PIMCO, it's
also AGI. The net income is EUR2.6 billion. Clearly, the net income is beneﬁting from the
strong operating performance, but also there was basically no impairment in the course
of the ﬁrst quarter. So, overall, a good start into the year, which is also clearly encouraging
as we think about the remainder of 2021.

And with that, I will go to page ﬁve. The solvency ratio has improved by 3 percentage
points. If you adjust for the core or the RT1, in reality, the improvement on a pro forma
basis is more like 7 percentage point. And the sensitivity as you might see on the right
hand side are -- basically the sensitivity downwards are basically very close to what we
had at the beginning of the year. So, strong capitalization sensitivities, which are broadly
unchanged.
When we go to page seven, you can see the driver, the development of the Solvency II
ratio. And I would say what is deﬁnitely positive is the development of the organic
generation, it's plus 9%. This number is before dividend, before taxes. If you adjust for
dividend and taxes, you have -- we have an improvement of 4 percentage point. The
market has been also favorable, especially the interest rates went up. So, this leads to an
improvement pretax of 8 percentage point. And then on the capital
management/management action, we have especially the impact coming from the
accrual or the dividend and also we had impact coming from having called the RT1. So,
again, 210% is a good level of solvency ratio. And I would say also the fact that one driver
of the improvement was the strong organic capital generation, it's deﬁnitely positive.
And now we go to page nine, that's about our Property-Casualty segment, and that's
about the growth rates. Overall, the growth rate adjusted for consolidation and FX was
minus 1.6%. If we also remove for second Allianz partners from the equation reality, the
growth rate is minus 0.5%. So, very, very close to the ﬂat growth rate. Clearly, this is not a
growth rate that we would like to see, but here we are. Deﬁnitely, the impact coming from
also the COVID situation. And on top of that, we are taking also measure to -- in our
commercial lines business in order to increase the proﬁtability. And we are very conﬁdent
that as we go out of the COVID situation, we're going to see again our normal growth
rates in Property-Casualty. The rate momentum is overall stable. There is an just an
exception, which is Italy, but that's also the country where we had a very strong situation
from a proﬁtability point of view. So, we have deﬁnitely a good starting point there. And
then just one comment on AGCS, the rate increases are still very, very strong. So, when we
say stable, we mean that we see stable rate increases. They might be slightly below what

we saw last year, but we are still speaking of double-digit rate increases in the industrial
business.
So, if we now move to page 11. The operating proﬁt is clearly much better compared to
the one of last year. So, overall, we have an improvement of EUR500 million. The driver
improvement is the combined ratio. And I would say that accident year loss ratio has
improved by about 6 percentage point. Thereof, 2.5 percentage point of improvement is
coming from COVID, 2 percentage point plus is coming from the better development of
the natural catastrophe and a good 1 percentage point of improvement is coming from
underlying performance. The main driver of this improvement is indeed the development
at AGCS. When we look at the expense ratio, it's also improved. So, the -- so, again, a
quarter where we are showing an improvement compared to the expense ratio in the
prior period. And then the run-oﬀ results, it's lower compared to the last year. Here, I can
tell you that we are just taking conservative stance. I think our results, as you see, how
good they are, are at the level, the target we gave ourselves and we can also, say, take a
conservative stand on our results. So, the quality of 93% combined ratio is, in my opinion,
very, very good.
Moving now to page 13, we have the exhibit by OEs. And you can see a lot of our
subsidiaries have good combined ratio. So, Germany with 91% or United Kingdom is even
below 90%, the same applies to Eastern Europe, Italy, Spain. In Australia, we have a
combined ratio, which is higher than our expectation and that's because of the natural
catastrophe in Australia, especially I think in the month of January. Otherwise, you can see
that AGCS has a combined ratio of 98%. This is in line with the expectation that we set at
the beginning of the year. And here, I can also tell you there is a COVID impact negative
of about 3 percentage points. So, in reality if you adjust for that, one could say that the
underlying performance is already better than the 98% that you see on this page. And
then Euler Hermes with a combined ratio below 80%, it's clear -- is a clear indication that
at the moment there is no pressure on claims and we have been also fairly conservative in
the choice of the loss peak.
And with that, let's move to page 15. The investment result is -- for P&C is up 3%. And here
what we see is that we got indeed a lot of support coming from the equity. We got
dividends. There was not a drop in dividend like we might have seen a little bit in the
prior year. And also, we got some additional proﬁt from our equity participation on the
other side, and this was expected. We see that the current yield is going down, but this
was already considered if you want in our thinking about the outlook. In reality, I would
say that what we see right now is that we are running a little bit better compared to what
we had anticipated in our outlook of EUR5.6 billion for the operating proﬁt of PropertyCasualty. So, this might be an area, where we're going to have a little bit of an uplift
compared to what we told you a few months ago.
Now we can move to page 17 on the Life side. Overall, you see that the production is up
about 8%. So, overall, remember that we're always concerned about what could happen
to production as we do all the product changes. And I would say that the production is
already pretty nicely. We see also very nice development in Italy. We see a nice
development in Asia. And USA, if you adjust for the FX, we see a growth rate of 8%. On
the same time, the new business margin is going up by -- to be very speciﬁc by 10 basis

point, although it looks like 20. And the improvement is coming from professionals. And
that's because of actions we have taken, especially in France to improve the proﬁtability of
that business. But in my opinion what is very telling is the fact that in the capital-eﬃcient
products, although the environment is very diﬀerent compared to what we had last year,
the drop in new business margin is only 20 basis points and the actions we are taking,
they are going clearly to have an eﬀect in the course of the year. Indeed, also, as you
know, we are calculating this new business margin based on the beginning of the period
interest rate with exception for the US, but for the rest of the business we do that. So, as of
now, even doing that, we are already above the 3% level. So, overall, good level of
production, also new business margin which are going up and holding very nicely.

Bloomberg Transcript

And with that, page 19, we speak about the in-force portfolio performance. Overall, nice
increase compared to the prior year period. That was also easy, if you want, because in
2020 we had a lot of negative impact due to the volatility, but we have also to recognize
that EUR1.2 billion is above the EUR1.1 billion of run rate operating proﬁt and also it is nice
to see all segments, if you want, all lines of business are contributing to this improvement.
Clearly, the development in the USA has played a major role in getting to this kind of
result increase. But I tell you we see also a nice development in Asia and also Italy, and
the unit-linked business is also doing pretty, pretty nicely.
So, with that, page 21. We show the new business margin and operating proﬁt by entity.
Overall, I would say the new business margin is holding pretty nicely, and I will say in the
USA you can see that we had a substantial increase compared to last year. In Asia Paciﬁc,
we see the new business margin of 6%. And also I would highlight in Central and Eastern
Europe, although the margin is a little bit down, it's still at a good level of 4%. So, the only
area where we need to put some additional work is France, but also there you see at least
that we were able to improve compared to last year. And the operating proﬁt, again, you
see a nice recovery compared to last year. And I think now we are -- we have a sort of
competition between Germany Life and USA. For the quarter, we have the exact same
number of operating proﬁt, so we're going to see who is going to do better in Q2. And
clearly since I was in the USA, I'm always a little bit a fan of Allianz Life.
And with that, let's move to page 23 on the investment margin. We have an investment
margin of the more than EUR1 billion. And when you look at the investment margin in
relation to the policy reserve, it's about 21 basis points, which is higher compared to our
expectation. If you annualize that of 70 to 75 basis points, I would say the following.
Clearly, in this quarter, we didn't see any impairment. Basically, there were really no
impairments, so this has supported also the net harvesting. And this leads also to this
level of investment margin. As we've seen throughout the year, clearly we don't expect to
have this 20 basis point recurring, unless the situation remains like that. But I think most
likely, we're going to end up anyway at least at the upper end of the range of the 70 to 75
basis point that we provided you at the end of this year. So, overall, a good result. I would
like also to highlight anyway that our Life proﬁt are not just a function of the investment
margin and, indeed, we get about 66% of our revenue, two-third of our revenue from
loadings and technical margin. So, that's also something which is important to keep in
mind.

And with that, page 25. On the Asset Management segment, I can say results are really
good. We have achieved a level of EUR2.4 trillion of assets under management. That's the
highest record -- highest level for Allianz. And also what you see both AGI and PIMCO
contributing to this development. And when you look at the asset classes, you can see
growth in all asset classes. When you look at the regions, you can see growth in all
regions. I'd like also to highlight that in Asia Paciﬁc, we have more than EUR200 billion of
assets under management, so it's not just Europe and America where clearly we are very
large, but we have also sizable now presence in Asia Paciﬁc.
So, if you go to page 27 on the development of the third-party assets under management,
you can see that the ﬂows in the quarter had been strong with about EUR40 billion of
ﬂows. Thereof, EUR12 billion coming from AGI, that's the highest level for AGI. And if you
remember, we saw also a nice trajectory at the end of 2020. In the case of PIMCO, we
have been used to see this EUR20 billion plus now for a few quarters. And when you look
then at the composition of these ﬂows by asset classes and regions, you can see that
overall there was a pickup in ﬂows across the board. Then, as usual, we had the impact
coming from market development from FX. And when you combine the two, you see that
at least for the quarter the impact coming from these economic drivers was positive. So,
we are starting with an asset base of about EUR1.8 billion of assets under management, so
that's a good starting point as we think about also the second quarter and the remainder
of the year.
Page 29, the revenue are up about 9% and we see a very nice growth in the revenue at
AGI. If you adjust for FX eﬀects, it's about 15%. PIMCO is a little bit lower, 6%, but PIMCO,
we had also a special eﬀect which is having impact also on the fee margin. We launched a
closing fund in the ﬁrst quarter. And when you launch these kind of closing funds, you
have underwriting fees and you cannot defer the underwriting fees. So, if we adjust for
that eﬀect, fee margin will be a couple of basis point higher. And also I think the impact of
that underwriting fees on our revenue compared to the prior period was about 5
percentage points. So, once you start adjusting the numbers of PIMCO for this eﬀect, you
get to a diﬀerent picture. And clearly, that's a good thing, the launch of this closed-end
fund because we're going to get revenue and proﬁt moving forward.
At page 31, the operating proﬁt of the Asset Management segment is up double-digit,
10%. If you adjust for the FX eﬀect, it's up 16%. PIMCO is ﬂat, but that's a consequence of
the FX impacts. And in the case of AGI, we have a very nice development of the operating
proﬁt with about EUR200 million of results. And clearly here you see the impact of
growing revenue on a double-digit level and the expenses are down about 7%. You
remember, we did a restructuring last year, so now we see the beneﬁt of this
restructuring. And the cost/income ratio is 61%, it's the lowest cost/income ratio we have
seen at AGI.
Corporate, page 33, is improved compared to last year. Here, we have always some
volatility. We had some FX eﬀect changes, so they were slightly negative last year, they are
slightly positive this year. We have an improvement in the operating proﬁt of our Allianz
technology and also there is some seasonality in the expense line item. You might also
remember that last year, we had here the impacts of the solidarity charge for COVID in

Page 5 of 21

FINAL

France. Overall, I would say, we are a little bit better than our expectation, but there is also
some just seasonality in the numbers.
And at page 35, net income is signiﬁcantly up compared to last year, EUR2.6 billion.
Clearly, we are beneﬁting from the strong operating performance. And then as you see,
the impairments are basically very close to zero, so there were no impairment during the
course of Q1. And the tax rate is 23%, it's a little bit higher than last year, but somehow
lower than our normal tax rate. That's because of the one-oﬀ positive impact. But all-in-all,
I would say strong operating performance combined with the benign capital markets
have contributed to these very strong results in our net income.
So, in conclusion, page 37, I would say very strong quarter. It's not just about the EUR3.3
billion of operating proﬁt or the EUR2.6 billion net income, it's also about the underlying
93% combined ratio in Property-Casualty, with quality, a decrease or the expense ratio in
Asset Management. Life, you see that our new business margin, as we speak, is already
3% and we're getting premium. And you can also see the operating proﬁt is very, very
stable. And in Asset Management, we have a record level of asset management ﬂows. We
have also, I will say, very strong cost/income ratio at AGI. We are starting with an asset
base, which is a very good starting point as we think about the remainder of the year. So,
there is a lot of strength in the underlying of the business and that's across the segments.
On top of that is Solvency ratio II, 210%, it's very far away from 180%. So, we feel pretty
good about the start of the year and also about how we are positioned to go into the
remainder of the year.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Okay. (Operator Instructions) We'll go ahead and take our ﬁrst question from Peter Eliot
with Kepler Cheuvreux. Peter, please go ahead.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Good afternoon all and great results. I have three questions,
please. Firstly on that cost/income ratio of AGI that you just mentioned, Giulio. Could you
say how sustainable that is? And obviously a very good ﬁgure, I'm just wondering if -- I
mean, probably too good to hope for that that can continue, but I'd be grateful for your
comments. Secondly on PIMCO, it looks to me like you've been making a higher margin
on internal assets for the last couple of quarters, just backing out the third-party funds.
Just is that right, is there anything that sort of happened on the pricing structure or -yeah, are you able to comment there? And thirdly on Euler Hermes. I mean, I guess, given
that half the business presumably is still at sort of 100% combined ratio, the other half is
really very, very low indeed. And I'm just wondering about your thoughts for the outlook
there. I mean, should we expect the same pattern in Q2? What about as the economies
sort of open up? And -- yeah -- I mean, I guess, when you think about the sort of state
scheme now, I mean, with hindsight, obviously, that was a bad deal for you because
Page 6 of 21



Company Name: Allianz SE
Company Ticker: ALV GR Equity
Date: 2021-05-12

you've given away a lot of proﬁt. I'm just wondering, what the sort of outlook or
discussions are on that? Anything you can add would be very helpful. Thank you very
much.

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Okay. Yeah. Thank you, Peter. So, starting from AGI cost/income ratio. I would now
assume that we're going to be at 61% cost/income ratio as a new normal. But deﬁnitely, if
you remember, the idea was we want to be at 67% cost/income ratio. And I think this
target is very easily achievable. As we go through the remainder of the year and also as
we think about the future, we need to consider also how much we want to invest in the
business. So, I think we're starting from a very good point. And so, now, I will say that we
are deﬁnitely in control of our cost/income ratio, so that's a good place to be. So, I would
expect that clearly we're going to set us a goal, which is better than the 67% cost/income
ratio and the conversation is going to be more about how much we want to invest in the
business. But I think the progress at AGI has been really phenomenal. And I would say the
statutory spaces initiative that we did last year are clearly paying oﬀ. You can see this in
this number. There is -- that's important also. In this number 61%, there is no one-oﬀ,
nothing. So, it's a pure number. So, from that point of view, one could also argue, okay,
that's the starting point. But, again, I think we always need to consider about how much
we want also to invest in the business, but again very good situation to have.
On the question about PIMCO and the internal assets, no, we didn't change anything. So,
from that point of view, I don't know, so how you derive your numbers, but there is
nothing really going on from the point of view of the proﬁtability that PIMCO is getting
out of the management of the Allianz France. The only case might be is ARE, Allianz Real
Estate. Because as you know last year, we put Allianz Real Estate into PIMCO. So, you
might see an increase clearly of fees due to that and also some increase in proﬁt. But
fundamentally, there is no change, otherwise, in the charges that PIMCO is taking on the
managing -- on the management of the ﬁxed income portfolio.
Then Euler Hermes, on your question about the expectation for the combined ratio. And I
would say that the -- in reality, the combined ratio, the underlying combined ratio is even
better compared to the one that we have showed in the slides because we are not seeing
necessarily claims activity at this point in time. I believe we are going to be in this situation
deﬁnitely also as we go into the remainder of 2021. And I would expect even to see
stability in 2022. And then maybe by 2023, 2024, we might see a little bit of a diﬀerent
dynamic regarding solvency. The point regard with Euler Hermes is we are not like a bank,
right, we're not extending credit for 20 years, so we can always adjust our exposure
basically on a daily basis. So, deﬁnitely, the situation looks very good, very strong. With
hindsight, I would be a billionaire. So, from that point of view, I would say at that time, the
decision in my opinion was the right decision. We deﬁnitely gave some proﬁt away, but
think about how people were feeling one year ago, right. So, there is no regret or no
complaints here. And we are -- actually if you ask me, we are happy anyway that we are
having this kind of conversation now instead of being happy that maybe we are ceding
some losses to the state, I think we are in a better situation this way.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 21454754 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi. Fantastic. Thank you so much. Yeah. I think I'd just repeat as you said these amazing
numbers. I think a three-point question. One, which is what's the previous -- your kind of
competitor who just reported kind of said, the -- I think they've made it -- they didn't say
quite like that. But that -- I think they said, they kind of implied they've never seen it so
good. So, in other words, taxes fees for them was paid fully by rate rises. Is that the feeling
you have for the business as a whole? And here, my speciﬁc question, because this
sounds very, very vague, is why didn't you see -- if you're so conﬁdent, why didn't you
change guidance? EUR11 billion to EUR13 billion is so big, it's like -- and then the second
question also on guidance. So, you have raised it in operating proﬁt from a range of EUR7
million to EUR8 million to now, I think, EUR10 million or maybe even over EUR10 million, I
don't know. And I just wondered, what the moving parts are to this? And then my ﬁnal
question would be a really simple one. Your competitors are looking at back book deals.
Is that something you were thinking about as well in Life? Thank you.

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Yeah. I think I got two out of the three question, maybe ﬁrst I answer the two and then ask
you -- maybe I tell you what and then --

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 21454754 <GO>}

(Multiple Speakers)

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

-- and then we -- okay. So, on the ﬁrst one about changing the guidance, it's almost
philosophical that we're not going to change the guidance in Q1, it's after three months.
But clearly when you look at the underlying performance, we are doing ﬁne. And to a
certain degree, clearly we expect also this underlying performance to stay. So, I wouldn't
take the EUR3.3 billion times 4, but I could also tell you that, yeah, most likely the EUR3
billion per quarter, we are going to be able to exceed that. But in the ﬁrst quarter, we are
not going to change guidance. It's -- I would say, it's really a matter of principle, almost
philosophical. In the second quarter, we see where we are and that's the time when
clearly we might consider to change guidance. So, there is no -- let's say nothing to read
behind the fact that we are keeping this EUR12 billion plus/minus EUR1 billion, it's just a
philosophical position if you ask me.

On the back book, because I didn't get necessarily the second question, yes, we also look
at back book.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 21454754 <GO>}

FINAL

(Multiple Speakers)

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Yeah. The back book is -- okay. The back book, yeah, you also just said there was very -it's very small transaction, but basically we closed the back book transaction in Benelux.
We are looking at other back books in Europe. We might consider also back books in the
United States, where it's a little bit even easier to get things done pretty quickly. So, we
are deﬁnitely also looking into this kind of a tool in order to make sure that the capital
allocation can be optimal capital allocation from a return to the shareholders. So, we are
deﬁnitely working on this dimension too. It can take time. As I said, it's -- you need a lot of
education, sometimes you need to educate regulator -- regulators because they are not
used to it. And sometimes policyholder consideration that you need to be aware of, there
can be tax consideration that you need to be aware of. That's the reason why it can take
time. We concluded a transaction about our Spanish back book that was about EUR1
billion last year, it took us basically over two years to get from basically where we had the
clear plan of what we wanted to do to get the ﬁnal approval. So, two years from once we
are ready to move to getting the ﬁnal approval. But I believe that you're going to see
some activities in the next quarters from our side.

{BIO 21454754 <GO>}

On buybacks?

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

(Multiple Speakers) Buybacks, at the moment is still where -- here at least in Germany, we
are a little bit behind with our corona situation. So, we still have some lockdowns. I believe
that after the summer break, the situation is going to be back to normal also here. At that
time, I believe that also from a regulatory point of view the sentiment is going to be
diﬀerent. And as we clearly go into the second part of the year, we are going to
potentially consider buyback. I would say on the buyback, I would say -- and that's more a
general statement is our -- deﬁnitely our intention over time to -- and that's what we did in
the past, to have a very disciplined approach where we do buyback and also we can take
the opportunity to do M&A. So, we are -- that's the philosophy that we are going to use,
and that's the way we want to run the company moving forward. Now, clearly, you cannot
do this on a quarterly basis, on a yearly basis, half and half, right. So, there can be
situation where you might see more M&A coming through and then you might owe
Page 9 of 21

buyback and the other way around. But on a rolling basis, I can tell you that the
philosophy that we are going to have is to have this healthy combination between M&A
activity and buybacks.

Thank you. Good afternoon, good morning, everybody. So, two questions from me. So,
on the premium growth in P&C, Giulio, so down 1.6% in Q1. The annual report recently
you published, it was published in March and you have 2021 targets in those numbers
and those targets will go up with -- we're talking about COVID and the impacts of COVID,
but expecting P&C premium to rebound pretty strongly, 5% to 6% is the number that
we've targeted for 2021. What happened in the phase of two to three months with -- we're
missing by that amount? That's my ﬁrst question.
Secondly on P&C operating proﬁt, you've got the guidance for EUR5.6 billion plus or
minus 10% in 2021. But the three-year plan is actually calling for a number actually
growing at a 5% CAGR. So, we're looking at more like over EUR6.3 billion from that threeyear plan. I appreciate interest rates are lower, so there's some real pressure and clearly
the volumes are actually low as well. But can you just help me understand the delta versus
that EUR6.3 billion, even if we are coming in at the top end as you said earlier? Thank you.

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

We cannot understand you properly, the line is very broken. So, we got the ﬁrst question,
but the second one, I couldn't get you. The line is very --

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

(Multiple Speakers) I'll just touch on that quickly. Sure. So, the 2021 proﬁt target that you
have for P&C is EUR5.6 billion plus or minus 10%, but in the three-year plan that was given
in 2018 that called for 5% CAGR getting to at least EUR6.3 billion in 2021. Appreciate that
EUR5.6 billion you're now saying it can be top end of that, so maybe closer to EUR6
billion, but I'm just keen to understand what the diﬀerence is between the three-year plan
and where you're guiding to at the moment. I presume it's sort of volume growth and
some of the investment in your pressure, but if you could just help me understand some
of those moving pieces. Thank you.

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Yeah. Perfect. So, coming on the -- the ﬁrst question was about the premium and premium
growth. Okay. I know in the annual report, there was the statement about growth in P&C.
This came a little bit from our economic reserves. We've been always very clear in our
conversation that our expectation, especially for the beginning of 2021, was to have a ﬂat
revenue growth, what we saw. So, I think the statement was a little bit more forwardlooking, but our expectation have always been that in reality in 2021 the growth is going
to be muted. And that's also the way we have been talking in our meetings.
With regards to the Property-Casualty operating proﬁt, yes, the point is clearly the
investment income is diﬀerent compared to what we might have assumed at that time. If
you look at the combined ratio, it's 93%, it's the same. So, from that point of view, the 93%
has not changed. Then there is clearly the fact that rates went down compared to what we
had in 2018. Also, consider that I said before, we might have been conservative in the
estimates of our investment income for 2021. So, we might see an uplift compared to the
EUR5.6 billion that we gave you. And then also the revenue growth in general is a little bit
lower. I think also that just because of partners and Euler Hermes, we are basically losing
EUR200 million, EUR250 million of operating proﬁt. So, if you start just adjusting for that,
which is probably -- which is going to come back once we get to the normal revenue
basis, if you also adjust for the investment income, then you see that in reality the
numbers are the one we said. And think about the fact that the combined ratio of 93% is
what we are planning to hit and we feel very comfortable about that. The expense ratio is
better compared to what we said at the time, so it's driven partially by Euler Hermes and
partners. And partially, it's also -- clearly, there is a little bit less investment income
compared to the assumption of 2018.

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Thank you, Giulio. The second part is clear, but the premium growth one, I just -- the
annual report, which was published only a couple of months ago is talking about 5% or
6% revenue growth in P&C premium. And now, we're kind of looking at minus 1.6% on a
gross written basis. So, just my question is more about what's happened to that expected
growth --?

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Nothing happened to that. I think the 5% to 6% of premium indicated there was sort of
think on a normalized basis as we go. I think it was about what a total market can do, but
that's not the number that we have really considered in our thinking. That's also not the
number that we've been using in the conversation that we had. We always have
highlighted that we expect premium P&C to be ﬂat, so I will not take that as the number
that we have been discussing in our conversation.

Q - James Shuck

Vinit, please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Vinit Malhotra

Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you very much. Just if I can ask one more on AGCS. I mean -so, obviously, some very good numbers in this quarter already. I mean, I was I think
surprised because I was thinking 98% would be somewhere towards later part of the year,
but you already got 98%. Is there some hope that AGCS can even do more? And because
the pricing, 22%, is rated somewhere will obviously come in, will be earned through the
year. And I just wanted to understand how you think about AGCS. If I can ask about
PIMCO. So, obviously, very strong net growth, but the perception in the market, how
should we -- or how do you propose to that change and challenge that perception that,
hey, when the US treasury yield goes up, there will be a deluge of outﬂows of -- at
PIMCO? I mean, that's why -- is there some more data you can provide to the market to
say, hey, this is the kind of revenue per strategy or -- obviously, there is evidence of
inﬂows coming in, but I was just wondering if you could comment on that? And lastly, if I
may ask, there has been some -- if I could just ask for an update on the M&A strategy,
please, given there's been an asset in the US where there's a lot of chat about yourself as
well. Could you just comment -- what kind of -- I mean, is there a change or should we just
continue to believe that the old bolt-on approach was what Allianz was most comfortable
in? Thank you.

A - Giulio Terzariol

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you, Vinit. On AGCS, I will say that, yes, we should over time see an
improvement. As I was also saying before, the 98% includes 3 percentage point of COVID
impact. And also if you look at the natural catastrophe, they were not excessively high for
AGCS, but they were also not low. So, I would say, there was no beneﬁt, let's put this way
for natural catastrophe that in the sense that we had a low loss from that. So, I would say
the 98% is a number that if you look at the underlying, it's even better. We see rate
increases. So, from that point of view, yes, the expectations that we're going to see over
time better performance at AGCS. Indeed, I was also discussing the situation with them
the other day. And we are at a point where we also believe that on a selective basis,
clearly, with a lot of discipline, we can also start thinking about growth again. We wanted
to be very sure that the underlying performance is strong. We did the analytics clearly at
the beginning of the year as we had all the information collected by year-end and we got
good response that we are on a good track. So, from that point of view, I will say that the
98% is not the end of the story, but that should be the beginning of a diﬀerent chapter for
AGCS. And the market is also helping, let's be serious. There is a lot of good stuﬀ that we
did and the market is deﬁnitely also supporting this direction.
On PIMCO and the net ﬂows, on the yield and treasury rates going up, I would always say
that, yes, clearly, if you have rates going up, ﬁrst, you might see investors going on the
sideline because, clearly, they are not going to invest in a ﬁxed income if there is
expectation that rates are going up. I would also diﬀerentiate there are a lot of investors
that are just investing in ﬁxed income, no matter what, but you might have the, call it,
smart money might clearly wait, but then you get the ﬂows six months later because then

FINAL

their money eventually is going to ﬂow. So, I would always separate what can be the
volatility that you might see in a quarter, two quarters. So, three quarters compared to
what you have to expect on long-term. And I would even say that higher rates would not
be a negative for PIMCO, I will say they will be on a present value basis, rather a positive.
So, from that point of view, I would say that it's something that can be manageable.
Also, I will say, think about how diversiﬁed we are. So, at the end of the day, when you
look at the diversiﬁcation that we have, also by strategy, I think there is a lot of resilience.
And I'm also sure that PIMCO will be capable to come up with some strategy also to
manage maybe the situation in the short-term. So, yes, there will be deﬁnitely an impact. If
rates go up, it might be more signiﬁcant or less signiﬁcant, but I will not be concerned
about the fact that the franchise of PIMCO is going to be very strong. In reality, we're
going to beneﬁt out of that. So, I'm not concerned about rates going up. I might have
maybe to explain to you this quarter ﬂows were negative. And then two quarter later, I'm
going to explain to you why the net ﬂows were so great and everything is going to be
ﬁne.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the question whether we can give you a revenue or margin by strategy, the answer is
no. We cannot do that, but you can imagine. Right? If it's a commodity ﬁxed income, it's
going to be lower fees. If it's some alternative asset, it's going to be higher fees, i.e., I
think that if you do some normal market research, you're going to ﬁnd out that what could
be the revenue strength by asset classes. I can tell you that due to the quality of our
franchise, usually, we can get fees which are at least at the market level, let's put this way.
But I cannot give you numbers, internal numbers by revenue, but there is no major secret.
And then on M&A strategy, no, there is no change compared to what we had done so far.
And also, if you look basically at the latest transaction, they are no diﬀerent. They might
be a little bit larger in size because clearly the Aviva Poland transaction was larger. But
from a philosophy point of view, it's clearly trying to strengthen our franchise in countries
where we tend to have a presence where we can create some synergies. So, there is no
change to the M&A strategy. And as I was saying before, there is also no change to this
idea that we want to combine buyback and M&A. As I was saying before, we can now do
this on a quarterly or yearly basis. But on a rolling basis, deﬁnitely, you're going to see this
balance coming through.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

And just if I can follow-up please. On COVID, there seems to be, I'd say, very low impact in
1Q. If -- I mean, do you have an outlook update for 2021 and if it is going to aﬀect your '21
target?

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

So, on COVID, I can tell you the impact in Q1 was indeed neutral. So, we had some -- we
still had some business interruption losses also as I was saying before, there was an
impact of about 3 percentage point at AGCS. But on the other side, we have the
frequency motor, which is lower. So, as I look to the remainder of the year, I will say that I
would not expect an impact from -- a negative impact from COVID. We might see in some
legislation still some development on business interruption. On the other side, we also
Page 13 of 21



FINAL

Company Name: Allianz SE
Company Ticker: ALV GR Equity
Date: 2021-05-12

know that the frequency in motor is going eventually to normalize, but as of how, it's still
lower than normal. So, I would say that COVID situation is not going to have an impact on
our numbers. I would also expect that as travel is coming back that we're going to see a
lift in revenue and proﬁtability at Allianz Partners. And also we are going out of the state
scheme in July here in Germany, so you -- we should also see some more proﬁt coming
from credit insurance. So, overall, I will say that COVID should be neutral and, in reality, I
think we might still take the opportunity to even add to the quality of our balance sheet as
we are doing right now.

Please go ahead.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi everybody. Good afternoon. On reserve releases, when do you think the conservatism
and visibility on some of the IBNR clears up and then you move back to the more normal
range? That's question one. Question two, you painted obviously a very bullish picture for
AGCS, but on the reverse side there, did you think there's potential risk of liability claims
inﬂation coming back as the economy opens? And then lastly on illiquids, are you still at
close to the sort of 21% level or do you think now, particularly as we go into new IFRS, do
you think now there's an opportunity to even further increase exposure to illiquids? Thank
you.

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Okay. So, the ﬁrst question on the run-oﬀ, I would say that we might change approach as
we go into 2022. And for this year, I think we are going more or less to follow this
approach. So, next year, 2022, '23, '24. You are raising by the way a question of inﬂation.
We're not concerned, honestly speaking, about a big spike in inﬂation or we might see
some inﬂation happening here and there. General inﬂation is not necessarily the claims
inﬂation, but this is something anyway that we -- at least we need to consider. So, having a
stronger reserve base is might be anyway also a solution in the case -- or an oﬀset in the
case indeed, inﬂation is backing up and is impacting the claims inﬂation. So, for the time
being, we are doing analysis deﬁnitely, but we are not seeing, I'll tell you, right now that
there is an increase in claims inﬂation or at least, let me say, we don't see this across the
board. You might see in some speciﬁc country, but we don't see a trend now generalized
about an increase in claims inﬂation.
And now on the illiquids investment and IFRS 17, I don't think necessarily that IFRS 17 is
going to have an impact on the amount of illiquid that we are holding because, at least on
Page 14 of 21



Company Name: Allianz SE

Date: 2021-05-12

FINAL

the debt side, okay, we need to consider what the classiﬁcation might be. So, if we end up
having a classiﬁcation of some illiquid that we need to use fair value, we might reconsider
the exposure to those illiquids. But I would assume that there are plenty of opportunities
to ﬁnd illiquid, which are going to be treated from an accounting point of view the same
way that we are accounting now. So, I think that, in general, on the portfolio, you might
see some movement, but it's not going to change our approach and our appetite for
illiquid assets.

Morgan. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you and good afternoon, Giulio. Just one question I have with respect to,
again, going back to Farooq's question on runoﬀ. I mean, runoﬀ in this quarter was quite
low, I think 1 point something versus, say, 2%, 2.5% normal run rate. And at the same time,
obviously, CAT was a bit lower as well. But even if I normalize both of them to your
historical levels, it looks like you could be hitting 98% -- or 92.5% of combined ratio. That's
what I'm kind of getting a bit more cleaner number, which is better than your 93% ratio.
Now, typically, I don't want to go into decimal places, but because 0.5% or 1% is still
relevant combined ratio, I just want to get a bit more color. Is this the right way of thinking
about it? Because you also mentioned that travel is coming back, the state scheme will
give you higher proﬁts, which will oﬀset any motor. So, there is no negative drag from
there. So, any thoughts on that would be helpful.

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

So, I would say that, okay, the only thing I can tell you, the quality of the 93% combined
ratio is good. So, clearly, then, if I say this statement, one can also derive the conclusion
that the 93% can be lower than that. I would really not go into this kind of consideration
on a quarterly basis. The only thing I can tell you, the quality is good. And also as we are
thinking about the future, we might think about deﬁnitely bringing this combined ratio,
93%, as an indication below that level. And it might be that we are already positioned well
to do that, but I will not really over-analyze a quarter. So, the only message I can give to
you is that we have our 93% combined ratio, we feel good about the quality of the 93%
combined ratio.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

Thank you very much, and good afternoon to everyone. Two questions. First on life
insurance. The new business margin you mentioned in France is clearly insuﬃcient and
you said that you need to do additional work there. Can you elaborate a little bit on what
you want to do in France? Second question on Allianz Direct. The gross premium
development in the ﬁrst quarter was fairly low in my view, looks a bit disappointing. I
would have expected in times of corona that Allianz Direct would grow more. Instead, you
shrunk. Is that -- is Allianz Direct below your expectations? Internal growth there was
minus 11%. What is going wrong at Allianz Direct?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Okay. Well, thank you for your question, Michael. So, starting from France. The point in
France, the new business margin, we are taking actions and indeed no product that we
launched has a new business margin. You need to do some economic calculation. We're
not going to go into the details, but let's say the new business margin of the product is
more about 1.5% to 2%. So, over time, you're going to see that ﬂowing -- ﬂow, but we
need to clearly build up that business more over time. We need to get to a better
performance in our protection business and then potentially we need to try and see how
we can push more pure unit-linked business.
So, I wouldn't say that we are not taking action. So, we have been taking action. You see
there is already at least an improvement compared to the Q1 of last year. We think that by
the end of the year, you're going to see an improvement compared to the full year 2020,
but that's an area where we need to push a little bit harder on the mix and we need to see
whether the new hybrid product that we have been launched is going to be enough to
position the company the way we like or whether we need to have even a stronger
change in the mix and think more about unit-linked solution the same way we did in Italy,
where the reposition has been extremely strong. And I want to also highlight the 1.5% of
new business margin in Italy in reality is very good because you are talking about unitlinked with very high eﬃciencies, also short-term unit-linked. So, sometimes, it's also
important to understand that the new business margin is not -- is a KPI that one has to
really look into to appreciate the quality of the KPI. So, in France, we are taking action. We
are not there where we want to be. But if we need to take strong action on the mix, we are
going to do that. So, I think we're going to have the response in the course of 2021.
On Direct, the reason why premiums are down compared to the prior period is that we
basically decided to go out of the aggregator. There was a decision in Germany. And the
reason was that the proﬁtability was very, very poor. So, we basically canceled that
business. Also in Italy, we are still in the aggregator, but we decided to follow a sort of
Page 16 of 21



FINAL

Company Name: Allianz SE
Company Ticker: ALV GR Equity
Date: 2021-05-12

hard line on proﬁtability. So, from that point of view, yes, you see premium going down,
but that's almost adjusting the baseline. So, we have basically created no IT platform, we
have created no business model. And also, we have a diﬀerent view on what we think is
good and proﬁtable and what we think is not really good and proﬁtable. And this
explains, I think, also about that if you had this aggregator business, which was not very
proﬁtable and this was part of the gigantic Allianz physique, the impact was relatively
minor. When you put this on a smaller scale, then you see things that you don't like. And
so, I will say that from a discipline point of view, that's a positive because, clearly, what was
maybe just a very minor issue in a bigger portfolio, this becomes a little bit of a more
visible issue in a smaller portfolio. And we didn't like it and we made changes.
Other point to say on Direct, I will not measure the success of Direct in quarters. Strategic
decision of this relevance, they get -- they have to be measured over a time horizon of
years. So, from that point of view, I think we have now created the platform. We have
created the -- or from the portfolio whether we think it makes sense and then let's see
what happens in the next two, three years and then we're going to judge the success of
this initiative.

All right. We'll go ahead and take our next question from Dominic O'Mahony with Exane
BNP Paribas. Please go ahead, Dominic.

Q - Dominic O'Mahony
Hello. Three questions from me, if that's all right. Firstly, I think you've extended the
duration of your assets to be on the length of your liabilities in Life in addition to P&C
now. Just curious to understand the rationale for that. Is this to control the rate sensitivity
in a solvency position or is it something else? Second question, just on AGI, very strong
ﬂows. Can you just remind us sort of of the changes there? Familiar with the costs and sort
of eﬃciency changes, but could you just remind us maybe on the product side if there's
anything driving the very strong ﬂows there? And then thirdly, in April, EIOPA announced
a review of value for money in unit-linked and hybrid savings products. Can you just
comment on any expectations, any potential risks you see from that review? Thank you.

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

Yeah. So, I couldn't get the ﬁrst question anyway, asset duration standards. Why? Okay.
On the asset duration, sometimes this happens, we need to make -- we expand the asset
duration because we might be short. So, we go longer, then rates go up and then you
end up being on the other side of the spectrum. So, it's always a little bit of an adjustment
that we do as we see the -- what is happening on the market, but we are always a little bit
Page 17 of 21



Company Name: Allianz SE

Date: 2021-05-12

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

behind. So, that's the reason why sometimes we are under-shorting on the duration,
sometimes we are over-shorting. Fundamentally, the idea is that we want to be durationneutral. So, we are not going to run with the duration gap one way or the other for -- on
the Life side for an extended period. But, again, always keep in mind that rates are
moving and we are always kind of following a little bit the rates movement.
On AGI and the ﬂows, when you look at where the ﬂows are coming basically from, I
would say, from Asia Paciﬁc, we see more ﬂows that we saw in the past, so there's
deﬁnitely something new and we have a very strong equity story, also, especially in Asia,
but we also saw nice ﬂows coming in Europe. So, from a distribution point of view, we are
pretty strong in these two areas. From a production point of view, we are producing -where we are producing the asset, this is coming also from the United States. So, we have,
I think, a good combination of a strong manufacturing platform and then we are capable
to place this solution in Europe. And right now, there is a lot of growth also coming from
Asia Paciﬁc. I think also the ESG topic is something that we are stressing and that can be
helpful. And also, I will say, before we were trying to push a lot of diﬀerent strategies. And
maybe when you push too many strategies, then you lose focus and then maybe you are
more confusing for the clients. When you are putting more focus and pushing just a few
strategies, you might not have the same level of diversiﬁcation, if you want, but if you are
doing a good job, you might get better eﬀectiveness. So, I think these are the changes
that the new management team has done and they are playing pretty nicely. I would also
not underestimate the new CEO, he was the head of distribution. So, I -- so if you put me
in charge of AGI, you might see a diﬀerent outcome. So, everybody has to do his job. And
I think that might be also a reason why we see a diﬀerent distribution eﬀectiveness in AGI.
The last question, the hybrid and -- we always look internally at what is the value for
money for our policyholder. We do this in Life. We do this also in Property-Casualty. But
one of the reason why our growth in France in Property-Casualty was low this quarter is
because we decided to dismiss some business because of -- we were not happy with the
amount of commission versus the loss ratio. So, these are considerations that we always
do. And so from that point of view, we should be positioned in a way that when the
regulator is going to come out with any kind of speciﬁc guidance, we should be able to,
either to be already there or to adjust to it very, very, very quickly, but customer value has
been -- since years for us on the P&C side and even more, I would say, on the Life side has
always been one of the indication that we -- the things that we look at. We have a
framework here at Allianz, where we are rating our products in a diﬀerent category, like
AAA, AA, A, all this way, all these kind of an S&P ratings. And one of the criteria in order to
be a AAA product is that there is customer value. Otherwise, if you don't take customer
value, I think that's almost an entry point to have a conversation about the product.

Okay. So, on the ﬂows, on asset management, and you can also then look at page 27, you
can see where the ﬂows are coming from. So, I can give you a little bit on -- idea because
you're asking also maybe PIMCO versus AGI. When you look at the ﬂows at page 27 from
-- in ﬁxed income, clearly, they are mostly coming from PIMCO. We are going to look at
the equity side, they are coming from AGI. And I will say, when you look at multi-assets
and alternative is fairly split between the two. So, basically, you see the strength of PIMCO
playing in ﬁxed income, you see the strength of AGI playing in equities. And then on the
other two asset classes, both are contributing.
When you look at Asia Paciﬁc, as I was saying before, clearly, there is also a nice
contribution from PIMCO, but I will say the contribution from AGI is pretty strong and
over-proportional. And then when you look at Europe, you can imagine that AGI is a little
bit stronger. Then in America, PIMCO is deﬁnitely taking the lion's share. So, overall, I
would say you see strength across the board in both entities. Clearly, one is playing some
strengths more than other, but it's very well diversiﬁed, especially when you put the two
entities together, you get to a very nice diversiﬁed ﬂows revenue. And I think that's very
important.
The other day -- or a couple of months ago, I was looking -- I don't know why, but I was
looking how S&P is doing the rating of asset manager companies. There was a very
interesting reading, that's a lot about the diversiﬁcation of revenue, the diversiﬁcation by
geography, the diversiﬁcation also you might have in your distribution channel. So, this is
something that we are keeping in our mind how we can create as much as diversiﬁcation
as possible. And I think this picture tells you that deﬁnitely we are getting ﬂows from
diﬀerent areas of our portfolio.
On the proﬁt consensus, I do my job, you do your job. You -- somehow we'll get
consensus and then when I -- we look at that, then we make our comments. And on the
expectation for the future, I would say, we're talking in the Capital Market Day, that's
where we can really talk about that. I can just tell you that based on where we are now, we
think we are going to have a good set of numbers this year and then this is going to be a
good starting point for the future.

(Multiple Speakers) also thank you. Sorry? (Multiple Speakers) Yes, well, I'd love that. Can
you say a word about ﬂows in April and May?

A - Giulio Terzariol

FINAL

Yeah. The ﬂows, I can tell you the numbers of April, they were EUR8 billion ﬂows, half and
half between PIMCO and AGI.

Hi. It's still KBW as far as I know. Giulio, can you just tell me, so one question, why is the
ratio of acquisition expenses to PVNBP so low in your Life division this quarter? Your
disclosure says it's 6.8%, it's normally about 8%. And it's quite eye-catching that whilst
your revenue has been strong, your acquisition expenses have gone down. And that's
happened in all four of the parts of the Life and Health, so it doesn't seem to be a
business mix issue.

A - Giulio Terzariol

{BIO 17125489 <GO>}

No. I think it's a business mix issue at the end of the day. And -- because we did not really
change the compensation strategy in a signiﬁcant way. I can also give you an example,
that's always easier for me to talk about Allianz Life. There, you see, for example, a
reduction of the -- of this ratio and that's driven by the fact that we are selling more IVA
versus ﬁxed index annuity. And in IVA, the present value commission of the present level,
the commission of the present value of new business premium is going to be lower. It's
also shorter duration product, by the way. So, it's mostly mix related. And the case of
Allianz (Technical Diﬃculty) so sometimes even within a company, you might see a
reduction, but then you need to drill to dig deeper into the company and then you're
going to see that change in business mix within the companies can make a diﬀerence.
And think about the fact that we are changing business mix signiﬁcantly. So, just to come
back to the point of Allianz Life, right now, we are basically 50-50 between ﬁxed index
annuity and IVA. It was not -- so the IVA production is matching the ﬁxed index annuity
production. That was not the case last year. And there are other similar cases in other OEs.
So, that's also a sign of the change in business mix that we are doing.
