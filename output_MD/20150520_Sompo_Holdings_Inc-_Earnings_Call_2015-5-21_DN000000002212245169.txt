Yukinori Kuroda

{BIO 19776286 <GO>}

I'm Kuroda, from IR office of Sompo Japan Nipponkoa Holdings. Thank you very much for
attending our conference call today. I would like to take you through the financial results
for fiscal year 2014 and the full-year forecast for fiscal year 2015, which was just
announced. Please refer to the presentation material as well as the excel data book
available on our HP, homepage. Our new management strategy will be announced by our
CEO Mr. Sakurada in a separate IR meeting scheduled for Wednesday, May 27.
Please turn to page two, here is the summary, ordinary profit doubled JPY208.3 billion up
JPY95.9 billion due to the improvement of domestic P&C profitability. Net income
improved by 10.1 billion to JPY54.2 billion covering the one-time merger cost.
The results were higher than the forecast excluding the impact of corporate income tax
reduction. Thanks to the improved underwriting profit of domestic P&C favorable asset
management environment and profit contribution from life insurance and overseas. For
fiscal year 2015, both revenue and profit are expected to grow with the underwriting
profit growing further ordinary profit is forecast to be JPY230 billion, up 21.6 billion and
the net income is forecast to be wise JPY160 billion up JPY105.7 billion. That is three times
compared with the last year, mainly due to the absence one off merger related expenses.
Reduction in strategic holding stock was JPY86 billion showing a good progress. Our
policy is to constantly reduce the strategic holding stock in fiscal year 2015. We have
announced details of shareholder return policy today as well dividend for fiscal year '14
was increased by JPY10 and one off fiscal year 2015 will be increased by another JPY10 to

JPY80 per share. Also announced was a share buyback program of JPY17 billion as part of
the return policy to shareholders.

FINAL

Please turn to page three. Please refer to page three, overview of the financial results.
Net premiums written was up 10.5% due to increased revenue Sompo Japan Nipponkoa
as well as contributions from Maritima in Brazil and Canopius. I have also discussed
ordinary profit and net income. I will show you the background on the next page.
This is the date breakdown of underwriting profit. Core underwriting profit is up JPY43.8
billion excluding noise thanks to the improved revenue from automotive insurance. In
addition, item number four snow damage. The impact was significantly positive for fiscal
year 2014. As a result total underwriting profit improved to JPY45.2 billion leading to a
total improvement of almost JPY100 billion.
Next page shows the breakdown of consolidated net income. It has doubled mainly
because of the improvement in underwriting profit of Sompo Japan Nipponkoa as well as
the contribution from Life Insurance and overseas business, which covered the decline in
proceed from sale of equity shares in our asset management.

Bloomberg Transcript

Please refer to page six for net income due to the one-time merger cost Sompo Japan
Nipponkoa holding is slightly down. Total income. However, grew to JPY54.2 billion with a
contribution from Himawari Life Insurance and overseas subsidiaries.
Page seven shows you the details of extraordinary items. One time merger cost is a
negative JPY79.5 billion, corporate income tax impact is a negative JPY18.1 billion driving
down net income for the year. These are excluded. However, from the adjusted profit as
a special item and should not affect the approval for shareholder return.
One time merger cost is in line with the expectation of JPY80 billion including system
costs. Because it was JPY79.5 billion. I will discuss the impact of in income tax reduction on
next page. Tax reduction itself is positive for the financial results for a single year.
However, there is a negative impact due to the reversal of deferred tax assets. The
impact is negative JPY19.6 billion for Sompo Japan Nipponkoa and JPY1.7 billion for
Himawari Life. There is a technical positive impact of JPY3.2 billion for the DTA. Therefore
the total impact is negative JPY18.1 billion for the entire group. As you know, the impact
from tax reduction was not included in the guidance. However, we managed to exceed
the guidance after observing this.
Now FY 2015 full year forecast on page nine, net premiums return is expected to grow
3.9% mainly due to the increased revenues of Sompo Japan Nipponkoa and the
Canopius. For ordinary profit and net income I have already discussed this at the
beginning, adjusted consolidated profit is expected to rise to JPY228 billion even on an
adjusted profit basis. This is an increase of JPY89.6 billion, from 180 billion to 210 billion
was the guidance, so we exceeded the plan.
On page 10, you see the breakdown of ordinary income. In the new year, we expect
further growth mainly from the increase in core insurance underwriting profit. On the other

hand, although we have the absence of the positive impact from snow damage, the
conservative forecast of investment profits as well the total income is expected to grow
JPY21.6 billion.

FINAL

Let me discuss each business on page 12. Please check the numbers related to the fiscal
year 2014 performance of Sompo Japan Nipponkoa on this page. I will give you the details
on the next page onward.
On page 13 net premiums return was up 4.8% for 2014. For the fiscal year. fire and allied
lines performed well for household corporate and reinsurance. Voluntary automobile
benefited from revisions of products and premiums. Others also helped boosting the
overall performance. We expect another good year in fiscal year 2015 by segment fire
and allied lines is down because of the absence of reinsurance contract from Canopius,
which was acquired last year. On the other hand voluntary automobile is expected to grow
revenue from the revised pricing last year.

Page 14 is written basis loss ratio. It went up in fiscal year 2014 due to snow damage
related payments. The mere absence of that item will allow an improvement of 3.5 points
to 59.7%.
On the next page, we are showing the trends and the projection for the earned incurred
base loss ratio. We've been seeing the improvement trend for the earned incurred loss
ratio reasons are because of the improvement of the loss ratio in the voluntary
automobile insurance line and also the less impact from the natural disasters in FY 2014. In
FY 2015 we are assuming earned incurred loss ratio of 60.2%, which is a further 3.6%
improvement. Excluding natural disasters losses, earned incurred loss has been showing
improvement trend since 2011. So this indicates the steady improvement of the underlying
profit generation capability.
Please go to page 16 for the business expense ratio. Net expense ratio has been
improving steadily, driven by the improvement of the company expense ratio. If you look
at net expense ratio, excluding compulsory lines net expense ratio has improved by 0.6
points in 2014% to 33.6% and in FY 2015, we are assuming further improvement of 0.5
point to 33.1%.
Please go to the next page for the combined ratio. This is written based loss ratio and net
expense ratio some of it. As a result of an improvement of these two factors combined
ratio is assumed to be 92% level. So we are planning on the improvement of the
combined ratio. If you go to the next page, we are showing the combined ratio in the
voluntary automobile insurance line we have been seeing the steady improvement of the
combined ratio in this area, because of the product division and the pricing division and
also the impact on the rates -- fleet rate system division. It has improved to 94.8% already
and we are assuming the further improvements to 92.3% in this fiscal year.
Please go to the next page for the investment profit. In FY 2014 investment profit resulted
at JPY151.5 billion, which is higher than the original expectation of JPY132.2 billion because
of the continuation of the investment environment trending favorably continuously on the

FINAL

back of the value on the stock exchange and the depreciation of the yen the reason for
the higher investment profit is because of the higher realized gains on sale of securities
higher interest and dividend income and ForEx gains.
And for FY 2015, we are projecting investment profits to be JPY106 billion, which is lower
year-on-year major reasons as follows. First ForEx gains losses which are assumed more
conservatively and more conservative assumption gains from sale of securities and some
foreign bonds that we hold for the pure investment purpose. On top of that we are
assuming some impairment losses of group company securities which weigh on the
investment profits at the parent level, but it's neutral to be consolidated investment profit
because it's adjusted in the consolidated adjustment line.
Please go to page 20 this is a projection for FY 2015 for Sompo Japan Nipponkoa.
Combined ratio is projected to be improved by 4.1 points which would be offset partially
by the investments profit being lower year-on-year. But because of the lower
extraordinary loss such as the one-time merger cost we assuming a significant
improvement of the net income.

Bloomberg Transcript

Please go to page 21 for assumptions behind FY 2015 guidance. In terms of natural
disasters, we are assuming JPY43 million for FY 2015. Let me go through the changes
from the previous year. First, we have change the provisional rates to the catastrophe
reserve in the voluntary automobile insurance area. Conventionally, in the past, our
provision rate to the catastrophe reserve in the automobile group was 5.5% but it was
(inaudible) which gives the positive impact on the underwriting profit.
And also for the premium on the performance evaluation basis and the number of
reported claims and the natural disaster situation, explained on page 22 to page 25. So
please refer to them later on. Please move to page 27 for Himawari Life. We haven't seen
any significant trend change since Q3 but amount of new business has declined slightly
due to somewhat slowdown of sales of the first sector, such as income compensation
insurance.
But annualized premium is on the increasing trend on the back of strong sales of medical
insurance. For FY 2014 ordinary profit was JPY22.5 billion or JPY5.3 billion improvement
year-on-year, net income was JPY9.7 billion or JPY1.6 improvement year-on-year. For 2015
we are assuming ordinary profit of JPY20.2 billion and net income of JPY10.2 billion and
we are trying to expand sales of protection type products to improve amount of business
in force.
Please turn to page 28 for J-GAAP based earnings for the life business. In 2014 both basic
profit and net income trended strongly, there was a technical reason for the basic profit in
2014, which was related to the new product launch in the medical area, because we
launched a new product in the medical area, there was a shift from the existing medical
insurance product to the new product.
And because of that, there was a temporary surrender from the existing medical product
which required us to diverse the reserve and in FY 2015 there is an absence from this one

time boosting factor from the reversal [ph] gains in the medical insurance area, we are
assuming slightly lower basic profit.

FINAL

Please go to page 29 for the trend of sales in P&C insurance channel and weight of
protection type products. There has been no change in the trend. Sales in the P&C
insurance channels are increasing steadily and weight of protection type products is
stayed at high level, which is about 70%.
Please go to page 30 for MCEV as you can see MCEV is on the increasing trend in 2014
because of the launch of the new product in the medical area our sales are going very
well. On the other hand, there is a negative impact on the lower interest rates. On top of
that there was an impact from the shift from the older product to the new product in the
medical area, meaning there was a temporary increase in the surrender ratio which put
the weight on the growth of MCEV. MCEV increased from JPY750.3 billion in 2013 end to
JPY784.4 billion at the end of 2014.
For 2015 we are assuming JPY90 billion EV increases which will total JPY877.4 billion MCEV
at the end of 2015. In the original management plan, we were assuming MCEV increase in
the range of JPY100 billion to JPY110 billion in 2015, but we have incorporated the interest
rate environments difference between the time we made our plan and the current
environment of interest rates.

Bloomberg Transcript

Please go to page 32 for overseas businesses. Overseas businesses trended very
steadily. Net premiums written increased due to the contribution from the start of the
consolidation of Canopius and the strong performance from Yasuda Maritima.
Net income in 2014, increased to JPY18.6 billion. Thanks to the contribution from the
Canopius and strong performance from Turkey, Malaysia and Singapore. So we have
already achieved the assumption of the range from the overseas businesses of JPY14
billion to JPY20 billion in our management plan. For FY 2015, our net income projection is
JPY19.2 billion which shows an increase year-on-year and the reason why we are
projecting a smaller increase of the net income, there are mainly three reasons, first which
is related to the ForEx. For 2014 results, results are reported at exchange rates prevailing
at the end of December for the local subsidiaries, but for the guidance for 2015 we are
applying exchange rates at the end of March.
So the gap between the two generates about JPY10 billion increase of the net income
and also we are assuming more conservative assumption for the investment profits. And
the third reason relates to the one-time gains on sales securities mainly at Canopius,
which does not repeat in 2015.
Please go to page 33. This is a breakdown by region. Top line is growing in Europe and
South America and net income improvement is contributed by Europe and Asia. So the
trend has not been changed from Q3. Please go to page 34 for the breakdown by each
group company. Please confirm later.

Please move to page 36 for the investment portfolio, the total amount of investment
assets amounts to JPY9.3 trillion [ph] both for P&C and the Life we are increasing
investments and assets such as foreign bonds where we can assume higher returns
because of the low interest environment, but the basic policy of the investment is not
changing. For the asset portfolio and the duration please refer to page 37 for Sompo
Japan Nipponkoa and please refer to page 38 for Himawari Life. Please refer to page 39
for the progress that we're making against the America management targets. This
completes my explanation. Thank you so much.

Questions And Answers
Operator
First question is from Mr. Muraki from Deutsche Securities. Pleas go ahead with your
question.

Q - Masao Muraki

{BIO 3318668 <GO>}

Thank you so much for taking my questions. My question is on page 15, which is about EI
based loss ratio. Last year it didn't improve so much, but this year for 2015 you are
assuming an improvement of EI loss ratio of 2.2 points would you please give me reasons
why you are assuming the improvement of 2.2 points for FY 2015?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Yukinori Kuroda

{BIO 19776286 <GO>}

It's probably because of the improvement from the voluntary automobile insurance where
you raised the prices and you get the benefits with some time lag.

Q - Masao Muraki

{BIO 3318668 <GO>}

But would you please give me assumptions behind?

A - Yukinori Kuroda

{BIO 19776286 <GO>}

We can see the stability for the automobile insurance.

Q - Masao Muraki

{BIO 3318668 <GO>}

And also last year you put additional provisioning to the outstanding loss reserve in areas,
other than Voluntary automobile insurance line. In 2014 you said you would -- with
additional provisioning to the outstanding loss reserve, but in reality in 2014 how much
additional provisioning did you put for the outstanding loss reserves and may I understand
that does not repeat in 2015?

A - Yukinori Kuroda

{BIO 19776286 <GO>}

Thank you so much for your question Mr. Muraki. For EI loss ratio yes, as you pointed out
correctly in 2015, we are assuming more than 2 points improvements in EI loss ratio for
2015, there are mainly two reasons for the improvement.

Page 6 of 15



FINAL

Company N ame: Sompo H oldings I nc
Company Ticker: 8630 JP Equity
Date: 2015-05-20

First, as you mentioned correctly. We are assuming a significant improvement from the
Voluntary automobile insurance line. And the second reason relates to the snow damage
development, which we had last year, which was around little bit more than JPY20 billion.
And that doesn't repeat in 2015. So in the fire line EI loss ratio will improve in the fire line
as well. In terms of the Voluntary automobile insurance first, as you [ph] mentioned
correctly, we raised rates last year Sompo Japan raised its rates in July. Nipponkoa raises
its rates in September and majority of the benefit will be reflected in 2015. Actually 60%
to 70% of the benefit from the price increase will be defected in 2015.
That's why we are assuming slightly stronger growth of the top line in the Voluntary
automobile insurance line. In terms of the frequency, for the guidance for the projection
for 2015 we are not assuming so much improvement. We are assuming frequency to be
almost flat, but in reality, when we look at the trend of the number of reported claims -number of reported claims is still on the declining trend.

Bloomberg Transcript

So we have the positive factor there. On the other hand repair cost is increasing by about
1% to 2%. There are still increasing trend of repair cost. So we incorporated a positive
factor and a negative factor as explained and the claims payment for the Voluntary
automobile insurance is assumed to be almost flat. Therefore, the premium is increasing
claims payment is almost flat as an assumption. As a result EI loss ratio is improving in
2015.
And In other lines other than Voluntary automobile insurance, last year we had large
policies acquired last year. So we put the additional provisioning to the outstanding loss
reserve. In the other insurance lines we had JPY14.3 billion additional provisioning to the
outstanding loss reserves, last year and for the guidance of 2015 we are assuming to
JPY4.3 billion additional provisioning to the outstanding loss reserve. So, there is an
improvement between 2014 and 2015 in this regard.
This is the a total image, this is the assumption always accounting department tries to put
the appropriate assumptions, but sometimes assumptions are aggressive sometimes
assumptions are conservative. But this time we think assumption for 2015 is a realistic
level.

Q - Masao Muraki

{BIO 3318668 <GO>}

I have a follow-up question. The line in grey on page 15 excludes snow development
right?

A - Yukinori Kuroda

{BIO 19776286 <GO>}

Exactly, grey line excludes the snow damage development. The red line indicates the
improvement of 3.6 points and the grey line shows an improvement of the 2.2 points. So
you're not far off if you assume the difference between the two is relating to the snow
damage development.

Q - Masao Muraki

{BIO 3318668 <GO>}

Thank you.

Thank you so much. Next question is from Ms. Tsujino JPMorgan. Please go ahead with
your question.

FINAL

Q - Natsumu Tsujino

{BIO 2234779 <GO>}

Thank you so much for taking my questions. My question may relate to the question
previously asked, but let me ask the same question from a different perspective, when I
look at underwriting profit projection for Sompo Japan Nipponkoa for FY 2015 your
underwriting profit projection is JPY88 billion, which is shows a significant improvement
from FY 2014 when we generated JPY45.2 billion when you exclude all catastrophe lossrelated items there is a provisioning of net catastrophe reserve you are assuming slightly
over JPY22 billion net provision to the catastrophe reserve for 2015, in 2014 you had the
reversal of the catastrophe reserve, which was JPY2.5 billion [ph] and natural disasters for
2014 were JPY33.2 billion and the snow no damage was JPY26 billion.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the other hand, you are assuming JPY43 billion natural disaster loss for 2015. So
excluding the natural disaster losses and catastrophic loss reserve that means you are
assuming improvement of JPY60 billion before tax from 2014 to 2015. And I'm sure
there's an improvement coming from the voluntary automobile insurance area but so far,
you mentioned that you had cost reductions of JPY26 billion year on year and there is a
positive impact from the price increases one in September and one in July they are still
remaining benefits coming from the price increase of about JPY20 billion or more.
But considering these two factors you are still assuming larger improvement, which is
JPY60 billion So that means in other areas you have JPY20 billion to JPY30 billion
improvement, is that right understanding?

A - Yukinori Kuroda

{BIO 19776286 <GO>}

Thank you so much for your question. Actually, the majority of the improvement of the
underwriting profit or underwriting balance is projected to come from fire line and
Voluntary automobile line. Underwriting profit is projected to be JPY88 billion for 2015,
which is JPY42.7 billion improvement year-on-year.
For the calculation of combined ratio if you look at the underwriting balance excluding
catastrophe loss reserve, we're assuming JPY139.1 billion for 2015, which is 79.5
improvement year-on-year. So probably I should use underwriting balance number to
answer your question of the improvement of the underwriting balance of 79.5 billion yearon-year it's broken down into JPY39.5 billion improvement form the net premiums written
in the automobile insurance area and a JPY45 billion lower loss paid.
So because of these two positive contributions we are assuming close to JPY80 billion
improvement of the underwriting balance and the majority of the improvement of the net
payments written is expected to come from automobile voluntary line that's because of
the price increase impact and the volume increase and other factors. And the reason why
we are assuming lower loss paid is because of the snow damage. As I said this loss which
is JPY45 billion, majority of that is coming from the fire area. So in other areas, there
Page 8 of 15



Company N ame: Sompo H oldings I nc
Company Ticker: 8630 JP Equity
Date: 2015-05-20

should be a positive contribution of JPY5 billion. Excluding the noises the underlying
improvement is coming from automobile line and the fire line and base business
improvements.

Q - Natsumu Tsujino

{BIO 2234779 <GO>}

FINAL

Understood. How about cost savings?

A - Yukinori Kuroda

{BIO 19776286 <GO>}

Yes net business expense is projected to be almost flat year-on-year. Although net
business expense ratio is assumed to be improved year-on-year. So there are mergerrelated cost savings we show cost savings versus 2011 merger related cost savings versus
2011 level. In 2014 we have already realized JPY31.8 billion cost savings.
And for 2015 we are projecting JPY50 billion merger related cost savings. So the
difference between the two years is JPY18 billion. So we are assuming cost savings
benefit in 2015 of JPY18 billion year-on-year. Thanks to the higher net payment written
offset by advanced system investment for IFRS [ph] and ERM. That's why we are assuming
net business expense to be flat year-on-year.

Q - Natsumu Tsujino

{BIO 2234779 <GO>}

Understood. My last question is the difference between consolidated and nonconsolidated. It's a different topic, but I'm on page three. When I look at ordinary profit for
2014 versus 2015, if you go to the consolidation adjustment/other line, it was minus 27
billion in 2014, but it will be reduced to plus JPY2.5 billion.
When I look at purchases method gap in 2014, it was JPY14.5 and the purchase method
gap shouldn't be so large in 2015. So that means in other areas there should be items
that contribute to the lower negative number of the consolidation assessment/other, what
are those numbers?

A - Yukinori Kuroda

{BIO 19776286 <GO>}

That's because of the impairment loss of the consolidated subsidiaries stocks, which is
about JPY20 billion which is being assumed for 2015. But on the consolidated basis that's
adjusted in the consolidation assessment line. So it's flat, it's neutral on the consolidation
basis.

FINAL

Q - Koichi Niwa

{BIO 5032649 <GO>}

Thank you so much for taking my questions. My first question is about internal solvency
ratio. If you have the data with you now would you please tell me the level of internal
solvency ratio, which was 163% at the end of first half, what is the level now.

A - Yukinori Kuroda

{BIO 19776286 <GO>}

Because of the rally in the stock market at the end of March, it became 170%.

Q - Koichi Niwa

{BIO 5032649 <GO>}

Thank you so much. My second question relates to the shareholders' return policy. You
decided to increase the dividend in 2014, originally, you've been saying that your policy
was to pay stable dividend, but would you please give in the background, why you
increased DPS to JPY70 per share. I'm sorry to ask this ahead of the time, but for March
2016 based upon the guidance that you showed us today, it means that you do share
buyback or by about JPY35 billion. Is that the right calculation, is that the right thinking
based upon the guidance for March 2016?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Yukinori Kuroda

{BIO 19776286 <GO>}

Thank you for your questions for 2014 yes, we have decided to increase the DPS to JPY70
and for FY 2015, we decided to increase by JPY10 to make DPS JPY80 per share. So it's a
package and conventionally we have been saying that we'd like to pay at the minimum
JPY60 share (inaudible) the minimum level. So that's a basic policy, but I do not deny the
increasing trend of the dividend.
Profit level of the company has been improving the underlying base profit earnings
generation capability has been improving and because of the recent rally in the stock
market our dividend yield is on the decline. Therefore listening to opinions and the
feedback from various investors, we decided to increase the dividend for 2014 and
projected for 2015 concerning comprehensively various factors.
And my answer to your next question, which is about the share buyback yes your
calculation is rights if you calculate based upon the adjusted earnings projection for FY
2015 so yes, you're right up until 2015 our shareholder return policies stays the same.
We'd like to maintain the capital policy and shareholder return policy in the current
management plan up to 2015, meaning, we'd like to be pay stable dividend and they do
flexible share buyback and our target in the medium term is to pay out 50% of divested
earnings excluding the life business.
So under the current circumstance that's all I can say because the future returns is
undecided, but based upon this level, we are going to continue level returns for the
future. For 2015 onwards we are currently in the process of starting the next medium-term

Page 10 of 15

Q - Wataru Otsuka

{BIO 16340098 <GO>}

Thank you. Sorry for asking this question again, but I would like to ask you about the
shareholder return again. For the fiscal year that has just ended the dividend was JPY28.5
billion and the share buyback program JPY17 billion excluding some of the stock options.
So the totals shareholders' return was JPY45.5 billion excluding the life Insurance the
adjusted profit is 90 billion or a little bit more than that so 50% would be the shareholder
return ratio is this correct. That's my question.

Thank you, Mr. Osaka. I think the formula that you have just used is correct. And that's
exactly how we are looking at the shareholder return and we are looking at those
numbers and deciding the amount of shareholder, share buyback program. And that's
how we have decided the amount.

{BIO 16340098 <GO>}

I have an additional question. My understanding was that 50% was the target for the
medium-term. However, for the fiscal year, which has just ended you have already realized
50% shareholder return ratio although we don't know what is going to be for fiscal year
2015. However, have you changed the shareholder return policy. How can I understand the
medium-term target of 50%?

A - Yukinori Kuroda

{BIO 19776286 <GO>}

Well, basically the company has not changed the shareholder return policy. So the medium
term total shareholder return the target is still 50%. However, in view of the expectations
of shareholders, sensed the market as well as the ongoing increase in profit as well as the
net asset, we have made a decision on the 2014 shareholder return ratio.
For the next year, fiscal year 2015 we still have to wait until we have a clear view about the
financial results in order to decide the shareholder return for the 2015 we would like to
pay due attention to shareholders' expectations as well.

FINAL

Thank you. My second question is about the newspaper article which appeared at the
beginning of May, which says Sompo Japan Nipponkoa is lowering premiums for its
automotive insurance starting in October. Has the company made that decision already.
The second question is if that is the case, I think, what is the impact on the underwriting
balance, as well as the loss ratio, I suppose the impact will be positive since the company
is expecting an improvement in combined ratio in automotive. That's my question.

A - Yukinori Kuroda

{BIO 19776286 <GO>}

Thank you for your question. The company has not decided or made any announcement
on this yet. However, we are considering a similar plan for the revision of the premium in
October. The level that was mentioned in the article is not very different from what we
have been considering. I think it said 0.2% minus. At that level suppose that would be the
case, there is almost no impact, because each level depends on the terms and conditions
of the contract. So what I can say here is that we do not intend to raise the premium. The
revision is meant to keep it flat. That is the intention of October.

Q - Wataru Otsuka

{BIO 16340098 <GO>}

If I could double check, can you confirm that the combined ratio, which is shown on page
18 reflects what you have just explained.

Next question is from Mr. Noda, Goldman Sachs Japan.

Q - Taichi Noda

{BIO 16478436 <GO>}

Thank you. I would like to ask you about the number of claims reported as well as the
strategic holdings shares, regarding the number of claims on page 23 the number is
shown as reported claims which according to the company is expected to go down
further for 2015 what level of decline is expected. What would be the percentage and
also what is the driver for further decline in the number of claims if you could share with us
that's my first question.
My second question is about the reduction in strategic holding shares. How much are you
expecting this year I saw a JPY58.4 billion as gain from the sale of equity holdings for FY
Page 12 of 15

15 does this represent the reduction amount?

FINAL

A - Yukinori Kuroda

{BIO 19776286 <GO>}

Thank you for your question. Regarding the first question the number of reported claims.
In our forecast it is expected to be flat this year. However, if you look at the actual number
of claims in terms of the trend up until the end of March every month it has been declining
at 3% or 7% every month. And according to our latest report the number for April was
down again by 2.2%. So in reality it is still on a downtrend, but in fact in reality the biggest
factor or driver of the decline was the revision of drivers rating system in the past.
However, this factor has been already reflected in the current number except for some
long-term contracts. Therefore, the only factor that can explain the ongoing decline is a
smaller number of accidents, as well as the lighter volume of traffic, which is working in
favor for us.
As for your second question, regarding the strategic holding shares, the actual amount of
reduction for this fiscal year has not been disclosed. However, we have an internal plan
and we're implementing this four-year [ph] plan on an accelerated basis. For an instance
in 2012 and 2013, we have reduced by JPY200 billion respectively and in 2014, we
reduced by JPY86 billion. Internally our plan is to have the same amount of reduction for
the last two years of the full-year plan. Therefore, for 2015 were are aiming at reducing by
JPY100 billion or so. And the gain from those sales have been already announced.

Thank you. Next question is Mr. Sasaki from Merrill Lynch Japan Securities.

Q - Futoshi Sasaki

{BIO 17564798 <GO>}

Thank you. I would like to double check some numbers. The company plans to reduce the
automobile groups reserve ratio from 5.5% to 3.2%. What is the impact in terms of the
value if you could tell us please let us know and also, why is -- in this timing has the
company decided to do that? My understanding was that the company was accumulating
the retained earnings, but has there been enough retained earnings is that that reason
could you give us some background?

A - Yukinori Kuroda

{BIO 19776286 <GO>}

Regarding the reserve ratios for automotive insurance, in terms of the impact the impact
amount is about JPY28 billion. That is a positive impact on the underwriting profit. If I could
give you some background information first of all for the fire insurance we have not
changed the reserve ratio we have been accumulating the reserve as we did before.
However, for the automobile if you look at the past there has not been so many major
payments for the past natural disasters that's we believe that the 3.2% reserve ratio is
adequate for the purpose. That is the decision, we have made. And also regarding why
this timing, in September last year we merged the two companies. Up until then we have
had ratios for each company, but we simply combines the two ratios into one and we
didn't changed the level of reserve ratio after having a chance to review the most
optimized levels.

We had a decision to revise the reserve ratio and also in the earnings report there was a
mentioning about a study that we're conducting about the adoption of IFRS and when we
do that we may not have to -- have the catastrophic loss reserve as part of the
underwriting reserve, we may be able to put it into the net asset and besides, we have
appropriate capital management through ERM.

FINAL

So we don't see any problem.

Q - Futoshi Sasaki

{BIO 17564798 <GO>}

Thank you. Regarding the appraisal loss of a subsidiary recorded a JPY20 billion, if
possible, could you tell us which company, it was responsible for this amount and what
kind of business was the company doing and what went wrong with this company?

A - Yukinori Kuroda

{BIO 19776286 <GO>}

Sorry, I cannot give you the company name, but there was a consolidated subsidiary,
which was posting losses strategically and intentionally and that's the company which is
responsible.

Q - Futoshi Sasaki

{BIO 17564798 <GO>}

Is it life insurance company or P&C company is it the business companies or is it a special
purpose financial company?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Yukinori Kuroda

{BIO 19776286 <GO>}

The company actually is one of the main insurance business companies in the group.

Thank you. Next question is from Mr. Majima Tokai Tokyo Research Center.

Q - Tatsuo Majima

{BIO 15338044 <GO>}

Thank you. I want to ask you about the catastrophic loss reserve ratio again for
automotive insurance. Even though the company may be adopting IFRS suppose that
you're required to put aside the provision anyway under the insurance business act, I think
the reserve was JPY60 billion and it is going down by JPY40 billion. So in the three or four
years, the balance is appearing to become zero because there is no requirement under
the business law. So is it okay for the company to make the balance zero. Although I did
mention about IFRS It is not directly the course of the revision or the change. And there is
no rule that says we can't make the balance zero. So are you saying that in there years or
so the balance may become zero?

It may not be necessarily the case because the lowest ratio is improving.

FINAL

Q - Tatsuo Majima

{BIO 15338044 <GO>}

I suppose that the revision should generate a cost reduction of JPY20 billion to JPY24
billion each year. Is it going to be posted at the end the year or is it going to be posted at
the end of each quarter which means that JPY6 billion each.

A - Yukinori Kuroda

{BIO 19776286 <GO>}

It will be posted at each quarter.
