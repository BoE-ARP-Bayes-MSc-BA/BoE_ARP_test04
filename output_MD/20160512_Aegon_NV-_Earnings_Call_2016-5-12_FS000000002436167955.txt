MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day and welcome to Aegon Q1 Results 2016 Conference Call. Today's conference
is being recorded.
And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Willem van den Berg.
Please go ahead, sir.

Willem van den Berg

{BIO 15203834 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining this conference call on
Aegon's first quarter 2016 results. We will keep today's presentation short, leaving

FINAL

Good morning, everyone. We really appreciate you taking the time to join us on such a
busy day with many companies reporting at the same time. So, let me begin by providing
you with a brief overview of our first quarter results before then going to more detail.
Our results were impacted by the challenging financial market conditions we saw in the
first quarter. Underlying earnings were impacted by lower average equity markets while
net income was impacted by fair value losses as a result of underperformance of
alternative investments and hedges.
While the capital position remains solid and well within our target range, our Solvency II
ratio reflects the return of capital to shareholders and adverse market impacts. Excluding
market impacts and onetime items, capital generation amounted to approximately €300
million.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our strong sales story continues with sales increasing by 36% to €3.6 billion. This growth
was mainly driven by higher deposits of €30 billion and the strategic steps in UK that we
announced recently will drive further growth of our fee-based business.
On slide three, you can see that underlying earnings increased this quarter by €30 million
compared with last year. So, let me run you through the main moving parts. In the
Americas, earnings declined slightly as an improvement in claims experience was more
than offset by lower earnings from fee businesses. This was partly as a result of lower
equity markets, and this is something I will come back to on the next slides.
In Europe, earnings increased by 20% to €169 million. This increase was mainly driven by
lower deferred acquisition costs in the UK. As a result, the write-down of DPAC related to
upgrade in customers to the retirement platform in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Asset Management earnings were again strong at €45 million and benefited from
continued higher inflows (2:59) and performance fees. This quarter, as you all have seen,
we have adjusted our financial reporting to reflect both the growing importance of Asset
Management and our increased focus on Asia. Finally, holding costs declined to €36
million due to lower funding costs following the redemption of senior debt at the end of
last year.
Let me now explain in greater detail on slide four, how the volatility in equity markets
impacted our earnings in the Americas. So, despite significant volatility during the quarter
in financial markets, the S&P 500 ended the quarter almost where it started. However,
equity markets were down significantly for the majority of the quarter, causing our daily
balances to be 4% low on average during the first quarter than at quarter-end. The result
was that lower fees, which are calculated on weighted average balances instead of on
quarter-end, impacted underlying earnings by $15 million.

FINAL

As you can see on slide five, net income amounted to €143 million this quarter and was
impacted by losses from fair value items of €358 million. These losses were driven by
lower than expected returns on alternative investments, particularly hedge funds, as well
as by a macro hedge program in the U.S. and by guarantee hedge programs in the
Netherlands. While our alternative investments showed poor performance, they continued
to perform well on a longer-term horizon.
Despite the fact that we largely have an accounting match in the Netherlands, fair value
hedging, with an accounting match, amounted to a loss of €101 million. This was due to
differences between Solvency II and IFRS on Aegon's interest rate hedges in the
Netherlands. These losses represent less than 5% of the change in liabilities, which
increased by €2.4 billion this quarter.
Fair value hedging, without an accounting match, resulted in a loss of €152 million, mostly
as a result of our macro equity hedge program in the U.S.
Overall, impairments remained low at €36 million or 9 basis points of the general account
on an annualized basis. These were mostly related to energy investments in the U.S.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let me now turn to capital on slide six, starting with our group capital position. Our
Solvency II ratio of 155% puts us at a midpoint of our target range of 140% to 170%. The
ratio declined this quarter as a result of market impacts and returning capital to our
shareholders. On the Solvency II, capital returned to shareholders is deducted from the
ratio at the moment the management decision is made and not when it is made.
Financial markets also had a negative impact on the capital ratio this quarter while the
credit spreads including on Dutch mortgages, rating migrations and lower interest rates,
particularly in the Netherlands and the UK, all contributed negatively to the capital ratio
during the quarter.
Turning to slide seven. The Netherlands, we've made adjustments to our hedging
program, which have an effect on both Solvency II and on IFRS basis. During the first
quarter, we aligned again to hedging program to the Solvency II curve. And given that
there is now an accounting mismatch, we will revisit our IFRS fair value valuation curve in
the third quarter. Differences between our hedging program and the valuation of our
liabilities lead to increased volatility in our IFRS results. Staff pension plans, as measured
by IAS 19 and second order impacts on the Solvency II, both remain un-hedged. We are in
the process of updating our sensitivity.
On slide eight, you can see that, in Q1, we once again generated strong sales in our
deposit businesses. This quarter is the first time that we are reporting Asset Management
separately, and we are understandably very pleased with this unit's continued strong
sales. Increasing gross flows was mainly driven by the inclusion of flows from our
partnership with La Banque Postale Asset Management in France and higher recognized
gross deposits in our Chinese joint venture, AIFMC.

By leveraging our market-leading underwriting capabilities and mortgages for third-party
investors, we continue to generate strong net inflows in the Dutch Mortgage Fund. And
this was the main driver behind the net Asset Management flows of over €1 billion.

FINAL

Net deposit for Retirement Plans increased by 14% to $5 billion, primarily due to the
acquisition of Mercer's DC recordkeeping business. And net deposits were also
supported by our efforts to retain assets in a pension business in the U.S.
In the first quarter of this year, our asset retention rate increased to 20%, and we aim to
further increase the asset retention by continuing to improve how we engage with plan
participants before they retire and by helping them make the right decisions by providing
them with relevant information.
New life sales were down by 11% as higher indexed universal life sales in the U.S. were
more than offset by lower sales in Asia and Poland for linked product changes. And this is
also in part a reflection of our strategic shift to focus on fee-based businesses.

Bloomberg Transcript

I would now like to briefly touch to the Department of Labor's Fiduciary Rule, which has
obviously attracted a lot of attention over the last 12 months. On previous occasions, I
discussed the proposal with you and highlighted our concern that the scope was very
broad, that it was complicated and that it could lead to unintended consequences.
And we are pleased that DOL engaged with the industry, and I'm pleased that the final
rule has improved in many ways, although we still believe it is likely to have a negative
effect about lower- and middle-income earners' access to the advice they need.
The rule will also have implication for some of our distribution partners as a result of the
increased administrative burden and compliance costs. The fact that the DOL has granted
an extended transition period will enable us to adapt our products and the way we
distribute them to the new reality while also supporting the needs of our customers and
distribution partners.
Expect the Fiduciary Rule to have no material impact on our in-force business while we
anticipate the short-term negative impact on our variable annuity sales of approximately
10% to 20%, in line with industry expectations. And we believe this is manageable in the
context of our focus on profitably growing our business.
Let me now turn to expense savings and give you an update on the progress we're
making towards reducing our expenses by €200 million by 2018. As mentioned at our
Investor Day in January, our vision is to create ONE Transamerica in the eyes of all
customers while at the same time increasing the overall efficiency of the organization. This
quarter we have implemented the new U.S. organizational structure within Transamerica
and completed a voluntary separation incentive plan. These expense savings, together
with other expense initiatives, will lead to $40 million of benefit as of the second half of
the year. And this represents an important step towards achieving the $150 million target.

FINAL

Cost savings in the Netherlands and other holdings will mainly come from a reduction of
legacy systems, from reducing complexity and from streamlining processes. By 2018, we
expect these programs to enable us to meet the expense savings target of €200 million,
and we will continue to update you on the progress of our expense-savings program
going forward.
Let me now move to last slide on the steps we took during the first quarter towards
achieving our strategic objectives. First and foremost, we have almost completed the
€400 million share buyback we announced in January and the Association Aegon will
participate in the second tranche of our share buyback program, on a pro rata basis, in
order to maintain the level of voting rights.
In January, we also indicated that we were considering options for our UK annuity book.
And as you know, we concluded that the share was the best option. This resulted in the
recent divestment of two-thirds of this portfolio and we're aiming to divest the remaining
third.
In addition, we reached an agreement to acquire BlackRock's platform-based defined
contribution business in the UK. These transactions will enable us to fully focus on a fastgrowing platform and serve the growing needs of our more than 2 million customers in
the UK.

Bloomberg Transcript

We also announced the divestment of the commercial line, Non-life portfolio in The
Netherlands as we continue to optimize our portfolio by divesting noncore assets while at
the same time investing in businesses that create value and that drive growth.
So, in summary, while our results this quarter were impacted by challenging financial
market conditions, we have made significant steps in achieving our strategic objectives.
We clearly need to make more progress towards our 2018 financial targets. But we can be
confident that we're taking the right actions to transform our company and become a
more agile, a more customer-centric and a more profitable organization.
Thank you, all, again to continuing to pay close interest in our company. Darryl, and I are
now happy to take your questions.

Q&A

Thank you. We'll pause just for a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to signal for
questions.
The first question comes from Ashik Musaddi from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line
is open.

FINAL

Yeah. Hi. Good morning, Alex. Good morning, Darryl. Just a couple of question from me.
First of all, can you give us a bit of update on the UK business? It looks like your capital
dropped from 140%, which should be 155%, post the disposal of UK part business and it's
again back to 140%. What's going on there?
And, I mean, I still don't understand what's the point of – at what point would you decide
whether this is a business you should own or not? Because it looks like it continues to
remain a drag on your earnings or capital at some point every quarter. So, that's the first
one.
And secondly is, in terms of Netherlands, can you give us a bit of color about the capital
drop in that as well? How much of that is related to mortgages, mortgage spread
widening? How much of that is related to the, say, just general interest rate movement?
So, that would be the second question.
And thirdly is can you give us an update on your capital return? I mean, are you
comfortable with that? Are you having a debate with the regulator in terms of, is this
buyback still okay to do or any sort of what is you're getting on your capital position now?
Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Hey, Ashik. It's Darryl. Let me try and answer those questions for you. I'll take them in
order. On the UK, 155% to 140%, the 155% was pro forma number at the end of the year.
And I think we were clear on that on the press release when we put that out. It was early
April at that time, but we didn't have our first quarter Solvency II numbers at that point or
any of the attribution. So, we gave you the year-end numbers. And we have the
sensitivities that were out there to help you understand how that ratio would move over
time. And, in fact, interest rate sensitivity was, as you can see, it's pretty large in the UK.
And I think we had said that it was 17 points per 100-basis-point drop.
The swap spreads or the swap rates dropped about 60 basis points in the UK over the
quarter, and that has – actually has a bit of a leveraging effect. Not only did the rates
dropped significantly but, with swap rates dropping even further, you have a spread effect
as well. So, that made it a little bit larger than the sensitivity.
We also had some – I think the other thing to take into account is that as the UK, as the
annuities are sold off, the denominator gets smaller. So, the ratios themselves get a little
more volatile and the sensitivity have to be ratioed up a little bit for that. So, UK largely is
in line with the sensitivities that we provided earlier.
On the Dutch capital situation, really, a lot of the market impacts that we've noted on the
slide are, in fact, very much related to the Dutch situation. We've had a combination of
really a lot of things going on collectively. It is a little bit difficult to break them all apart and
look at them in singularity because there are some cross-term impacts of all these items.
But mortgage spreads widened in the quarter. That was one of our larger sensitivities and
we've highlighted that basis risk that exists between the volatility adjuster and Dutch

Page 6 of 24

FINAL

mortgage spreads. We've had some credit rating downgrade, Finland in particular as an
example, which came in and impacted the numbers.
And then interest rates, not so much from ALM perspective. We continue to be very
hedged in terms of own funds in the numerator from an interest rate perspective but the
impact on the SCR and the denominator. So, this would be second order impacts on
credit risk, longevity risk, the risk margins. That is where the interest rate impact came
from. And really all of the items that I just mentioned impact the ratio today, but they have
the unwind effect that we mentioned earlier as well. They unwind into the future and the
higher cash flows going forward. So, I think that's important to note when you look at the
Dutch capital ratio situation.
Capital return was your third question. We're – in fact, actually, we've completed the bulk
of the share buyback program already. In fact, the only part of the transaction still to go is
the Association participation and that will be completed next week.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. That's very clear. Just one thing on UK, going back to the UK. So, is this the problem
mainly to do with the annuities business or are you facing that same issue with your other
pension business as well? Because what I want to understand is, given that you have sold
or reinsured large part of your annuities already, would that be a risk going forward or is it
pure – that's what I want to – is it purely related to annuities or other businesses like
pension or maybe a small with profit is also having a bit of impact?

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

It comes from three different sources. There is the annuities. That's true. There's also the
staff pension plan and then it is this second order impact that interest rates have on things
like risk margins and the other risks – for the that are remaining in the business. And it's
really a combination of those three.
I think on the annuities, the only thing I would add to what you said was to keep in mind
even though we've ensured €6 billion or about 60% of the annuities, we did lose the
transitional benefits on that first reinsurance tranche. So, in terms of the actual impact on
capital, there is still more to come as we look at the rest of the business that's there as
well as when we complete the Part VII transfer in roughly nine months' time or so.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

All right. This is very good. Thank you.

We take next question from Farooq Hanif from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is
open.

FINAL

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi, there. Thank you very much. Can you comment on what risks you see in remittance
from the Netherlands given where the ratio is? You plan to start remitting capital from the
Netherlands this year. And what would the timing of that be?
Secondly, you've had various acquisitions, disposals, reinsurance in the UK accounting
change. I mean, I don't know it's useful to cut it now or to cut it offline. But just think it'll be
useful to get a guide on what happens to earnings now? So, what's the BlackRock impact
minus the annuities, just in the round all of these impacts?
And my last question is on DOL, you've given a lot more information than some other
companies. It sounds like there's still some things in the air. What actual costs are you
going to incur now? And what kind of product changes, distribution changes are you
contemplating? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Hi, Farooq. Let me take the first two questions. On the NL remittances, yeah, all I can really
say here is we'll just continue to apply our capital policy. That's the best guidance I can
give you. Now, it is true that we're now find ourselves towards the lower end of our target
range instead of the upper end sitting at the 135% for the Netherlands. We do have some
more work to do to fine-tune our sensitivities, and we'll coming back to you with new
sensitivities for the Dutch business. That is also, in part, because we did change some of
our hedge programs around in the quarter. So, we're working on updating our
sensitivities. But, largely, what I would say is that we are focused on applying our capital
policy.
The only thing I would add to that is what I mentioned to Ashik is keep in mind it's not just
capital. It's not just about a point in time ratio. It's about a point in time ratio and the unwinded out ratio going forward. So, we do look at elements when the ratio is – and we've
highlighted the ratio under Solvency II. We'll have some volatility. It will float up and down.
But when you have the second order impacts that are going to unwind in the future, that's
different than having what I would say loss permanent capital.
So, we'll take a look at what the cash generation is under the fact that these second order
risks have moved against this. And we'll apply that against the new sensitivities, and we'll
basically apply our capital policy. So, that's the best guidance I can give you there.
On the UK, I think your question was more earnings-related. In terms of – so, we have
changed the – I think the most important thing is we did change the accounting policy as it
related to how we're handling the three different books of businesses and particularly the
DAC. The issue we were running into, if you remember, into last year was as we
upgraded policies from the old pension business up into the platform, we were having to

Page 8 of 24



Company N ame: Aegon N V
Company Ticker: AGN N A Equity
Date: 2016-05-12

write off the DAC on that upgrade. So, we went ahead and wrote a lot of that off on the
restated accounting policies in the fourth quarter of last year.

FINAL

So, what that does is that gets us to something that is much more of a, I would say,
sustainable earnings rate on kind of where we are now. There is an impact to earnings if
we continue to sell off – as we continue to sell off the annuity business. And that will bring
the run rate earnings down going forward.
I think we've given you some bogies on that, but we can follow-up with that offline. I think
the third question on DOL.

A - Alexander Rijn Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Farooq, indeed, you're right to point that we've tried to give you a bit more
guidance than others have. One of the reasons is that we've been very closely involved in
the whole process. We've been involved as a company but also as an industry. And the
outcome, in a sense, we believe now is more manageable than we could have had earlier.
And the reason is also that we have a longer transition period. And that means that
people have more time to adjust. And this is one of the things we were most concerned
about, that there would be a very short transition period and that would lead to a kind of
paralysis, if I can call that way, of our advisors and partners. So, the longer transition period
helps us.
We have actually started making our preparation for what we would expect the DOL rules
to be as already of late last year. So, we've been looking at our products. We've mainly
been looking at the way we sell our products going forward. So, let me take you now
through the three areas, which I think are the most relevant.
Number one is retirement plans. In fact, our business in the U.S. is a fiduciary-friendly
model with the open architecture. So, that essence – we will probably benefit, on a
relative basis, by the fact that our model has been not only focused in terms of how it's
positioned in the market, but also in terms how it's been very much focused in having a
very cost-efficient administration capability and does not require the added income from
the investment products. So that model actually is very well-positioned.
I also believe that it would lead potentially to a number of other players effectively come
to the conclusion they don't have the scale because it's now more and more clear that's
become a scale business and therefore acquisition of Mercer, very well fits in this and I
believe we'll see more of the opportunities to consolidate these type of assets on our
portfolio.
Now, in terms of the variable annuities, as you know, it's really the qualified part of the
market that's been impacted. It's difficult to say what we see and expect there. And we've
given you some guidance between 10% to 20% lower sales. And it is more to do with the
fact that we believe that our distribution partners will just – probably take the time to really
understand the rules, they will also have to take the time to comply to it.

Page 9 of 24



Company N ame: Aegon N V
Company Ticker: AGN N A Equity
Date: 2016-05-12

FINAL

On the other side, as we run our business, as you know, on a profitable basis, and we've
adjusted our pricing already, this happens at a point in time that we already have reduced
our market share in the market. And as a result of that, we don't expect – we therefore
expect that the impact is going to be lower.
And then finally, the third element, which by the way is also at the heart of our strategy, as
you know, pension money rollover means that we will have to adjust to that new reality.
And we believe, therefore, that our managed advice which I've talked about many times
already as being a way of helping our customers focusing on being prepared for
retirement. And then once they are more prepared for retirement, to take the actions
they need to be retired.
The death managed advice function is going to be more relevant now, in particular as we
do there through what we commonly call, I think, robo advice. But these are digitally
enabled capabilities that effectively allows us to collect with our 5 million plan participants
in the U.S. So, that strategy is going to support a direction.

Bloomberg Transcript

What I see happening here is probably longer retention. That means that customers will
stick to their assets in the 401(k) for a longer parts. But ultimately, they will also have to
make the choices to convert it in the form of income.
So, I hope I've been able to give you a bit more color. And also how this whole rules fit in
our strategy. And I think the final point I need to say is that it's obvious that this will require
work, adjusting our sales, adjusting our distributors and increase compliance cost, which
we hope to be able and effectively absorb over a period of time. But, we started out
effectively – are being ready for it last year.

Our next question comes from Nadine van der Meulen from Morgan Stanley. Please go
ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Nadine van der Meulen

{BIO 15200446 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning, everyone. The holdco cash buffer, I believe, is around €1 billion. Can
you give an indication of what the excess capital is in the U.S. over the AA requirement?
So, that's the first question.
And the other question I had was, at the Investor Day, you guided to excess cash
generation, I believe, it was around €600 million over a three-year time period. It was
based on the €1 billion free cash generation expected over the year – over atypical year.
The run rate that you show now this quarter, I suppose, is 0.2%. So, that's a bit lower. Can
you comment on that expectation going forward? And I suppose that links in with Farooq's
question around the €250 million that can be up-streamed out of the Netherlands.
Page 10 of 24



Company N ame: Aegon N V
Company Ticker: AGN N A Equity

And then, the last question I had was with regard to the yield assumption at the current
4.25% yield assumption that you have. Currently, the tenure is at 1.7%. What's the risk of
lowering the assumption and is taking it quite a big DPAC charge on that? That's it. Thank
you.

FINAL

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Okay. Nadine, I'll try to take those questions in order. On the U.S. capital, we're not
disclosing the – some PAA excess anymore. We've moved over to RBC ratios as our
primary capital metric in the U.S., and I think that fits better into how it comes across into
the group Solvency II ratio. So, what I can tell you is actually RBC ratios are up a little from
last quarter. We're at €480 million, and that's up from €460 million, €465 million, I think it
was last quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the excess cash generation actually we're very much in line with the targets that we've
set out before, I think you've quoted the €200 million being down from the €300 million,
actually that's a free cash flow number, so that's after holding cost. So if you took that
back to operational free cash flows that's the €300 million that we show on the opening
in the presentation. That's very much in line obviously that's shown to one decimal point
on a billions but that's very much in line with the €325 million expectation that we would
get which is the €1.3 billion that we're expecting for 2016. So, I would say we're still very
much ion track there certainly on a normalize cash generation basis.
Your third question was on the 4.25% long-term interest rate assumption in the U.S. I don't
really see that a lot of risk in that assumption to be honest with you. It is a tenure
assumption. So we rate their uniformly from the current curve to that number over 10
years. So, we start out at the 1.75% that we are now. We get their linearly over the next 10
years, I think that's a reasonable assumption and it's certainly in line with the market
practice.

Good morning, gentlemen. Just one question from me. Actually, most of them actually
been already dealt with. Just going back to the operational free cash flow in the quarter,
you're reporting that as a kind of rounded €0.3 billion. I just wondered if you could actually
just helped me quantify that in millions as in previous quarters. Probably because actually if

I look at slide six, I think if I took that number of 2 percentage points, which I presume is
post the holding cost, so I'm looking at probably something more like €250 million. So any
– just a little bit more detail would be helpful there. Thanks.

mean, these are balance sheet moves quarter-to-quarter. So, we think kind of a rounded
approach is a better way to look at it. But the short answer behind that is actually around
€325 million. That's about where we came in on the first quarter. So, that is the more
detailed number. But again, plus or minus €25 million, €30 million on that kind of roll
forward is an easy swing factor, if you will. But we are, this quarter, in around the €325
million.

We take the next question from Gordon Aitken from RBC. Please go ahead. Your line is
open.

Q - Gordon Aitken

{BIO 3846728 <GO>}

Yeah. Good morning. Thank you. First question on – if you could talk about your Dutch DB
experience in the first quarter. So, what – I mean, how many schemes are sort of up for
renewal? How many are sort of continuing to go down the DB route for future accrual?
How many are – and I know you're trying to shift to future quota hybrid or DC What was
the experience there? Are you losing any to competitors just because they just won't take
your prices? So, that's the first question.
Second one on the UK and the BlackRock deal. Just talk a bit about the revenue bits and
the cost bits as it is at the moment. I mean – and if you won't tell me the your numbers,
you can tell me is it currently profitable, that book? And I'm assuming that there's a big
chunk of that, which is invested in BlackRock tracker funds and maybe what percentage
that is. And what's your target? Presumably, the goal here is to increase the
proportionates in your own asset management product. So, that's the second question.
And the third question, on the U.S., on the DOL, you said – I think in this presentation, you
said no meaningful impact in the tax structure no impact on the back book. I mean, how
can you be so sure that advisors won't revisit and maybe even some recent sales? Thank
you.

FINAL

Good. Well, let me take the questions on the pension business announced. As you know,
interest rates do play an important role here. At this point in time, there is very limited
movement in the DB schemes, and we'll see. Increasingly, customers are looking for
opportunities to move from DB to DC.
So, the DB environment now is effectively more or less inactive. And that's also one of the
reasons that you will see that not only have we been building up our PPIs or 401(k) or type
or defined contribution capability, but we're also going to launch our APF, the new vehicle
that is, what we believe, going to be a very good alternative for DB plans looking for a
new home.
And we are about to launch it. I think we're waiting for the final approvals where we
needed to. It's good to know, and I can share this with you because I'm pleased to be
able to do so, we've already €2.2 billion of commitments into that new APF vehicle, which
we believe is going to be the kind of alternative to the traditional DB schemes because
effectively, it's something of a scheme which is a bit of both, DB and DC, but allows a
transition that is a bit smoother than moving from DB to DC.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, this way, you will see the focus of us as a leading provider pension, the leading
provider of pensions in Netherlands. We are very well positioned. We are also
consolidating our platform. So, when we had two PPIs, we're putting them together on
one platform which allows us to be able to be very effective in terms of expenses.
Let me just try to answer your question on our statement that we made on the back book
that we do not believe that our back book was really going to be impacted. Well, what we
see is most likely is going to happen is more like paralysis from advisers where they will,
first of all, have to assess what the new position is, go back to the customers. And that
means that we'll see rather less activity than we see more activity and that is the reason
why we believe also that our back book as such is not going to be very much impacted.
The rules, by the way, going forward, is really about the fiduciary rule looking at sales
going forward from the pension area.

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Yeah. And on the third question on BlackRock, Gordon, maybe let me just – I'll just go right
to bottom line question you're asking. Is it profitable day one? The answer is no. It's kind
of a breakeven sort of proposition on day one. The opportunities are for us to then bring
it in, merge your business together and take out some of the cost base. There's also
some strategic elements of this in terms of giving us access to some propositions that we
did not have before. So, on day one, it doesn't really move the numbers, but what it does
is gives us an opportunity going forward.

Just to put this into context of the U.S. and DOL, as we said earlier, the fact that we have
done this Mercer acquisition which is very, by the way, very similar to what we're now
doing with BlackRock already generated close to €2 billion of sales in the first quarter and
this because it brings in new capability identical to what we just – Darryl just said on
BlackRock to our U.S. business because in the U.S. we were mostly involved in the smaller
and the SME schemes and now with the Mercer capability are also able to cover the whole
market and cover the very big schemes which bring us a lot of new plan participants and
that's at the heart of a strategy, not so much of focus on the schemes in itself but is to
focus on the plan participants individually needing to find solutions for their retirement.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Hello. Thank you very much. Good morning. First of all, that slide seven where you talk
about reviewing the IFRS curve in the third quarter. Can you just clarify presumably that is
when do you move it to the Solvency II curve or not? So, it's binary. I'm afraid I'm no good
on the math on this, I mean if you were to move to the Solvency II curve, what exactly
would be – well directionally, what would be the impact, given there's a change in the
shape of the curve. I'm not even sure about the directional impacts, positive or negative?
And the secondly, the U.S. dividends, I think that slated to be a billion dollars for this year
as a round number. How should I be thinking about that second quarter versus first
quarter? I'm basically assuming 50/50 but obviously, fourth quarter was low last year
because you didn't need the cash. So I'm not sure about whether it's reasonable to
assume 50/50 or if there could be some skew?
And then finally, I hope, briefly, given the point you were making about the weakness of
VAs because of daily averaging. Presumably, it's the statement of the obvious with the
second quarter should be stronger as a result of that, if you could just confirm?
And if we were sort of starting at the – where the markets have been in the first month,
what would be the natural bounce back of moving from the daily average to what we
really the out-quarter (39:14), in the quarter? Thank you.

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Hi, Will. It's Darryl. I'll try and answer your questions. The first one, IFRS, yes, you're correct
on the binary decision. We're looking at – I guess it doesn't have to be binary. It could be
any other curve, but what we're analyzing and looking to move is the IFRS curve much
closer to, if not on top, of the Solvency II curve. And, really, that will – for, really, the sole
purpose of trying to take our IFRS volatility down so that we get a matching of our IFRS
Page 14 of 24



Company N ame: Aegon N V
Company Ticker: AGN N A Equity
Date: 2016-05-12

results with actual hedge programs that are in place which are there to protect Solvency II
basis, so, yes, it's IFRS to Solvency II.

FINAL

What will that do? I guess, generally, that will lead to a positive in doing that curve change,
but that's something that we haven't quantified in size and that's something that we're
analyzing now. So, I can give you a directional component only on that one at this point.
U.S. dividends, yes, 50/50 is a good expectation and the $1 billion dividend for the year,
50/50, first half/second half, is a good number to work with.
And then, finally, on the daily averaging, yes, your math is right. We ended the quarter
higher, and so we enter into Q2 with higher balances as long as we don't have a similar
sort of dip effect. We will, at least, earn back the earnings drag that came from the
decline, if you will, throughout the quarter. That's going to be – it varies by product line.
Most of the dip was on the variable annuities, also some on the pension and the mutual
fund in the business. In total, be around €20 million or so would be a high level number I
would put on that.

We take the next question from Mark Cathcart from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line
is open.

Q - Mark David Cathcart

{BIO 19783252 <GO>}

Yeah. Hi. It's Mark Cathcart from Jefferies. I've got three questions for Darryl. The first one
is if at the January Investor Day you would have been presented with the financial market
evolution that then happened between that date and March 31, would you have been
able to predict the Dutch Solvency ratio of 135% or would it have been better than that on
your analysis, what you know at that stage relying (41:43) on your sensitivities?
The second question is, a year ago I think you commented on this conference call that you
are positive or you thought there was going to be a benign outcome for Q3 modeling
charges. And obviously, it wasn't benign. Would you say you're more or less confident
than you were at the first quarter last year on the outcome for Q3 this year?
And then, the third question is you operate in 25 countries. If we knock that down to 22,
so we knock off the UK, the U.S. and the Netherlands, of those 22 countries, how many
are you actually generating cost of capital? Thank you.

your cost of capital or above in those 22 countries?

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. Let me go back to the first question. In terms of the Dutch capital
position, how much of this -

Q - Mark David Cathcart

{BIO 19783252 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

You mentioned about singularity was difficult, I think. So, as your comment, the singularity
was difficult, so I'm just trying to work out if you knew what the outcome was going to be?

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Yeah. I think and – of course, in January, we never know where the Dutch mortgage
spreads are going to end. And some of the cross impacts you get into. So, the Dutch
mortgage spreads are wider. And I would say we're about to -

Q - Mark David Cathcart

{BIO 19783252 <GO>}

No. Sorry, Darryl. The question is if you'd have known what was going to happen in the
first quarter would you have come out with that number of €135 million? In other words,
given what happens, was the €135 million predictable? That's what I'm trying to get to?

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Yeah. I guess it's a difficult question to answer. I think largely if I knew everything that in
know now in hindsight could I have gotten to the right number. I think the answer to that
question is yes. I'm trying to -

Q - Mark David Cathcart

{BIO 19783252 <GO>}

So, your sensitivity is performed as you expected them to?

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Page 16 of 24



Company N ame: Aegon N V
Company Ticker: AGN N A Equity
Date: 2016-05-12

FINAL

Yeah. I will say we are updating the sensitivities for some of the hedge program changes
that were made throughout the quarter. So, we are going to and I am flagging here that
the Dutch interest rate sensitivity will be higher than what we have on those sensitivities.
And that I think is clearly laid out in the presentation.
I think there are impacts to the capital ratio that you cannot capture in the sensitivities
themselves. So, when you get into some of the credit downgrades and migration, those
aren't easily captured in the sensitivities that we provided. Where I was going, when I
started to answer the question was that dropping of interest rates has an impact on
mortgage spreads if the consumer rates don't follow because of our methodology that
we've landed on and how we compute the fair value of the Dutch mortgage. So, there's
cross-term impacts there.
So, there are a lot of cross-term impacts that is difficult to put on a single page of
sensitivities which is what we shared you in January. So, I mean the broad answer is, yes, in
perfect hindsight, we would have got to the same number. But is all of that captured on
the sensitivities that you have on a single page. No, because there are some cross-term
elements that have gone against so there's basis risk that's gone against us in this
quarter. So that's – I don't know if that's answering your question or not, Mark, but I think -

Q - Mark David Cathcart

{BIO 19783252 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I'm just trying to get a handle on how much in control you are of your Solvency II rate for
the Netherlands. And what you're suggesting is cross-term impact or something that
you're not really too sure how they're going to evolve, so you're not quite in control of
your Solvency II ratio outcome from the Netherlands?

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Well, it is a complicated calculation, I can tell you that. And that there's a reason I'm not
giving you sensitivities here today is that we do have quite a bit of work to do to do
modeling on the SCR and all of those cross term impacts.

Q - Mark David Cathcart

{BIO 19783252 <GO>}

So, if your Solvency II ratio did go below 135% by, say, the end of Q3 as of 128% or 132%,
would you still upstream that €250 million of cash? I presume not.

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Yeah. So, I'll go back to the question that I answered earlier. It really is applying our capital
policy. But because our sensitivities have gone higher, we have to go back and relook at
that capital policy. But we're currently in the green zone of our capital policy. But I've also
flagged that we need to go back and look at sensitivities to make sure that the capital
ranges in zones that we've identified for the Dutch business still fit within the capital ratio.
So, the capital policy is laid out to give, hopefully, certainly internally from a governance
perspective, but also externally, a good understanding of where we are from our ability to
upstream dividends. So, we are towards the bottom end of that range, and the
Page 17 of 24



Company N ame: Aegon N V
Company Ticker: AGN N A Equity
Date: 2016-05-12

sensitivities are increasing. So, that's the part that we have to go back and analyze. So, I
can't give you a definitive answer on the NL dividend for this year until we go back and
complete that work.

Q - Mark David Cathcart

{BIO 19783252 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Thanks. Well, that's the first question.

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Your other question on assumption you've reviewed for Q3, yeah, again, as I sit here in
the first quarter, I'm not anticipating anything coming out of the third quarter. Assumption
review in the last two years, we have dealt with a mortality issue in terms of bringing in a
new mortality curve in the U.S. to deal with older age mortality. The good news is, I think,
here in the first quarter actually mortality exceeded our expectations. We were off our
annual run rate, but not as far as what we would normally expect because of the
seasonality effect. So, while we might normally expect about a €30 million deterioration,
we only saw €14 million in the first quarter as an example. So, I think, the mortality is
tracking okay.

Bloomberg Transcript

In terms of the assumption reviews that we had, we also had an update to the universal
life persistency assumption as last year. We've completed that work and there's nothing
else that I'm anticipating for the third quarter but, of course, I can't give you definitive
assurance, otherwise, we'll go through our normal actuarial process of reviewing all of our
assumptions and that will be – that's activity that started now and we'll carry on into the
summer and we will announce it in the quarter.
The last question, I don't have an exact number on the €20 million – I have to go back and
add up whether the €22 million was right or not. But -

Q - Mark David Cathcart

{BIO 19783252 <GO>}

The reason I asked that question is because the new way that you're showing your
numbers – which is now done on a continental basis. So, it's U.S., Europe, Asia suggests
that you're seeing yourself as a global company rather than a U.S., Dutch, small UK
company and I'm just wondering how on top you are in terms of the delivery of all of
these countries in which you operate and that's the reason for the question.

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

And some of the answer lies in the maturity of these underlying businesses as well. So, if
you start in the Central Eastern European region, the majority of those countries are in
fact, returning good returns, dividend paying to the group, and hitting our cost to capital. I
think Turkey would be an exception to that but also is one of our newer faster growing
region. So, we see that as an investment for growth for the future and the rest of them
are more mature in developing and returning profits.
Spain has been a turnaround story for us as we have changed out the distribution and
entered into the new relationship with Santander and that's a – so that's a different
Page 18 of 24

Date: 2016-05-12

FINAL

recovery, and we're very much on track for developing or delivering on our business plans
there.
When you get into the joint ventures across Asia, the story is a little bit mixed. The most
mature of those businesses is the high net worth business which was an ex-Transamerica
business. That's profitable and hitting our returns. The newer JVs in China, India, Japan,
for instance, are not hitting our returns and not hitting our return on capitals. So, there is a
mix story, but for very good reasons across each of those different geographies.

Q - Mark David Cathcart

{BIO 19783252 <GO>}

I'm sure the reasons are good, but other companies have put it from noncore periphery
operations and just wonder if Aegon might go down that path.

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

I guess maybe I could – the only thing I would add to that is something we evaluate on all
our businesses at all times. And when we do go in a different direction, then we will let
you know.

We take next question from Matthias de Wit from KBC Securities. Please go ahead. Your
line is open.

Q - Matthias de Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. Three small questions, please. First on the Dutch capital position, just
wonder whether there's anything you could do to optimize the ratio. In the past, you
concluded a number of longevity swaps but, to my understanding, you did not yet get any
capital credit for them. So, is it still something you would expect and is there anything else
you could do to optimize or boost the ratio going forward? So, that's the first question.
Secondly, on the DOL, you guided for an impact on VA sales and higher implementation
expenses. Is there anything – is there any offset from cost savings? And could you maybe
share whether you see any negative impacts on earnings and also comment on the timing
of any such impacts?
And then the last question is on the U.S. capital position. Is there anything you could share
on how much of the quarter-on-quarter increase in RBC was driven by the drop in interest
rates because to me that looks like a non-economic gain to the capital position. And just
wonder how much of that you could remit to the holdco in the form of dividends going
forward? Thank you.

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah, Matthias. I'll take the first and the third. On the NL capital ratio, is there more we can
do? Yeah, there is and we continue to look at that. So, we continue to look at laying
longevity off into the market that we've been clear about that from a strategic objective
as well as capital optimization. So, that's something that you will continue to see us deliver
on as we go forward.
And then on the U.S. capital position, on the RBC ratio, I don't have the exact number on
how much it was benefited from the interest rates. There was some modest uptick
because what happens in the U.S. is the derivatives that we have to protect against low
interest rates generate statutory earnings in the U.S. That has sort of a positive inflation to
the ratio.
But in terms of the contribution into the dividends, the reality is we are really in a strong
excess capital position in the U.S. and definitely in dividend paying mode. So, even despite
that uptick, which is sort of non-economic as you say, which is probably a fair statement, it
doesn't change the dividend outlook from the U.S. given where our capital ratios are and
where our cash generation out of the U.S. is coming from.
The DOL?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alexander Rijn Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

On the DOL, Matthias, I just would like to add that the implementation is for certain parts
of the rule April 2017; and other parts of the rule, the end of 2017. So, that gives us quite
some transition, which I've referred to earlier.
Now, in terms of expenses, additional – not expenses, the only answer I want to give you
is that we have made a clear commitment to reduce expense by €150 million by 2018,
and we stick to that.

Q - Matthias de Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

Okay. That's very clear. If I could just come back on the Dutch capital position, on longevity
swaps, for example, do you have any idea when we could expect any news on – in terms
of capital credit you might get or – and what other discussions you're currently having with
the DNB in that regard?

A - Darryl D. Button

{BIO 7089946 <GO>}

Yeah. It's actually a two-part answer, and thanks for the question. We are still working with
the Dutch Central Bank to get internal model approval for our longevity risk-based capital.
That was sort of one of the day two items that we put on the list of this year. So, there still
are some opportunities that we have in terms of expanding scope of our internal model.
We had de-scoped it last year just because of all the work in the time line. So, there are
still some scope expansions to our internal model that we're working on for this year. That
will allow us to take credit for some of the longevity transactions that we've already done,
that we haven't got full credit for.

And then, in terms of more deals, in terms of laying off longevity into the market, that's
something we're currently working on now. And I would expect – I can't give you an exact
time line, but somewhere in the next two to three quarters, you'll probably see something
else from us transaction-wise.

Our next question comes from Bart Horsten from Kempen & Co. Please go ahead. Your
line is open.

Q - Bart Horsten

{BIO 2390919 <GO>}

Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. First of all, on the Dutch capital
position, an add-on question. Do you exclude the possibility that you may have to do a
capital injection for your Dutch life activities?

Bloomberg Transcript

My second question regards to your holding cash position. Could you remind me on the
target level you have there? And in the press release, you also said that there was a
capital contribution to the operations of €100 million. Could you tell us which activity is that
related to? And will the holding cash position, going forward also still be impacted, for
instance, by purchase price you paid for the BlackRock activities?
And my final question is on the alternative investment portfolio where you mentioned a
write-down. And could you tell us the size of that portfolio and what we can expect going
forward in that portfolio? Thank you.

A - Alexander Rijn Wynaendts

{BIO 1821092 <GO>}

Hi, Bart. This is Darryl. Let me try to hit those questions. The way I would answer your NL
capital injection question is the way I answered the dividend question earlier, which is we'll
apply our capital policy in the Netherlands. We're still in the green zone of our €130 million
to €150 million target zone for our subsidiary levels, albeit at the lower end now. We do
have some work to go back and check our sensitivities and make sure that those are the
appropriate ranges for us to continue to run in. But at this point, I'm certainly not
foreseeing any capital injection into the Netherlands business. So, I guess I would just say
it that way.
On your second question, if I captured it all correctly, it was holding-related. We do target
€1 billion to €1.5 billion. That's our stated target for excess capital in the holding. We're at
€1 billion now.
In terms of the movement in the quarter, there was about €100 million total, a little less
than that that went into units. They were really small increments that went in, in several
different places to a couple of our joint ventures in Asia, and a small amount into our unit

Page 21 of 24



Company N ame: Aegon N V
Company Ticker: AGN N A Equity
Date: 2016-05-12

in Spain for our expansion into Portugal, and a little bit into Ireland were we are selling the
guarantee product, the guarantee VA product. So, it was a little bit across four different
regions which added up, I think, to a total of about €80 million, rounded to the €100
million on the slide.

FINAL

And then BlackRock, there really is no purchase price associated with BlackRock. So, there
was no impact on the holding excess cash from the BlackRock transaction.
Your last question was on the alternative portfolio. The alternative portfolio in the U.S. is
about €2.4 billion, of which about €1.8 billion or so is currently in hedge funds. The rest is in
private equity and real estate alternatives. We are targeting to reduce the hedge fund
component over time and transition more into private equity and other alternatives. So, I
think the €2.4 billion will stay, but €1.8 billion of hedge funds will come down over time and
be replaced.

Nick, as I've said, I don't believe that we'll see a boost into USA. You're probably referring
to kind of the fire sales before the – the rules change. I believe, on the contrary, most
people would just wait. I see more something like paralysis in how advisors are you going
to behave. They certainly would not want to take an action that then can be seen as not
being in line to the implemented the rule. So, I'm certainly not seeing that.

On the second question, how do we feel about flat equity markets on the VA portfolio. I
mean, I think we feel quite okay. I mean, the reality is we have hedge program in place.
We have really 100% of the equity delta exposure hedged on all of our VA business. And
so, from a guarantee risk perspective, we're really agnostic to movements in equity
markets as it relates to the VA business from sort of a – we are – we do have some
revenue at risk if you will in terms of a and you saw some signs of that this quarter as the
equity markets went up and down, you have a little bit of more that mutual fund revenue
that fluctuates but in scenario you described as a flat equity market but that wouldn't be
an issue in that scenario. So, I don't really see it as an issue.
In terms of the net amount at risk, we – the total net amount at risk for the book is around
€3.8 billion. So, I think I agree with your comments that's not a – certainly not the largest
that's out there.
