FINAL

Thank you, Giulia. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the presentation of
Generali's first half results 2020.
Before we open the floor for questions, let me highlight our four key messages. First, the
results we present today confirm that Generali is resilient, both from a financial and
operating standpoint and that we are able to withstand the unprecedented challenge
posed by COVID-19. Our operating result at EUR2.7 billion was in-line with that of the first
half of the year 2019, when we achieved a record high figure. We confirmed once again
our technical excellence with a combined ratio at 89.5% and a new business margin at
3.94%. And our solid position from a capital perspective with the solvency ratio at 194%.
Second, at Generali we promptly reacted to the COVID situation, acting like true Lifetime
Partner to all our customers, our agents and all stakeholders. We put in place many
initiatives to support them at this critical juncture and we implemented a number of
business actions that helped to mitigate the effects of the crisis.

Bloomberg Transcript

Third, we confirm our outlook for the remainder of the year, whilst being conscious of the
persisting uncertainty about the socio-economic and financial consequences of the
COVID-19 pandemic. We expect our operating result to be resilient this year, thanks to
favorable business mix and a robust standard policy terms, albeit with likely decrease
compared to 2019.
Fourth, we continue to execute our strategy. Our Generali 2021 strategy, we executed it in
a disciplined way, while accelerating on some initiatives such as digital transformation and
adapting to the changing scenario. At the same time, we are ready to capture any
opportunities any good opportunities that might arise, and we will provide a full update on
the progress on our strategic plan on our Investor Day which will be held virtually, of
course, on November 18th.
Thank you very much for your time, for your attention. And together with Frederic and
Cristiano, we will be happy to answer your questions. Thank you.

Questions And Answers

(Question And Answer)
(Operator Instructions) The first question is from Andrew Sinclair with Bank of America.
Please go ahead.

Q - Andrew Sinclair

{BIO 17749036 <GO>}

Thanks and good afternoon, everyone. Three for me, if that's okay. Firstly was on
Switzerland where you've taken some reserve strengthening but it sounds like there
might still be quite a lot to come with a similar in H2, and you said negative operating
result for 2021.
Page 2 of 23



Company N ame: Assicuraz ioni Generali SpA
Company Ticker: G I M Equity
Date: 2020-07-30

Just wondering if you could give us a bit more color on this, and why you not take the
whole hit upfront? And finally, when do we think we will get back to profitability for
Switzerland? So that's the first question.

FINAL

Second question is on M&A. You've got a stake in Cattolica. You've been linked with Borsa
Italiana, neither of which really seems naturally set into your core M&A focus. Could you
give us a bit more color on these and what we should think about the M&A strategy?
And then thirdly was just on P&C claims frequency. I just really wondered if you could give
a bit of color on how things have changed since lockdowns started to ease. Do you still
see COVID as being fairly neutral to maybe even slightly positive for the P&C business in
H2? Thanks.

A - Giulia Raffo

{BIO 21037091 <GO>}

Andy, sorry, can I ask you a favor? Can you repeat, please, the first question?

Q - Andrew Sinclair

{BIO 17749036 <GO>}

The first one on Switzerland?

A - Giulia Raffo

{BIO 21037091 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, sorry.

Q - Andrew Sinclair

{BIO 17749036 <GO>}

Sure. Just saying, on Switzerland, you've had the reserve strengthening. But it sounds like
a similar hit to come in H2. You've guided for negative operating results in 2021. Just really
wondered if you could give us a bit more color on that. And when profitability might return
for Switzerland, then actually, could you not just take that whole hit up front rather than
spreading that over a couple of years?

A - Giulia Raffo

{BIO 21037091 <GO>}

Thank you. I suggest we start with Philippe on the M&A strategy. And then Frdric, if you
want to answer the question on Switzerland. Thank you. And then P&C also. Yes, thank
you.

A - Philippe Donnet

{BIO 4657671 <GO>}

Thank you, Andrew. On the M&A strategy, there is no change on the strategy we
described when we presented our Generali 2021 strategy.
So, it's a very disciplined strategy on the insurance. It's focused on Europe. The scope is
wider on the asset management side. We have nothing serious, except the Cattolica
investment, which is strategic and industrial investment. On Borsa Italiana, there is
absolutely nothing. We are not involved in this. So, basically, this is it. Frederic?

FINAL

A - Frederic Marie de Courtois D'Arcollieres
So I'll start quickly with the P&C frequency before moving to the first one. So, on
frequencies, yes, we've seen dramatic decreases of frequency during the lockdown,
especially on motors by more than 50%. But we've also seen decreases in some other
lines of business. What is interesting is that even if frequencies have increased after the
significant increase after the lockdown, they've not come back yet to normal levels, which
I think is a good indicator also of the economic recovery. So we still have frequencies
which are down compared to our normal levels.
On the first question on Switzerland. So first, this is important to understand where it
comes from. So it comes from an acceleration of the reserve strengthening which relates
to an old Unit Linked portfolio in run-off, which was close to new business around 10 years
ago.

Bloomberg Transcript

But the size of this portfolio is around CHF8 billion, and this portfolio has financial
guarantees. The average guarantee on the book is at around 2.3% and these are at
maturity guarantees. So, the book is partially hedged for interest rate and equity market
moves. But as you may have seen, interest rates have decreased a lot recently in all
countries and also in Switzerland. And due to this extremely low level and due to the fact
that we want to have a prudent reserving approach, we've decided to accelerate what we
had started to do about 10 years ago. So about 10 years ago in accordance with the Swiss
regulators, we had decided to set up a guarantee reserve linked to this portfolio.
At the end of 2019, this reserve had reached an amount of CHF1.3 billion. And again,
linked to the context, we decided to accelerate this reserving in 2020. So we've booked
CHF300 million in the first half, and we will book to the same amount in the second half.
After that, we will come back, I would say, to normal levels of reserving. So, I understand
your questions on why don't we do it one-off as it is linked to, first, this is linked to the way
the Swiss regulator -- the agreement with the Swiss regulator and how the Swiss regulator
decides that we should book this. And then you should have in mind that this is a very
long-term portfolio, about 30 years maturities. And the agreement with the regulator is
that we will continue to increase reserves over the next 7 years. But, again, at -- we will
come back to a normal pace of reserving.
In addition, you may have seen that, again, with the same philosophy, to be cautious. We
decided to impair the goodwill on our Swiss portfolio and on our Swiss operation, and it
had a EUR93 million impact at half year.
I think -- and I will conclude with this. I think it is important to understand that the Swiss
portfolio against this run-off portfolio has very high technical profits and very high fees. So
of course, we have negative investment margins, but we have partially compensating
fees there, high technical margins and very high fees.
So, what I can tell you is that at current market conditions, we estimate that the value of
the portfolio is negative in the region of mid triple-digit EUR100 million euro. I hope I was
clear, Andrew.

FINAL

The next question is from Peter Eliot with Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Great. Thank you very much. Two questions from my side. And I might comeback quickly
on Switzerland. But first of all, on your expense ratio, you showed a big reduction of 0.7
percentage points. Would you be able to comment how much of that you think is
structural and how much of it is simply a sort of short-term volume and mix effect that
might reverse in due course?
The second question, I noticed your Italian motor premiums were down 7%. I was
wondering if you could just outline the drivers of that and maybe put it in the context of
what you see has happened to the whole market as well.

Bloomberg Transcript

And then yes, finally, maybe just to come back quickly on Switzerland. I was just wondering
if you could out -- I mean, obviously, you mentioned the lower interest rates, which are, I
guess, the primary driver. But I'm just wondering if you could just highlight sort of what the
further risks are for that. And whether -- sorry, just to clarify, whether from 2022, you di
expect to be back on the sort of the old run rate for operating profit going forward?
Thank you very much.

A - Giulia Raffo

{BIO 21037091 <GO>}

Hi, Peter. Thank you very much. I think Frederic might want to take the expense ratio
question and the motor and Switzerland, sorry. All for you.

A - Frederic Marie de Courtois D'Arcollieres
Hi, Peter. So, on expense ratio, you are right that there was a strong decrease of
expenses this year, which is linked to, I would say, of course, directly to the COVID impact,
which is also linked to additional discipline. Again, in tough times, we have additional
discipline.
So it's difficult to say what is run rate and what is one-off. As a high-level order of
magnitude, I would say probably around 50-50. But what is important is that all of this
made us aware that we have other margins to decrease expenses and we will continue to
decrease expenses even next year, beyond what we had in mind in our plan. So, we've -we're working on this. And again, this is linked to the experience of the past few months.
On the motor premium development, I understand that your question was linked to Italy
only. So yes, there was a quite significant decrease of premiums, of motor premiums in
Italy. Part of this is linked to postponement of renewals. So, we will see that and we'll see
by end of September, we will see a recovery over the coming months.
Page 5 of 23



Company N ame: Assicuraz ioni Generali SpA
Company Ticker: G I M Equity
Date: 2020-07-30

Still, I expect the premium evolution figure on motor to remain negative. And this is linked
to both a more difficult new business and to the fact that in the current circumstances, we
support our clients. And as frequencies have decreased a lot, our clients are also
benefiting from this, and we see a decrease on the average premium.

FINAL

I understand your third question was linked to Switzerland, but can you be more -- can you
say it again Peter on what exactly was your question, the third question?

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Yes. So, I just wanted to sort of understand the risks to the guidance that you've given. I
mean I'm assuming a further fall in interest rates would mean that maybe you have to
take a sort of slightly bigger short-term hit, and just sort of confirm or understand that as
you see it at the moment, as it currently stands, that from 2022, we should be back to
sort of normal operating level that we've seen in the past.

A - Frederic Marie de Courtois D'Arcollieres
So it is clear that this Swiss portfolio is sensitive to the Swiss interest rate level. We've
adopted for the -- for 2020, a cautious approach. But if we had a significant increase of,
again, of Swiss interest rates, it would have a negative impact.

Bloomberg Transcript

Again, based on the today's scenario, as I've said before, we expect that after the strong
effort that we've made this year, we will come back to normal level of reserving in
Switzerland. We will continue to allocate to the guarantee reserve as we've done over the
past years.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you very much. So, just quickly to clarify, if I can, I think you said an increase in
interest rates, would mean higher reserving. I assume that you meant the other way
around --

A - Philippe Donnet

{BIO 4657671 <GO>}

I'm sorry. If I said this, I must be tired. That's obviously decrease in interest rate levels.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Imagined it. Just checking. Imagined it.

A - Giulia Raffo

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Hello. Hi, there. Thanks. Just some very quick questions, I think. In the Life business, I
noticed it was only really Switzerland and Spain I think that where you had the declines in
net investment margin. There was a lot of resilience in Italy, Germany, France in particular.
Do we expect more pressure there in second half or going forward, I mean, particularly
because you've already flagged, we're going to see lower real estate rents? Obviously,
lower dividends must have already come through I suppose. But maybe just clarify, is that
resilience in the investment spread in those countries not to be extrapolated? Or is it?
Linked to that, maybe just update us broadly on what you're doing with your sort of
reinvestment strategy in current markets. I've seen that you've obviously flagged very low
reinvestment rates. I don't know what you can do to supplement those. Maybe just give us
an overview as to how you're treating the problem of reinvestment right now, which has
clearly got even more challenging.
And the final question, I should probably know the answer to this. This is a very quick one.
I'm a bit confused. Asset management result was up a lot quarterly as in Q2 versus Q1,
even though average AUM must have been down, at least for external clients, but is there
some seasonality in the asset management result? And I think there is. But just remind us
why that is. Thanks.

A - Giulia Raffo

{BIO 21037091 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you. Cristiano, if you can take the first question, and then we can pass on to Tim for
the two question on reinvestment and asset management. Thank you.

A - Cristiano Borean

{BIO 15246531 <GO>}

Yes. Thanks a lot, Andrew. So first point on the net investment margin in the second half, if
I have to compare what is the expected net of extraordinary development of the market,
which is still unknown in front of us, should be quite fairly similar to the first half of the
2020, due to the actions and due to also the equilibrium in the investment part we
managed through this quite low yield environment.

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

There's no effect from lower real estate rents to come through still?

A - Cristiano Borean

{BIO 15246531 <GO>}

From real estate, you will see potentially a slightly higher part in the second half of the
year, notwithstanding the fact that this is counterbalanced by the fact that in the first half,
you were missing the dividend from the banks. So you need just to make the balance
among the two. That's why I'm saying it is fairly stable.

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay.

Tim?

FINAL

A - Tim Ryan

{BIO 21076682 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon, Andrew. This is Tim Ryan, the Group CIO. So, on your second
question on reinvestment strategy, the first point I want to mention is, we are very
cautious on the way we deployed capital. You will have seen that even our cash position
has increased. Why? Because we always want to look at the risk adjusted return.
What do we do to do this? We have done a couple of key elements. One is to continue to
selectively invest in investment grade with high-quality names, and this has been very
efficient. Our team has done a wonderful job on this, first point.

Bloomberg Transcript

The second is to continue, as we said before, because our strategy is to be resilient
whatever the market situation is in real assets. And on real assets, we have seen some
quite big dislocation both on the private equity side as well as on the private debt side.
And this is all across the different geographies. And for us, this is for an opportunity to
even accelerate the deployment. But again, being very cautious on risk and liquidity, which
is a key element. So, this is to answer your second question.
The third element, I will answer as well on the asset management side. We have said that
our projection to deliver EUR350 million by 2021 would be quite linear, but there is some
seasonality that comes from the second point I mentioned just on your question, is that
we deploy on the real asset. We do have commitments. We do have fees that are
captured at different point of time. There is a seasonality. That is usually the second
quarter as well as the last quarter of the year, we have a bit of a pickup on the fees. So
this is to understand this.
But at the end, why we've been resisting fairly well is that asset mix that is not just thirdparty, but the asset mix we have is today a majority of fixed income products. And
obviously with the yield compression on government bond, this has been helped -enabled us to also benefit from bit of a market uptick on the -- on our fixed income
portfolio, which, therefore gets more fees.

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Thanks for that. Just to clarify, the reinvestment rates that are cited, I think, is 1.3% in both
Life and non-Life, I think. Is that the average for the half year? Or is that the kind of spot
position?

A - Tim Ryan

{BIO 21076682 <GO>}

The average -- to answer your question, it's 1.4% on the Life side and 1.3% on P&C.

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Page 8 of 23



Company N ame: Assicuraz ioni Generali SpA
Company Ticker: G I M Equity
Date: 2020-07-30

So, I guess, it may have come down a bit by the end of the quarter, given what's
happened to (inaudible)?

A - Tim Ryan

{BIO 21076682 <GO>}

FINAL

It depends, again, on the speed of deployment on the real asset because this is a bit
more of a slow burner compared to the situation we have on the rest of the market.

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay. Great. Thanks very much, everyone.

A - Giulia Raffo

{BIO 21037091 <GO>}

Thank you, Andrew. Next question, please.

The next question is from William Hawkins with KBW. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Hello. Thank you very much for taking my call. First of all, thank you for the extra clarity on
the COVID losses on Slide 10. Apologies if I've missed this. But with regards to the EUR87
million in non-life, could you give us the breakdown of that between the gross items?
Because presumably, you've taken travel losses which are a negative, but then you have
the benefit of frequency that we've already talked about. But I'm not sure what the two
opposing numbers are getting to EUR87 million. So that's question one, if you could tell us
the loss versus the frequency gains?
Secondly, could you update us please on where the average guarantee has got to in your
Life and force portfolio? I'm sorry if I'm out-of-date. But I think the last time you published,
it was at last year's may Investor Day when you talked about 1.2% in 2018. I'm sorry if I
missed it at the end of last year. Could you just give us an update on where that average
guarantee has got to? Presumably, it's not changed much. I'm just assuming it may be
down a little bit, and I'd like to check.
And then lastly, could I ask you just to comment a little bit more on your dividend outlook?
Your formal comments are reassuring with regards to the second tranche. But you are
being very clear that that depends on the norms and regulatory recommendations
concerning dividend payments. And as far as I can see, the outlook for that is still very
uncertain. And if the banks are anything to go and buy it's still quite a challenge. So I
appreciate that you guys in terms of your numbers seem to be screening fine against
your own assessment of risk. But I'm not sure where you think you are with regards to the
overall regulatory environment. Thank you.

A - Giulia Raffo

{BIO 21037091 <GO>}

Thank you. Cristiano, I suggest you take the first question on the detail around the COVID
impact on our P&C operating. And if you can take also the second question on the
Page 9 of 23



Company N ame: Assicuraz ioni Generali SpA
Company Ticker: G I M Equity
Date: 2020-07-30

average guarantee. And then, Philippe will take the dividend question.

FINAL

A - Cristiano Borean

{BIO 15246531 <GO>}

Yes. So the EUR87 million, clearly, this is an estimation and has been done accordingly to a
methodology compared to our budget expected point, which is a fair point to be clarified
in explaining you how we did it. But basically, the EUR87 million net benefit comprises
around EUR70 million direct claims both travel and business interruption. And then we
have a figure of lower volumes, which is having a negative impact of the order of EUR100
million. And then this goes on the positive side, with the lower claims frequency due to
the reduced activity in particularly motor. So the net effect of this is bringing a positive
EUR180 million, between negative volumes part and positive effect on technical
profitability.
And then you have another delta between this EUR180 million and to get to the EUR87
million, which is a combination of lower income from regular income, especially dividends - less dividends in the first half of the year, concentrated and having a higher impact on a
pro rata basis because it's on half year and not on the full year but -- and then other
operating costs coming from COVID-related initiatives, which are not included in the
technical results but are mainly related to the support of the business given for the
operational functioning during this very complex moment.

Bloomberg Transcript

Second point related to this is that we are in between 1.25% to 1.3%, in that range, in the
middle of that range. That should be the expected average range -- rate guarantee you
have on our Life book.
And this will proceed in this way according to the transformation of the lower guarantees
coming from the new business that we underwrite, which are done also in some cases at
negative guarantees.
Don't forget -- don't focus only on the average guarantee of the book. Take, for example,
into account, that 27% of the saving business and done in Italy in the first half has been
done with the only debt benefit guarantee and not financial guarantee related to that,
which is bringing further down the strain on the capital consumption of the saving
business. We'll clearly update you with the detailed figure for the year-end figures.

A - Giulia Raffo

{BIO 21037091 <GO>}

Philippe?

A - Philippe Donnet

{BIO 4657671 <GO>}

Thank you, William. As approved by our AGM in May, the second tranche of the dividend is
to be paid by year-end and it's subject to the Board's verification. The board will be held
on November 11. And the Board will check the compliance with limit set by our group's risk
appetite framework as of September 30, as well as the compliance with the regulation
and with the recommendations of the regulator. So nothing new.

Q - Michael Igor Huttner

{BIO 21454754 <GO>}

Thank you so much. And the three questions, one on the numbers. And I'm really sorry, I
didn't follow precisely the answer you gave to Will on the claims and the impact in nonLife, because I came up with a negative figure in total and clearly it's a positive EUR87
million. So just wondered if you could help me on that.
And then you talked about the cash position and can you update a little bit on what it is?
And what the cash flow you see for the whole of the year, given your target of the midteen, I think over EUR7 billion over three years. And then the last point, I just wondered if
you could talk a little bit more about to Cattolica. I noticed you mentioned it as both a
financial and a strategic investment. And I just wondered if you could kind of give on
industrial investment, give a kind of feeling where exactly it lies. Is it part of your budget of
around EUR4 billion of deals? And how do you see it developing? Thank you very much.

A - Giulia Raffo

{BIO 21037091 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Michael. I suggest Cristiano, if you can take the first two questions,
and then Philippe will take the final one.

A - Cristiano Borean

{BIO 15246531 <GO>}

For sure. So, Michael, sorry, not for being clear. I wanted to highlight also the thing -- the
claim. So the technical profitability is impacted at this claim. I just gave you a further
information, which is within the positive result of claim. We had an impact of EUR70 million
from travel and business interruption. So that you have a view of what was the impact.

Page 11 of 23



Company N ame: Assicuraz ioni Generali SpA
Company Ticker: G I M Equity
Date: 2020-07-30

FINAL

But at the end of the story, we had a positive impact in technical profitability for EUR275
million and then a negative impact for volumes of EUR100 million, which is netting out to
get the EUR180 million coming for the combination of premium and profitability overall.
And this is the EUR180 million.
From EUR180 million, EUR87 million, you need to deduct lower income for dividend, which
we did not receive from equity participation in the first half, which is even more impacting
pro rata. And second, some initiatives, which are not accounted in the technical results. So
you don't see them in the combined ratio final figure, but are there to support the
functioning of these complex moments of specific COVID environment to give to the
network and the operational and the agents and all the distributors the support needed in
order to function and produce at the end of the story, what, in my personal opinion, is a
very good result in even non-Life collection, as you have seen.

Q - Michael Igor Huttner

Bloomberg Transcript

Second point, cash. Cash is at strongest ever level. I recall you that we paid in May, the
first tranche of the dividend, and notwithstanding that last time we talked, I told you that
we had more than EUR4.1 billion. I can confirm you that we have a very healthy level about
that one-off cash, which allows us to fulfill cash and capital flexibility in such an important
and uncertain moment, which is one of our key assets, in my opinion, reaching and
reducing a lot of uncertainty coming from the future. I hope I gave you clarity.

Q - Michael Igor Huttner

Can you talk a little bit about the cash flows? Because obviously, the regulators has been -

I'm almost your age.

A - Cristiano Borean

{BIO 15246531 <GO>}

I confirm you that in -- with the last cash flow or accounted for remittance in the first
weeks of July, we are above the 90%, close to the 95% level of total remittance
expected for 2020. Now what is missing basically is some Central Eastern Europe entities
in regimes which were quite strict. But we hope that due to the healthy level of the
solvency of these subsidiaries and the liquid position, we hope that after this summer
break, we will get more clarity also from the answer of the regulator. So, we are very well
positioned to fulfill this 2020 remittance pattern.

And the position in cash now, you're saying it's higher than in Q1, even after paying that
first tranche of the dividend?

FINAL

A - Cristiano Borean

{BIO 15246531 <GO>}

It is higher and at healthier level. So this is bringing us the confidence. Don't forget that in
July, we spent some money for the liability management exercise. So it is higher even
though we did that?

Philippe, over to you for the Cattolica question.

A - Philippe Donnet

{BIO 4657671 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Thank you, Michael. So the potential investment in Cattolica is both strategic industrial
and also financial, because it's an investment. It's still potential because, as you know, it's
subject to the transformation from cooperative company into joint stock company. And
the meeting of the shareholders of Cattolica will decide tomorrow if they accept, if they
approve the transformation and the capital increase proposed by the Board of Directors
of Cattolica. So at this stage, I would say it's still potential.
If we make the investment, it will be something around EUR350 million for having 24.4%
of the company. And it goes, obviously, together with an industrial partnership on asset
management, on reinsurance, on the health insurance, and on internet of things. So this
industrial partnership would provide additional revenues and earnings for Generali.
Basically, this is what I can comment at this stage about this partnership.

Q - Michael Igor Huttner

{BIO 21454754 <GO>}

And is there any -- given your position in Italy, which is quite large, would the regulator -- is
there a potential risk that the regulator says, "Oh, you can influence a bigger share -- part
of the market now."

A - Philippe Donnet

{BIO 4657671 <GO>}

We don't see this kind of issue. We don't see any kind of antitrust issue at this stage.

The next question is from Farooq Hanif with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi, everybody. I hope you can hear me well. My first question just coming back to
Cattolica, can you give us some idea of how much of the assets you might manage? And
to what extent you will be reinsuring? So that we can get maybe some clue on the
potential uplift next year, if this potential deal goes through. So just a scope of that, what
kind of return do you expect? That's the first question area.
Secondly, going back to just clarify on the claims frequency benefit. So, I believe, Cristiano,
you said it was at EUR271 million benefit. So the actual claims frequency is just that part. I
just want to clarify that number again.

Bloomberg Transcript

And then lastly, going back to Life. I mean excluding the Cometa contract, obviously
volumes are down. They're not down that much considering the environment. Just
wondering, what you're seeing in terms of Life in Q3. I mean with your updated systems
with lockdown ending, is there a pickup now happening? Could you please talk about
that? Thank you very much.

A - Giulia Raffo

{BIO 21037091 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Farooq. Sorry, can I ask you a favor of the first question? It didn't
come out too well. At some point, the sound broke. Can you repeat, please, on the
Cattolica?

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Yes, of course. Thank you. So the scope of the asset management and the reassurance of
Cattolica, some numbers maybe to give us an idea if the deal goes through and what
your ambition is.

A - Philippe Donnet

{BIO 4657671 <GO>}

Before letting -- thank you, Farooq. This is Philippe speaking. Before letting Tim Ryan
answer on the asset management, I would first say that for the time being it's still a
potential investment. So, for the timing, it's not real. We will know more about this
tomorrow night.

A - Tim Ryan

{BIO 21076682 <GO>}

On the scope -- Farooq, on the scope of the agreement that will be subject, again, as

asset management services around LDI, Liability Driven Investments, as well as real
estate. And the scope will be in the double digit of billions of euros.

FINAL

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

And can I just follow-up on the reinsurance? I mean I know it's early, but presumably you
would be able to add a lot of value to the motor book and the non-motor book of
Cattolica?

A - Tim Ryan

{BIO 21076682 <GO>}

No, it's impossible at this stage to provide the details of what will be the reinsurance
agreement. We -- I think that the first step is tomorrow, after that, obviously, we would
discuss the detail of the agreement.

Frederic?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Frederic Marie de Courtois D'Arcollieres
On claims frequency, what are the benefits on the claims frequency? So first, you have to
know that we've closed our accounts and especially on the claims side, we've closed
these accounts in a cautious way, I would say, which means even more cautious than we
were used to do in the past. Why have we done so? Because there are a lot of
uncertainties over the coming months, and we thought that it was a good policy to be
extremely cautious in closing our accounts and in closing our claims.
So, you do not -- you see part of the benefits of the claims frequency in the half year
accounts. You do not see all of it, I mean, we will see what happens on the -- in the
coming months. There were scenarios, I mean we had been looking at China and at the
increased traffic in China after the lockdown. So we were thinking that frequencies may
increase after the lockdown. Now, we are monitoring this extremely carefully. And as I said
before, in July, frequencies have not come back yet to have not fully come back to normal
levels.
So again, your question is absolutely valid. You see -- but it's complex to answer. So you
see part of the benefits in our combined ratio in the first half. You do not see everything,
because we've been cautious, and we are anticipating or we are -- we want to anticipate
potentially what happens in the coming months. But again, if you ask me in the second
half, how frequencies will be. I cannot tell you yet. I can just tell you that in July, frequencies
are still improving compared to last year.
On the Life side, so in fact, volumes are -- have been doing well in the first 6 months. And
there is a combination of various factors. First, people and it may seem paradox, but

Page 15 of 23



Company N ame: Assicuraz ioni Generali SpA
Company Ticker: G I M Equity
Date: 2020-07-30

people have saved more in the globally in the first half, which is good for our business.

FINAL

The second factor is that our agent channel has been extremely performing over the
lockdown period and that was something we had never experienced. So we were not
sure of what to expect. And the combination from agents and digital tool has proved to
be an extremely strong weapon, if I may say.
So our agents have continued to advise our clients. Our agents have continued to sell.
And we are extremely happy with the performance of our agent channels around the
globe.
Then there is a third interesting factor on the Life volumes is that mix has -- and I have
already discussed this at the end of the Q1, mix have significantly improved. So, you see
that protection has continued to increase. You see that unit-linked have dramatically
improved. But even if you exclude this specific pension contract in Italy, unit-linked have
slightly improved over the first 6 months and Generali new business has decreased.

Bloomberg Transcript

And I would say that this is extremely interesting, because this is different from previous
crisis that we had experienced in which clients were selling their unit-linked products to
invest in guaranteed products. And we've not seen this at all, and we're happy to see that
the mix has continued to improve.
What will happen next? It's difficult for me to say. We've made a big survey in about 20
countries where we're active. Clients tell us that they want to be more protected and that
they want to invest more in life insurance products. This is what they tell us, which is a
good signal. Will it happen? I cannot tell you yet. But let's say that we are quite positive
based on this survey and what clients tell us. But again, this is an uncertainty.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

A - Giulia Raffo

{BIO 21037091 <GO>}

Cristiano, do you want to add something on the claims side?

A - Cristiano Borean

{BIO 15246531 <GO>}

Yes, I think this could help also for you, Farooq, to dig a little bit. Clearly -- okay, apart from
the lower nat cat burden of 0.3 percentage points, what you see is that the positive
contribution for prior years development decreased to 2.5% compared to 4.1% of last
year.
But this drop ahs very well underlined by -- highlighted by Frederic, does not reflect the
change in the strength of the reserving position. This is rather contingent on prudency and
the liquidation of the claims in the process of the current COVID-19 environment. And as a
proof point of this, if I just look in the capital generation of the first half of the year, which

Page 16 of 23



Company N ame: Assicuraz ioni Generali SpA
Company Ticker: G I M Equity
Date: 2020-07-30

before deducting for the accrued dividend pro rata -- so, I'm just saying capital
generation, what happens in that, before the dividend deduction is 10 percentage points.

FINAL

And if I look at the contribution coming from the non-Life part, in the first half of 2020, I
have a capital generation which is higher than the full 2019 capital generation non-Life,
which is I think the fair element to be looked when we look at what was the impact. Hope I
gave you more insight.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Hi, guys. Thank you very much. A couple of questions, please. Really just follow-ups. First,
coming back on Switzerland. Question is, what prompted you to strengthen the reserves
now? Is it the market? Or the regulator? Or a combination of the two? And then -- sorry,
just very quickly coming back on PYD. Cristiano, I wasn't quite sure, you were saying it's
obviously fallen to 2.5%. But is 4% still what you would expect on a normal basis? Thanks
very much.

A - Giulia Raffo

{BIO 21037091 <GO>}

Frederic?

A - Frederic Marie de Courtois D'Arcollieres
Hi, Nick. Usually, to say that we always close our accounts in agreement with the regulator,
especially as for the reserving of this kind of product in Switzerland, the rules are principalbased. So, we've always agreed with the regulator on how much should be the guarantee
reserve and at which pace it should be done. Then the trigger figure is the low level of
interest rates. And again, this is why we decided, and again, in agreement with the
regulator, to make strong acceleration figure.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

I'm sorry. Just as -- Frederic, just a very quick follow-up. These financial guarantees are
interest rate guarantees rather than equity guarantees? Or are they -- you mentioned
equities, I think, as well.

Page 17 of 23



Company N ame: Assicuraz ioni Generali SpA

The underlying are unit-linked products and we are investing in low volatility funds, so
which are -- so the main risk is interest rate risk and there is some limited equity risk.

Q - Nick Holmes

Understood.

Cristiano, on the PYD outlook?

year development in the, let's say, not uncertain environment, but prudent reserving as
we made in the first half.

Q - Nick Holmes

Okay. Thank you very much. That's very clear.

A - Giulia Raffo

{BIO 21037091 <GO>}

Thank you. Next question, please.

Bloomberg Transcript

Operator
The next question is from Colm Kelly with UBS. Please go ahead.

Q - Colm Kelly

{BIO 19140684 <GO>}

Thank you. First one on capital management. The normalized capital generation was
strong in the first half at EUR1.9 billion due to the booth from P&C, as we looking forward
to potential recessionary scenarios where the P&C results might be more normalized and
the Life contribution may be impacted by continued lower investment income and lower
new business value, do you remain confident that Generali can deliver on the normalized
capital generation target of EUR10.5 billion over the 2021 plan? That's the first question.
The second question is just relating to the reserving action and the ongoing profitability
drive for the Swiss Life business. I suppose as the action today and over the first half, alter
your view on the strategic position of that business and the Swiss for trip [ph] business
within the Generali Group. Given that it's unlikely to generate profitable growth or
generate a high-return on capital deployed which are core metrics within the Generali
2021 plan.
And then lastly and maybe simply on the BTP solvency sensitivities, you very helpfully gave
an update in March around the BTP sensitivity changes from the full year due to the
country specific VA, volatility adjustment. Given the changes in spreads since then, would
you mind updating on any material changes to that BTP solvency sensitivity? The 197%

Page 18 of 23



Company N ame: Assicuraz ioni Generali SpA
Company Ticker: G I M Equity
Date: 2020-07-30

solvency would suggest it may have changed again. So an update would be very helpful?
Thank you.

A - Giulia Raffo

{BIO 21037091 <GO>}

FINAL

Cristiano, I suggest you answer the first and the last question. And then Frederic will take
the question on Switzerland.

A - Cristiano Borean

{BIO 15246531 <GO>}

Absolutely. So Colm, fair point to say that there is a kind of support as of today in the P&C
capital generation. But what I would like to stress is you need to take into account
different factors. Going forward, our product mix as well highlighted by Frederic was giving
even more in the capital light space. And even in the saving world, as I was telling you, for
example, in Italy, 27% of the saving has been done without a financial guarantee only with
a death benefit in case of that you guarantee the amount of premium, nothing else, which
is a very healthy capacity to generate a new business margin. We are continuously
focusing in growing the ancillary guarantees and protection part in this business and the
unit-linked collection, which allows us to be confident to get to the capital generation
level, knowing the fact that we are doing well in growth also for the P&C part with a very
healthy growth on the non-motor component.

Bloomberg Transcript

Having said that, so we are not in this environment under pressure for the EUR10.5 billion.
We will see the evolution going forward, but we were very well dynamically acting against
this. And our new products are showing this form of resilience. I think you've seen from
our new business margin.
Third point related to sensitivity on BTP. Are they changed from the final year? Let me say
that, no. Because if I look as of also these days, we are at level of spread which are not
far, even slightly better than at the year-end. And in a level of not activation of the so
called country specific VA. So, we need really an opening of BTP spread, let's say, as of
the half year condition, end of June, okay, because that was the last moment we
calculated.
The trigger would have been with flat corporate spray that as of end of June, we would
have need something in the order of 50 bps to 60 bps of further opening of BTP spread
before triggering the country-specific volatility adjustment. So, no big changes in my
opinion to the sensitivity reported. Hope I gave you --

A - Frederic Marie de Courtois D'Arcollieres
Colm, on your second question, it's important to understand that our Swiss business is
made of three different bits. We have a good P&C business on a market which is
profitable. We have a good Life new business. And we have this book, which has been
underwritten between 2000 and 2009, which obviously is not good and which is
impacting our result for the time being.
So I would not tell you that we are happy with this result in Switzerland. But as of today,
our strategic view on the market and the company has not changed.

Next question, please.

The next question is from Ashik Musaddi with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Yes. Hi. Thank you. This is Ashik Musaddi. Just a quick follow-up on Swiss business again,
sorry for this. I mean, how should we think about the mark-to-market impact of low
interest rates on that business? I think you mentioned that it would be negative triple-digit
value for the -- I think I also heard that you're talking about adding EUR300 million results
in first half and then similar in second half.

Bloomberg Transcript

So how can it be only -- mid triple-digit negative value if you're adding EUR600 million just
in 2020? So, what are we missing here? I mean any thoughts on like longer-term market
consistent value of that business would be good.
Secondly, is in terms of asset allocation of the asset business. Can you give us some color
on where those assets are invested? I mean just to understand, like is it possible for you
to get a yield pickup by going up on the risk on that asset base and reduce the interest
rate drag on that? Thank you.

A - Giulia Raffo

{BIO 21037091 <GO>}

Ashik, sorry. I didn't get the second question, apologies.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

No, that's fine. The second question is simple is what is the asset allocation of that Swiss
Life book? Just to understand if you can go up on the risk to address the low interest rate
problem on that business? Thanks.

A - Giulia Raffo

{BIO 21037091 <GO>}

Tim, I don't know if you want to take this second question first.

A - Tim Ryan

{BIO 21076682 <GO>}

Sure, I will take the second question on your question on the asset allocation. We have,
like any business that is related to Life, a very conservative approach that is to rely on
fixed income and also to deploy within the real asset, especially on real estates. So the
answer is that we have room to take risk. We are obviously very careful about the
adjustment that you need to do to back some of the guarantees.
Page 20 of 23



Company N ame: Assicuraz ioni Generali SpA
Company Ticker: G I M Equity
Date: 2020-07-30

So, we are using both the government for the typical duration matching as well as
corporate bond spreads, which we look at hedging back into Swiss franc. And on the
margins, you have a pickup around the real estate and investing in a very prudent way in
the debt mortgages as well in Switzerland, which is a very high margin business for us.

FINAL

A - Giulia Raffo

{BIO 21037091 <GO>}

Thank you. And Frederic, do you want to take the first question on the interest rates?

A - Frederic Marie de Courtois D'Arcollieres
Yes. No. On your first question on mark-to-market. So, I said that our estimate is midtriple-digit negative on this(ph) book of business in mark-to-market. Of course, it depends
very much on your interest rate assumption.
Just as a reminder, we'll have -- in 2023, we'll have IFRS 17. So, at this point, this would be - everything will be really mark-to-market. I cannot see much more. This is again, the -- as
I've said, we have this negative investment margin very interest rate dependent. And we
have extremely high fees and mortality margins, which are not interest rate sensitive.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Okay. So is it fair to say that the EUR600 million hit that you'll be taking this year is just to
do with the recent interest rate decline? Or is it a bit of a catch up from past as well? I
mean what I'm trying to understand is like, how should we think about future reserving
additions, et cetera, if interest rates don't change. So I mean if it is, let's say, the EUR600
million is just because of this recent drop in interest rate and then more or less -- I don't
think you would need to worry in the future too much. But if there is a bit of catch up from
past as well as then probably interest rates plays a bit of a role here because interest rate
have been declining for past, let's say, 10 years.

A - Frederic Marie de Courtois D'Arcollieres
As I said, the EUR600 million is directly linked to a catch-up on the lower interest rates.
And I've said that after this having done this catch up and this and if interest rates remain
where they are, we will come back to more normal levels.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Yes. That's very clear. Thank you.

FINAL

Thank you very much for this chance. Just on the solvency, I was hoping solvency would be
up versus Q1. It's actually down. And I was trying to work out the moving parts. It's in
Other, and I know you have this thing about the adjustment of the bank, which I think is
cost about 1%. Other for me was a delta of 3%. And I just wondered if there's something
here which I've missed.

A - Giulia Raffo

{BIO 21037091 <GO>}

Cristiano, this is for you.

A - Cristiano Borean

{BIO 15246531 <GO>}

No, there is nothing specific on this part. On the other -- the only important thing you have
to keep in mind it has been the DSI transaction and the plan for the employees of
Generali where we bought back the shares of Generali which then are non-eligible on
funds item for a temporary moment because then we will give them that in 2022 at the
end of the plan.
So it's a temporary drop, let's say, due to the execution of the plan. Nothing more
specifically missed apart from the EUR100 million COVID expenses on an International
Fund. These were the three elements. But in the first quarter, we booked the COVID in
the IFRS account already.
