Thank you, Andrea. Good morning. This is Tom Gayner, I'm joined this morning Co-CEO,
Richie Whitt, and our CFO, Jeremy Noble and it's our pleasure to welcome you to the
Markel Corporation first half 2019 financial update call. The purpose of this call is to

FINAL

connect with you our owners and to provide you with an update on our financial
performance through the first half of 2019. We'll also offer some commentary about
current events and circumstances around Markel, and we look forward to any and all
questions you'd like to ask us about your business.
We're pleased to report to you that we're off to a good start through the first six months
of 2019. The overall financial results are quite good and Jeremy will provide you with the
numbers and some details in just a minute. As always Markel is a complicated place, one
beauty of that complication though, is that we've created a structure and architecture
which fosters the ability to make good capital allocation choices and absorb some
learning and tuition we sometimes pay along the way so that we can keep getting better.
As we've discussed for many years our rank order and allocating capital is first to invest in
and support our existing businesses when we have reinvestment opportunities to help
them achieve profitable growth. Second, we look for acquisitions that add to our existing
businesses or create new fields for us to plan, third we build our portfolio of publicly
traded equity securities and fourth when appropriate, we repurchase Markel stock. We did
all four of these in the first half of 2019.

Bloomberg Transcript

In addition to this financial lens and language of allocating capital, at the same time we run
and manage our business through the human lens and language laid out in the guiding
principles of the Markel style. Through the integrated thought that takes into account the
financial metrics and the human and humane values we think we're running Markel in such
a way that we will be able to gain the privilege of doing it again tomorrow .
The midpoint of 2019, each of our three engines of Insurance, Investments and Markel
Ventures created positive value and energy for Markel. We've got some cylinders in those
engines that are firing wonderfully rest assured that we diligently keep our eyes on all of
the gauges and will never become complacent where things are going well, we can
always do better.
We've also got some cylinders with shall we say, more room for improvement, and we're
working on those as well. I think it's important at all times to remain even (inaudible) and
work with diligence, both in the areas where things look great and also where they don't.
That's what we do every day as (inaudible) says in the song, 'I still haven't found what I'm
looking for'. Q2 is still working and looking and so are we, and so with that introduction, I'd
like to turn things over to Jeremy to review the numbers from the first half. After Jeremy's
comments which will cover our insurance and related operations and then I'll return with a
few words about investments in Markel Ventures.
Following that, we'll open up the floor for questions. Jeremy?

Jeremy A. Noble

{BIO 20687803 <GO>}

Thanks, Tom good morning everyone. All three of our operating engines made
meaningful contributions to our results in the first six months of 2019. We continue to see
outstanding performance in our investment portfolio during the first half of the year.

FINAL

Mirroring the strong performance of the broader equity market operating results
attributable to Markel Ventures operations increased substantially, and we also
experienced meaningful premium growth in our underwriting operations. The first six
months of 2019, total operating revenues grew 38% to approximately $4.9 billion. The
increase was driven by just over $1 billion of net investment gains on our equity portfolio in
2019 resulting from favorable market movement additionally, revenues from Markel
Ventures segment increased 10% year-over-year .
Looking at our underwriting results, gross written premiums were $3.3 billion for the first
half of 2019, compared to $3 billion in 2018, an increase of 9%, which was attributable to
higher gross premium volume in both our Insurance and Reinsurance segment. Retention
of gross written premiums increased one point from 83% in 2018 and 84% in 2019 this
increase was driven by an increase in the net retention within the insurance segment,
resulting from higher retention on our general liability and professional liability product line
partially offset by lower retention on our personal lines business.

Bloomberg Transcript

Earned premiums increased 5% to $2.4 billion in the first half of 2019 due to higher written
premium volume in our insurance segment partially offset by lower earnings in our
Reinsurance segment. Our consolidated combined ratio for the first six months 2019 was
95% compared to 91% last year. The increase in the consolidated combined ratio was
primarily driven by less favorable development on prior year's loss reserves within our
insurance segment.
Now I'll cover the results of our Markel Ventures segment. Revenues from Markel Ventures
increased to $1.1 billion compared to $971 million a year ago. The increased revenues were
primarily attributable to higher revenues across our products businesses which includes
our Q4 2018 acquisition of Brahmin leather works. EBITDA for Markel Ventures was $160
million for the first half of 2019, compared to $82 million last year. In 2019 our strong
EBITDA reflects improved operating results of one of our consumer and building products
businesses as well as the contributions from Brahmin. 2018 EBITDA was adversely
impacted by an accrual associated with the manufacture of products at one of our
businesses.
Turning to our investment results, net investment income increased to $213 million in the
first half of 2018 to $226 million this year. The increase was driven by higher dividend
income due to increased equity holdings and dividend rate. A higher short-term
investment income due to higher short-term interest rates compared to the same period
of 2018. Net investment gains included in net income were $1 billion for the first half of
2019 compared to a net investment losses of $18 million in 2018.
As I mentioned earlier, substantially all of our net investment gains in 2019 were
attributable to the increase in the fair value of our equity portfolio during the period. Net
unrealized investment gains, increased $281 million net of taxes during the first half of
2019, reflecting an increase in the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio resulting from
declines and interest rates over the same period. Given our long-term focus variability in
the timing of investment gains and losses is to be expected. Looking at our consolidated
results for the year, our effective tax rate was 22% in 2019, compared to 47% a year ago.

As I've mentioned previously, the impact of management's decision to elect to treat two
of our UK subsidiaries as US taxpayers beginning in 2018 at $102 million or 25% in 2018
effective tax rate. Our estimated annual effective tax rate, which excludes this impact, as
well as certain other items that are infrequent or unusual in nature, is 21% in 2019 and 20%
in 2018. We reported net income to shareholders of $1.1 billion for the first half of 2019,
compared to $214 million a year ago. And comprehensive income to shareholders for the
period was $1.4 million compared to a comprehensive loss to shareholders of $11 million a
year ago.
Comprehensive income for the first six months of 2019 was driven by net income the
components of which I just discussed, along with an increase in the fair value of our fixed
maturity securities since the end of 2018. Finally, I'll make a few comments on cash flows
capital and our balance sheet. Net cash provided by operating activities was $249 million
for the first six months of 2019, compared to $308 million for the same period in 2018.

Bloomberg Transcript

Operating cash flows for 2019 reflected higher claim settlement activity and lower cash
flows from our Markel Ventures operations compared to 2018, largely due to the timing of
working capital fluctuations. Invested assets at the holding company were $3.1 billion at
June 30, 2019, compared to $2.6 billion at December 31. The increase in the holding
company invested assets is due to our second quarter issuance of $600 million, a 30 year
maturity unsecured senior note, partially offset by $212.5 million of cash used to acquire a
minority interest in the Hagerty Group, a leading provider of specialty insurance to
automobile enthusiasts.
Total shareholders' equity stood at $10.4 billion at the end of June, an increase of 14%
from year-end. We repurchased 68,000 shares in the first six months of the year pursuant
to our outstanding share repurchase program. With that, I'll turn it over to Richie, to talk
more about our underwriting program services and ILS results.

Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Thanks Jeremy and good morning everyone. As Jeremy said today, I'll focus my
comments on our underwriting operations. I will also provide brief updates on State now -State National program services business and our insurance linked securities operation.
Headlines for the first six months include solid underwriting results combined with strong
premium growth, resulting from a combination of organic growth and an improving pricing
momentum.
We're also pleased with the progress we've seen from our recently acquired State
National Nephila [ph] operations. So starting with the insurance segment gross written
premiums for the quarter are up $134 million or 11% compared to the second quarter of
'18. For the first six months, Premiums were up $234 million or 10%. Premium growth for
both for the quarter and the six months was driven by continued strong organic growth
across several product lines most notably, our General Liability, Professional Liability,
Personal Lines and Marine and Energy products.

Page 4 of 15



FINAL

Company N ame: M arkel Corp
Company Ticker: M K L US Equity

Earned premiums for the segment are up 8% for the quarter and six months with similar
drivers as the gross written premium increases. The combined ratio for the insurance
segment was 95 for the second quarter of 2019, compared to 92 last year. This three
point increase in the combined ratio was driven by less favorable development on prior
accident year loss reserves, partially offset by a lower expense ratio. The decrease in
favorable development on prior accident year's losses was primarily driven by less
favorable development in our workers' compensation line and more adverse
development in our property line. Lower expense ratio in the quarter was primarily driven
by the impact of higher earned premiums.
The combined ratio for the first six months for the insurance segment was 95% versus
90% for the same period a year ago, with the increase driven by less favorable
development on prior accident year losses primarily in our Professional Liability, Marine
and Energy and workers' compensation, product lines. Higher earned premiums for the
first six months, had a favorable impact on our expense ratio and an unfavorable impact
on the prior year's loss ratio.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning next to reinsurance, gross written premiums for the quarter were up $14 million or
7% compared to the second quarter of '18. On a year-to-date basis, premiums were up
$36 million or 5%. Premium growth in the quarter was driven by an increase in our general
liability line due to the timing impact of renewals and multi-year contracts. This was
partially offset by a decrease in professional liability due to non-renewals. Premium growth
for the year is also driven by the timing impacts within our general liability line along with
growth in our workers' compensation line due to higher premiums upon renewal.
As mentioned previously, significant volatility in gross written premium volume can be
expected in our reinsurance segment, due to individually significant deals and the timing
of renewals on multiyear contracts. Earned premiums for the segment decreased by 10%
in the quarter. And 8% for the first six months, due to the runoff of earned premium from
a large specialty quota share treaty that was non-renewed, and higher ceded earned
premium resulting from changes in our outward property reinsurance structure. This was
partially offset by growth in earned premiums in professional liability due to increases in
gross written premiums in previous quarters.
The combined ratio for the Reinsurance segment was 96% for the second quarter of
2019, compared to 90% last year. This six point increase in the combined ratio was driven
by a higher current accident year loss ratio and expense ratio. The increase in the current
accident year loss ratio was primarily driven by our product, our property product lines
where we've had increased purchases of excess of loss and catastrophe reinsurance
coverage, resulting in a higher net attritional loss ratio in 2019.
The increase in the expense ratio was driven by the impact from lower earned premiums
along with higher compensation costs in the current year. The combined ratio for the first
six months for the Reinsurance segment was 97% compared to 94% a year ago, again
driven by higher current accident year loss ratio and expense ratio. The increase in the
current loss ratio for the first six months was driven by changes in the property
reinsurance that I just discussed, partially offset by the impact of favorable premium
adjustments across multiple product lines. The increase in the expense ratio for the first

FINAL

six months was driven by the impact of lower earned premiums along with higher
compensation expense.
Next, I'll make a few comments about the State National program services business.
Gross written premium volume for our State National program services operations was
$655 million for the quarter and $1.2 billion for the six months, up 18% and 16%
respectively from the same period last year. This was driven by organic growth across
several existing programs. As a reminder, almost all of the gross written premium at State
National is ceded to third party reinsurers.
Total ceded fee revenues were up 11% and 13% on a quarter and six month basis, from
last year due to continued growth in program premium volumes over multiple quarters.
We are very pleased with State National's strong six months performance. In addition, and
as we expected State National is proving strategically important to Nephila and our overall
ILS strategy. As a reminder amounts for our program services operations are reported in
services and other revenue expenses within our operating results.

Bloomberg Transcript

Next, I'll discuss insurance linked securities operation. With the completion of the Nephila
acquisition in November of last year, we have significantly increased Markel's ILS
operation. With our Nephila and Markel CATCo operations, we have approximately $13.7
billion of net assets under management as of June 30, 2019. Total revenues from our ILS
operations were $50 million in the quarter and $104 million for the first six months of 2019,
versus $17 million and $35 million for the same periods last year.
The increase in revenue in both periods is due to the contribution of revenue from
Nephila partially offset by lower revenues from Markel CATCo due to lower assets under
management and a reduction in management fees charged on side pocket shares which
are shares that are restricted from redemption. Operating revenues for both periods
were impacted by cost associated with internal reviews of matters at Markel CATCo
operations and related litigation costs, the effects of which were more than offset by
lower retention and incentive compensation costs in 2019, compared to '18. A number of
items are creating a very complicated picture for ILS results in 2019.
Related to Nephila purchase accounting adjustments, brokerage revenue and expenses
from our Velocity MGA in delayed fee recognition on side pockets make it makes it
difficult to see the underlying performance. As these items burn off through the rest of
2019, the picture will clear up. Sifting through the noise caused by these items Nephila is
broadly on target to meet our expectations from the beginning of the year. The primary
differences in the actual underlying results compared to our initial expectations is
attributed to have a lower net assets under management resulting from the 2018 loss
events and the film are taking a disciplined approach to long-term value creation for
investors heading into 2019.
Related to Markel CATCo the run-off of the business and the associated cost of the
internal review and litigation have resulted in losses for the quarter, in the first six months
of the year. As a reminder amounts from our ILS operations are also reported within
services and other revenue expenses within our operating results.

FINAL

Regarding Markel CATCo last week CATCo announced it will cease accepting new
investments. It will not write any new business going forward. Markel CATCo will
commence the orderly run off of its existing portfolio which is expected to take up to
three years. These decisions were made in light of the fact that substantially all of the
capital in the funds which tendered for redemption and the inquiries from government
authorities in the loss reserves recorded in late '17 and early '18 at Markel CATCo remain
ongoing.
Markel however strongly believes that the insurance linked security market is here to stay.
We'll continue to grow and there is an area where we are establishing a market leading
position with our recent acquisitions of Nephila and State National. Building on these
successes last week, we announced our plans to establish a new retrocessional insurance
linked securities platform in Bermuda. The new platform is expected to allow us to
expand our current range of ILS capability drawing, on the deep talent and resources from
across the Markel organization.

Bloomberg Transcript

This platform will be overseen by Markel Global Reinsurance veterans, Jed Rhoads and
Andrew Barney Barnard. Initial product offerings are expected to include a property
catastrophe retrocessional investment head of the 2020 renewal period. The fund is
expected to offer seasons a suite of property retrocessional products with the ability to
have coverage provided either on a collateralized basis or on a rated paper basis written
by Markel Bermuda Limited, or a combination of both.
Finally, some market commentary market conditions there, market conditions continue to
improve in an incremental fashion. We continue to see month over month price
improvements in most lines of business. Florida renewals broadly met our expectations,
and I believe market expectations for price increases however, given higher frequency
and severity assumptions following the last two years of cat activity more rate will likely be
needed in 2020. We continue to see low to middle single-digit price increases in
professional and casualty lines but, we would still describe most of these areas as
competitive. It seems very clear that the market is in transition with carriers reinvesting
their expectations for CAT frequency and severity and professional and casualty results
clearly needing rate increases after several years of decrease.
There has been much discussion in the market of increased increasing claims trend and
whether rate increases are keeping pace. I think the reality is that the answer will differ by
line of business and it's going to take time to know a definitive answer. Our sense is that
professional and casualty lines need rate increases to account for increasing claims trends
it would be foolish to assume that all price increases will fall directly to the bottom line.
Similar to last quarter, the only major line where pricing is declining at the moment is
workers' compensation, as a result of its good results over the last several years and
highly regulated nature. We believe that workers' compensation is still profitable, but
clearly the margin that we have seen in the business over the past several years is
shrinking. We are cautiously optimistic that the incremental rating environment
improvement will continue during the rest of the year.

FINAL

So to some, the first half of the year up we feel very good about the progress made in
our underwriting ILS and program services operations. Market conditions continue to
improve and we are growing profitably across our businesses. We are intently focused on
finding ways to leverage Markel's unique set of capabilities for our customers. Thanks for
your time today. And I'd like to turn it to Tom.

Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Thank you. Richie. Well as you can see from the numbers we enjoyed wonderful results in
both Markel Ventures and in our investment operations during the first half of 2019. At
Markel Ventures we set new records in revenues and EBITDA, revenues exceeded $1
billion during the first half and EBITDA of $161 million gives a vivid picture of the size and
scope as well as profitability of our Markel Ventures operations. We continue to enjoy
strong results from our industrial businesses where we expect cyclicality. Those
businesses all continue to perform well, both due to their own efforts and management
expertise as well as a continuing favorable economic environment. Our companies to
tend not to be as economically sensitive, also continue to grow and perform well and
we're gaining ground in some spots where we had ground to gain. All in all, I just want to
thank you, the shareholders, my colleagues and our Board of Directors for your patient
confidence that we were making good capital allocation decisions as we work to build
Markel Ventures.
It is delightful for me to be able to report to you overall, solid organic growth and doubledigit percentage EBITDA profitability that we've discussed. The environment to add new
companies to Markel Ventures remains tough as valuations continue to be high across the
marketplace. Fortunately, we continue to enjoy organic growth opportunities within many
of the businesses that we already own. Also, our track record of financial performance
along with our values based long-term approach continues to cause people to seek us
out about the possibility of joining the Markel family.
We will keep working diligently on what we have and we will remain open-minded and
flexible as we consider growth opportunity. In our investment operations we had excellent
results during the first half of the year in our equity portfolio, we are 19.4% during the first
half which exceeds the return of the S&P 500. This result continues our record of outperformance that now dates back for 30 years.
In general, I would, usually expect us to underperform in straight up bull markets like
we've been experiencing so far in 2019, given our defensive and value-oriented approach.
That said I don't propose to (inaudible). I'll take we will continue to invest with the exact
same discipline and approach that we followed for decades.
Fortunately, we continue to find what we believe a reasonable equity investments to
make at this time. In our fixed income operations we earned a more than coupon return
of 5% that result came from lower overall levels of interest rate and ongoing diligence
from our fixed income team to maintain pristine credit quality. We're letting the duration
of our bond portfolio naturally come in a bit since we can garner any enthusiasm we're
committing to the low rates of return currently on offer in the long-term bond market.

FINAL

We'd rather sell debt than buy it at this time and we're acting in accord with this belief. We
continue to methodically and steadily invest in equity between ongoing investments and
appreciation our publicly traded equity portfolio and our equity holders now stand at 66%
of total shareholders' equity up from 62% at year-end .
We believe that our balanced debt and disciplined an unrelenting approach the building
our portfolio of partially owned businesses I publicly traded stocks alongside building the
value of the Markel Ventures majority owned companies combined to work as designed
to build long-term value for all of us at Markel and by all of us, I mean, our customers, our
associates and our shareholders.
We continue to strive to build one of the world's great companies and that means running
the companies with win, win, win opportunities for all involved. Thank you for your
confidence in us and support as we do so with that thanks again for joining us today. And

Q - Jeff Schmitt

{BIO 19747235 <GO>}

Hi, good morning everyone. I know you addressed claims trends a little bit there, but just
curious if you could provide more detail I guess some competitors are seeing that tough
legal environment which was acute and like a commercial auto spreading into general
liability and in other casualty lines. Could you maybe speak to that what you're seeing
there?

A - Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Sure we don't write a lot of commercial auto, but obviously we're very aware of the issues
that have been experienced there and obviously trend particularly severity has been
problematic in commercial auto. I think we are seeing -- and it's not it's not anywhere near
what is being seen in commercial auto, but we're seeing some uptick in severity in places
like professional and casualty. It's manageable but the message we're sending our
underwriters and I think it's the right message is these rates that we're looking for, they
not just nice to have, we need to have them.
There is -- I mean we've enjoyed an incredibly benign 10 or so years quite honestly in
terms of claims trend. You would expect some reversion to the mean over time. And so
we need to get some rate in professional and casualty and other areas to make sure
we're keeping up with trends.

Okay and just a question on CATCo, with that being run off are you seeing many funds
transferred to Nephila?

FINAL

A - Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Nephila? Nephila really isn't raising funds right now. They went into 2019 after two really
tough years for their investors intent on doing the best, they could to build the best
portfolio for the existing investors and being a 100% focused on that. So you know
Nephila really has not been in a fund-raising mode in 2019.

Q - Jeff Schmitt

{BIO 19747235 <GO>}

Okay and just one last one on Markel Ventures. Could you maybe speak to the, just what
you're seeing in the M&A environment right now as we kind of approach the end of the
cycle. Just from a valuation perspective or is there much of a pipeline there?

A - Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, as I alluded to in the comments, prices are high. So our likelihood of buying
something that just comes through the traditional channels and in an auction market is
pretty doggone [ph] look, because the valuation gaps are just a bit too far for us to get
to. That said, the good news is we've got a business that has an annualized run rate of $2
billion and 17 or so different companies and they are out in the marketplace every day,
dealing with customers, dealing with vendors, dealing with competitors and they see and
frankly generate conversations and things that we will get to see that are not just part of
traditional deal for us.
So the last couple of things that we have bought have come through non-traditional
channels and I'm not going to make any predictions but we still get to talk to some pretty
interesting people with interesting businesses on a pretty regular basis and we'll do the
best we can.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Yeah, good morning. Just a few questions, I didn't see any mention of catastrophe losses
within the 10-Q forms, I was wondering if you had any meaningful amount, so just in the
aggregate by business segment or maybe just weren't that many this quarter?

FINAL

Mark, there is always catastrophes there was tornadoes and flooding and various things in
the first half of the year. It was probably and I think (inaudible) just put it out. It was
probably sort of an average first half of the year in terms of catastrophes. We just to
make things a little more simple we don't start adding up catastrophes until they are spun
[ph] to CATCo and until they exceed our dollar threshold. So we sort of have the normal
run rate of catastrophes not enough to call out in the financing.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

This is Tom. I always look forward to hearing how your name gets pronounced and this -in this particular quarter, it would be like thinking about what the injury report for the
Pittsburgh Steelers would be. I mean, there shouldn't be any, but there's training camps
and there's people riding motorcycles without helmets and stuff like that, that goes on
but fortunately, not so much this particular quarter.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, that's good and we'll hope the same for the training camp. Unrelated -- somewhat
related note, you mentioned, also in the filings that there was a little bit of a reserve
addition within the insurance segment related to prior year catastrophe losses. Could you
say what that amount was?

A - Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Hi, Mark, that is very modest and across the company, there was basically almost no
movement on the 2018 event. There were some offset between kind of reinsurance and
insurance and really we're to the point now that we are into our reinsurance protections
on the outwards to some of that is how we allocate some of the recoveries between the
insurance and reinsurance segment. But even in the insurance is very modest .

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Okay, that makes sense. Another question and this is just to clarify, there was a note that
you had acquired in a minority stake in the Hagerty, the Hagerty Group, LLC, that's just
minority stake amongst the ownership that you already have in Hagerty right or is that
some different entity?

A - Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

We've been working with Hagerty for a number of years now, but I think there was a
misconception that we had ownership in Hagerty. So we've enjoyed a fabulous
relationship and as a result of that the opportunity came up recently for us to partner with
them more closely by taking a minority shareholding. So this is our initial shareholding and
we're very excited to be more closely associated in partnering with the Hagerty Group.

FINAL

Okay. That actually very helpful and then I guess the last, the last question and maybe it
maybe it's too soon to comment at length, but you mentioned the plans to establish a
new Bermuda platform to some extent replace what CATCo had been doing. Do you
imagine a sizing similar to what CATCo had been? Or would the intent be to start
relatively smaller and build it up from there?

A - Thomas S. Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Yes. Mark probably the first thing is it's not a replacement for Markel CATCo. It's a
different strategy, a different leadership team obviously run by Jed Rhoads, Barney
Barnard and a number of their underwriting talent from the Markel Regroup. It's a different
portfolio then what CATCo was writing. In terms of size, it's going to be crawl, walk, run.
We -- success this year would be getting it off the ground and getting it started and so
we'll -- like we do so many things at Markel Corporation, it will be a crawl, walk, run
approach to it.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

I guess with that clarification then if it's not particularly a replacement just sort of a similar
type of vehicle, would it be still in the plans to eventually resurrect or relaunch or whatever
you might describe the existing CATCo platform with the current businesses being wound
down?

A - Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

You know I don't think so. Obviously we learned a lot through -- we have learned a lot
through the difficulties that CATCo had and the impact it had on their investors when we
went out and talked to investors and we've talked to virtually all of the investors in CATCo
there was very little appetite to continue to invest in the CATCo product. So, we are
following the wishes of those investors and that product will go away.

Our next question comes from Phil Stefano of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Yes, thanks , good morning. I guess just following on the last line of questions a little bit. I
was hoping you could give us a sense of the number of employees in CATCo and kind of
what they're what future looks like. Understood the new ILS Structure Fund is going to

have a different leadership team, strategy, different portfolio. Can any of these
employees move over to the new fund.

FINAL

A - Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Yes, there is about 20 -- at Markel CATCo for the coming few years job one we will
absolutely be order with the orderly run of CATCo in returning capital to the investors as
soon as humanly possible. So that will be job one, but obviously these people have
experience in all the back office functions and so forth it takes to run a fund and the hope
would be over time as CATCo winds down, they could assist in the new effort.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Okay. And going back to job one any sense you can give us how we get from $3 billion to
zero and assets under management over the next three year any sense around timing
that you can help us understand that cadence?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

You know I probably don't have any numbers I can give you today, I mean, it really is in the
hands of the -- and what's going to make it more difficult is the 2017 events, 2018 events,
it have acted differently than any events that we have seen previous to those two years.
People are continuing to report development on the '17 events, and even more
development on the Jebi events, the Michael events. So, they're going to be cautious,
they're going to be cautious in terms of releasing their collateral , obviously there's
contractual language around how releases work, but I would just expect given the way
2017 and '18 has developed, there will be a cautious approach from seeding but we are
obviously going to be working very hard with them to try to return that capital to the
investors.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Got it, okay. Switching gears and looking at reinsurance via the accident year ex-cat [ph]
loss ratio ticked up in the quarter and the explanation was that there was a change in the
outwards reinsurance structure. Was there anything one-time in nature in the second
quarter, with the change in Reinsurance or is the mid '60's probably the right way to think
about that attritional loss ratio up from the low '60s, we saw recently?

A - Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

This sort of goes back to some comments I made last quarter about we are, we're
making some changes to our reinsurance program. Our goal is always to keep as much of
the premium that we write is as possible working with our reinsurance partners, but we
want to eat our own cooking. We have switched the type of coverage that the reinsurance
Group had from a quota share structure to an excess of loss structure and CAT
protection.
So it's going to take a couple of quarters, I think for that to smooth out just around the
accounting around it and earning of that ceded premium so, it's a little distorted at the
moment and you add to the fact that CAT business is very seasonal, it's going to probably

FINAL

take to the end of the year for that to settle down into more of a steady state. And it's
Jeremy here, I would just add that we've been very focused on kind of managing volatility.
So in some ways we might experience given the change in the reinsurance program, a
slightly higher attritional loss ratio, but we should do better when there is there more
significant or severe losses.
The other thing that can impacted a little bit is mix in the portfolio. So to the extent that
we write more casualty or specialty lines the Reinsurance versus property just as a mix
that could have an impact on that attritional loss ratio as well.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Okay one good question what my hopefully quick question, was there anything in the -- in
the quarter?

A - Richard R. Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

There is nothing on origin, so you may have heard the reports that the rate change.
Subsequent to the end of the period in a move from minus 0.75 to minus 0.25, which is a
little bit less than I think what most of the industry was expecting and therefore, it will be a
Q3 event and be, it will not be significant, given the modest sort of change and as a
reminder, we just continue kind of UK -- in 2014.
