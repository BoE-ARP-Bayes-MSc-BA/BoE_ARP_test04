Before we begin, I'm obliged to caution that today's discussion may contain forwardlooking statements and actual results may differ materially from those discussed.
Additional information regarding the factors shaping these outcomes can be found in
RenaissanceRe's SEC filings to which we direct you.

FINAL

With us to discuss today's results are Kevin O'Donnell, President and Chief Executive
Officer and Bob Qutub, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin?

Kevin O'Donnell
Thanks, Peter, and thank you all for joining today's call. Last night, we released third
quarter earnings. As you know, it was a busy quarter resulting in a reduction in book value
of 11.6% and a reduction in our tangible book value per share plus accumulated dividends
of 12%. This quarter, although difficult was not surprising and validates both our view of risk
and our long-term strategy. The driver of our out-performance was of course the multiple
catastrophic events occurring in the third quarter, namely hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and
Maria and the Mexico City Earthquakes.

Bloomberg Transcript

Before moving on to a discussion of the quarter, I would like to extend my deepest
sympathies to everyone affected by the Q3 large loss events. In Mexico, the US and
especially in the Caribbean, life has still not returned to normal for many and it is our hope
that a significant number of claims we've already paid goes a little away towards
speeding recovery.
I will discuss the Q3 large loss events and their impact on RenaissanceRe in greater detail
after Bob speaks, but first I would like to address our gross to net strategy, the role of
retro markets and the increased cost of risk capital.
Our gross to net strategy was tested by the Q3 large loss events and performed well. We
pre-announced a net negative impact of 625 million for the Q3 large loss events. As you
saw in our earnings release, we now think that number will be closer to 615. Our gross
position on these events however is about 2.2 billion. This means that in excess of twothirds of our gross losses have effectively been seeded to retrocessionaire shared with
third-party capital or offset by reinstatement premiums. In addition to preserving our
capital, this strategy was highly efficient, costing us only 50% of our premium, 20% of the
expected profit on the associated business. Even after significant recoveries however, we
still have abundant retro capacity remaining in our program and we continue to offer
substantial capacity to clients.
The retro markets and especially the collateralized markets have absorbed a large share
of the Q3 large loss events. And a material portion of their capital will either be impaired
or locked up. The ability of some of these funds to recapitalize in trade forward will be
heavily dependent on rate. Investors in experiencing large losses will need material price
increases before they agree to reinvest. This could cause disruption at January 1st and
roughly three quarters when the retro market renews. This is not a problem from our
Page 2 of 25

FINAL

perspective, as our demand for retro is highly elastic. Using our integrated system, we are
able to source the most efficient capital available, sometimes that is around, sometimes
it's third-party and sometimes it's retro.
We've been a large seller of retro in the past and if the retro market harden sufficiently,
we will happily transition from a buyer to a seller in the future. While the cost of retro is
increasing, our weighted average cost of capital is decreasing. Over the last several
years, we've taken advantage of record low interest rates to replace high cost debt and
preferred shares at a lower cost. This gives us the option to put more of our own capital
at risk if we were paid sufficiently to do so.

Bloomberg Transcript

Another reason we aren't as exposed to the traditional retro market is that we have many
long-term aligned partners. When we need to augment our own capital, I think of the
potential sources is falling into two categories, short-term trades and long-term partners.
Around 75% of our ceded premium is with our long-term partners. With this capacity, we
can count on being there year-after-year, because we stand alongside on both the profits
and the losses. Having this long-term capacity has allowed us to grow overtime and
provides us flexibility when market opportunities arise.
I have been saying for years that in many lines of business, rates have reached
unsustainably low levels. This was fueled in part by the extended drought in large
catastrophic events, especially in the US. That drought is now over. It appears as if 2017
could be the third year having more than $100 billion of insured losses over the previous
'15. To put this in perspective, the worldwide annual expected insured catastrophic loss is
between 50 billion and 60 billion. Eight of the last 17 years however have come in under
40 billion, even on a trended basis with three under 20 billion. So there is a significant
amount of variance in the results and when the low loss years cluster, this can be
confused for a lack of volatility.
Years like 2017 are not outliers. However, there is a far more volatility in our sector than
many appreciate. We expect to have industry loss similar to 2017 at least every 10 years
and as a sector, we haven't been paid for this volatility for too long now. Making matters
worse, low prices and property cat have affected almost every other line in the P&C
industry with companies writing and diversifying the business to help offset property cat
rate decreases.
The cost of risk capital needs to go up and its impact will reach beyond loss affected
property deals. This quarter was a needed reminder that ours is a volatile business and
the vendor models cannot substitute for good underwriting. Allocators of capital are
better positioned to be able to determine which underwriters were skillful and which were
not and return expectations should adjust accordingly.
Looking ahead we are hopeful that 2018 will provide greater opportunities than 2017.
We're optimistic about our prospects for profitable growth and our preferential position in
the market. With both rated and collateralized balance sheets and on equaled [ph] to
access to efficient capital, we are ready and willing to trade forward to January 1 across all
our platforms in the form our customers desire.

With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob for a look at our financials and I'll come back on and
share a bit more in our business performance before we open it up for questions. Bob?

FINAL

Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

Thanks Kevin and good morning everyone. As Kevin noted in his opening remarks, the Q3
large loss events caused significant damage throughout the affected regions and
continue to present wide scale humanitarian challenges. From an insured loss perspective,
these events combined to produce the largest single quarter loss in RenaissanceRe's 24year history.

Bloomberg Transcript

We recorded a net negative impact to our consolidated financial results of $615 million in
the third quarter of 2017. Recall that net negative impact includes the some of estimates
of net claims and claim expenses incurred, earned reinstatement premiums assumed and
feeded, lost and earned profit commissions, and redeemable non-controlling interest.
Included in the net negative impact for the quarter was $534 million associated with
hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria and the Mexico City Earthquake. It also included $81
million associated with aggregate loss contracts where cumulative losses under the
respective contracts reached the retention points during the quarter.
In an effort to provide transparent disclosures, we included aggregate losses in our net
negative impact figure for the quarter as they were meaningful to our results. Our best
estimate of losses from the large cat events in the third quarter will be largely responsible
for triggering losses under these aggregate contracts. However, the aggregate losses in
and of themselves are not necessarily attributable to a specific event in a traditional
sense. There remains meaningful uncertainty with respect to our estimate of losses from
the large cat events and the aggregate loss contracts, given the limit features and the
impact of our retro book.
At this time, I'd like to highlight a few metrics and give an overview of our financial
performance for the quarter. I'll then provide some additional details of our segment
results, our investment portfolio, and capital activities before I turn it back over to Kevin.
For the quarter ended September 30th 2017, we reported a net loss of $505 million or
$12.75 per diluted common share and an operating loss of $547 million or $13.81 per
diluted common share. On a year-to-date basis, we reported an annualized ROE of
negative 7.4% and an annualized operating ROE of negative 11.7%. During the quarter, our
book value per share decreased 11.6% and our tangible book value per share including
accumulated dividends decreased by 12%. On a year-to-date basis, our book value
decreased by 7.8% and our tangible book value per share including accumulated
dividends decreased by 7.3%.
For additional details of our quarterly and year-to-date results, I would refer you to our
earnings release and financial supplement, which we issued last night and can be found
on our website.

FINAL

Let me now shift to our segment results, beginning with the Property segment followed
by Casualty and Specialty.
Within our Property segment, gross written premiums were up 171% for the third quarter
of 2017 compared to the third quarter of 2016 and included a $165 million of
reinstatement premiums associated with the large events. Excluding the impact of
reinstatement premiums written in 2017, our Property segment gross premiums written
would still have increased 34% with our other property class of business up 64% and our
catastrophe class of business up 14%. The increase in our other property class of business
was mainly due to increased participation on a select number of deals and certain new
transactions we found attractive.
Our catastrophe line of business typically does not see major renewals during the third
quarter, but we were able to grow the book slightly including some backup covers while
exercising underwriting discipline given prevailing market terms and conditions.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our Property segment incurred an underwriting loss of $750 million and a combined ratio
of 323% compared to underwriting income of $103 million and a combined ratio of 40% in
the comparative quarter. The underwriting results in our Property segment were
dominated by the impact of the Q3 large loss events. These combined for $809 million in
underwriting losses and added 252 points to the combined ratio in our Property segment.
Overall, our Property segment performed as expected, following the occurrence of large
catastrophe events in the quarter. We continue to believe we have the right people,
systems, and strategy to execute through market cycles.
Moving onto our Casualty Specialty segment. During the third quarter of 2017, gross
premiums written were up 1% relative to third quarter of 2016. We were able to selectively
grow new and existing business within certain casualty lines of business. Mostly offsetting
this increase was a decrease in gross premiums written in our financial lines of business,
primarily the result of a large in-force multi-year mortgage reinsurance contract written in
the third quarter of 2016 that did not reoccur in the current quarter. With the growth we've
experienced to-date in the topline, we continue to execute on our gross to net strategy
having ceded out 32% of our Casualty Specialty premiums, given current market
conditions.
The Casualty Specialty segment incurred an underwriting loss of $43 million and a
combined ratio of 120% in the third quarter of 2017 compared to underwriting income of 9
million and a combined ratio of 95% in the comparative quarter. A key driver of these
results was the impact of hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria and the Mexico City
Earthquake, which drove the current accident year underwriting results in our Casualty
Specialty segment.
Positively impacting the Casualty Specialty segment combined ratio during the quarter
was a 7 point decrease in the underwriting expense ratio. Net premiums earned in the
Casualty Specialty segment during the quarter were $37 million and underwriting
expenses were relatively flat as we continue to leverage our existing expense base while
selectively growing this book of business.

FINAL

It is important to note that following quarter that saw the return of a number of significant
loss events, we continue to evaluate our reserves for developing trends and remain
comfortable with our processes and overall reserve adequacy.
Turning to investments. In the third quarter, we recorded total investment result of $82
million, generating an annualized total return on our investment portfolio of 3.4%. Included
in this result was net realized and unrealized gains on investments of 42 million and net
investment income of 40 million. Our equity portfolio continue to perform well during the
quarter, generating both realized and unrealized gains as markets delivered positive
returns.
Our net investment income was comprised mainly from our fixed maturity securities and
benefited from higher average invested assets, modest increases in interest rates and a
tightening of credit spreads during the quarter. Net investment income for the quarter
also included some unrealized losses in our cat bond portfolio, which was impacted by the
events in the third quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our investment portfolio remains conservative with respect to interest rate, credit, and
duration risk with 89% allocated to fixed maturities and short-term investments with a high
degree of liquidity and modest credit exposure. The duration of our investment portfolio
was 2.6 years and the yield to maturity on the fixed income and short-term investments
was 2.2% at September 30th, 2017 more or less flat compared to the end of last quarter.
Our strategic investment portfolio managed by our ventures unit again produced positive
returns overall for us and we continue to be satisfied with the long-term fundamentals of
the companies we own.
Now turning to our capital management activities during the quarter. Following a string of
significant cat events, it is a testament to our capital management strategy that our
balance sheet remains liquid and our capital position remains strong. Our access to capital
also gives us the flexibility to pursue strategic investments and capital management
activities as they may arise. Our ventures team continues to actively build relationships
with high quality long-term investors as well as looking for new strategic transactions that
can enhance our underwriting franchise.
Overall, our capital management actions reflect a quickly evolving market and we believe
we have developed a unique agility to deploy capital where it's needed most. Once
again, our trusted long -term investment partners and our joint venture vehicles
supported our efforts. They recognized the leadership we bring to the property cat
exposed market and immediately stepped up with an additional capital deployed. For
example, we quickly and efficiently raised $250 million of new equity capital in DaVinci
from third-party investors and Upsilon received additional funds to support its core
customers.
On the share repurchase front, prior to the arrival of Hurricane Harvey, we were active in
the market for our common share, repurchasing $39 million during the quarter, which
brings our total year-to-date purchases to $189 million.

FINAL

Our approach to capital management has not changed. With the potential for improved
pricing conditions in many of the markets we serve, we will first and foremost look to
deploy capital into underwriting and business opportunities that may need our risk return
hurdles.
At this time, I'd like to mention that commencing with our first quarter 2008 financial
supplement, we will no longer separately disclose the underwriting results of our Lloyd's
platform. We manage our business at a segment level and with the results of our Lloyd's
platform getting picked up in our Property and Casualty Specialty segments as
appropriate. As such, we will continue to provide what we feel is appropriate transparency
into our segment results and associated market commentary on our earnings call. From a
disclosure perspective, this brings Lloyd's in line with other locations and underwriting
platforms across our organization.

And finally before turning the call back to Kevin, I would like to extend our deepest
sympathies to all those affected by the devastating California wildfires. They resulted in
loss of life and caused significant damage to our major portions of the state. It is still very
early days for this loss with initial industry loss estimates ranging anywhere from 2 billion
to 3 billion to 6 billion to 8 billion and potentially higher. As we work through our initial
assessment, our early expectation is that given the complexity of these events, the
industry losses will come in closer to the higher end of published industry loss estimates.
There is significant uncertainty with respect to the nature and magnitude of these losses
and we will continue to monitor information from clients, industry participants, and other
sources as it becomes available.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call back to Kevin.

Kevin O'Donnell
Thanks, Bob. I'll divide my comments starting with Property, then Casualty and then we'll
open it up for questions. We broke another hurricane drought in the third quarter, this
time in US, landfalling major hurricanes. The last time, the last year a major hurricane
made landfall in the US was in 2005 with Wilma. This year, we had three, Harvey, Irma, and
Maria. We also had several large earthquakes including in Mexico City. Multiple hurricane
records fell in the third quarter such as experiencing 53 named storm days. In addition
and while not a record, there were five major hurricanes, including four that reached
Category 4 or 5 strength. This season was driven by warm waters and low wind shear and
otherwise near-perfect conditions for storm information.
As is typically the case, each of these storms had very different characteristics, hit
different risks and different geographies and will develop very differently. Unlike more
concentrated losses, such as the '04 Florida hurricanes, the Q3 large loss events will
affect the broad swap of the industry and consequently will have wide ranging impacts on
marketing conditions affecting primarily, reinsurance and retro, both in the US and
internationally.

Starting with Harvey, which made landfall in Texas on August 25th as a Category 4 storm.
This is really more of a flood than a wind event. While its wind field is relatively small,
Harvey jumped up to a record 50 plus inches of rain over a broad expanse Houston. To
put this rainfall on perspective, over 25 trillion gallons of water fell in Texas and Louisiana,
which is enough to fill the Chesapeake Bay. Harvey looks to be about a $30 billion industry
loss, which is around a 20 to 30 year return period for the Gulf region. Even though
Harvey is predominantly a flood event, the private market is exposed on both the
residential and commercial side, including a significant auto loss. So while this loss
primarily affects our property cat book, it will also affect our other property and casualty
businesses.

Bloomberg Transcript

Next up was Hurricane Irma, which made landfall on September 10th in the Florida Keys as
a Category 4 storm, then made a second landfall over Marco Island as a Category 3
storm. If Irma had tracked a handful of miles north, it would have not weakened over
Cuba. In all likelihood, it then would have made landfall on the heavily populated east
coast of South Florida as a Cat 5 rather than over the Everglades as Cat 3. This would
have been a true one in 100 event with the potential to cause more than 100 billion in
loss. Irma looks to be about a $25 billion industry loss, which is around 20 to 30 year
return period for the Southeast US. Irma is predominantly wind event even though there
was significant flooding. Average claim severity outside of the Florida Keys appears to be
relatively low and in many cases is coming in under applicable hurricane deductibles.
Finally, at least as far as hurricanes in the third quarter go was Hurricane Maria, which
made landfall in Puerto Rico on September 20th as a strong Category 4 storm. Maria
looks to be at least a $35 billion industry loss, which is a 100 plus year return period for
Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is located in the Caribbean. As a US territory, it will impact the US
reinsurance towers of many large US insurance companies. Due to infrastructure issues,
we expect that Maria losses will take longer than average to fully develop.
I often say that our value proposition extends beyond price and we had another
opportunity to demonstrate that again this quarter. As each of the quarter's hurricanes
was developing, our underwriters along with our team of scientists had weather predict,
closely monitored the storm, its potential for strengthening and the most likely track it
would take. Throughout this process, we made sure to reach out to those of our clients
and brokers most likely to be affected after the event. In addition to rapidly prepaying
claims, we were able to provide core clients, footprints of their portfolios run against our
proprietary industry database. The speed and skill of our people and our systems post
event is testament to our decades of experience in responding to events just like these.
Third quarter also experienced several large earthquakes, including Mexico City. This loss
does not appear to be as destructive as originally thought. That said, earthquake losses
are very longtail in nature and it's not uncommon to have significant development over an
extended period. We will be monitoring both Texas and Florida closely for signs [ph] of
assignment of benefits issues and other adjuster fraud. Today there's been little
indication that this has occurred, but there is still opportunity for fraud to begin to creep-in
later in the process. Insurance companies are acutely aware of this problem however and
are taking steps to identify and minimize fraudulent claims.

FINAL

We also saw a significant demand surge around adjuster fees. Due to the short time span
between Harvey and Irma, there is intense competition for loss adjusters, driving up the
fees insurance companies need to pay for their services. We're not a big driver of loss,
but it will result in increased loss adjustment expenses.
I'd like to briefly address how our independent view of risk incorporates the commercially
available catastrophe models and our expectations around the frequency of Q3 large loss
events. We spent considerable time and resources understanding the strengths and
weaknesses of the venture models. Consequently, all of the third quarter events were
within our expectations. These were not extreme tail events. For example, in Harvey, we
recognized the potential for significant flood losses and that this potential is not always
sufficiently captured in the models. In Maria, we understood the vulnerability Puerto Rico
faced major hurricanes and more of a tailwind, this loss was not surprising. This approach
is consistent with our aspiration to be the best underwriter as we believe that being so
results in superior shareholder value.

Bloomberg Transcript

In our Casualty segment, gross premiums written were relatively flat quarter-on-quarter
where we experienced strong net premium earned growth of 21% as our mortgage book
continues to earn through. We improved operating leverage in Casualty again in this
quarter with our operating expense ratio down about a percentage point. Our Casualty
segment also experienced losses from the Q3 large loss events, although to a lesser
extent than our Property segment and these losses primarily affected our marine and
energy books.
Overall, I'm pleased with the portfolio we've built in this segment. I take a long-term view
on the casualty business and recognize its benefits toward maximizing shareholder value.
As you know, margins on this business have been compressing and the team is working
hard to build the attractive positions focused on long-term value. Similar to our gross to
net strategy in Property, we see one-third of our gross premiums on this book, which
gives upfront profit to limit downside. This quarter saw the benefit of this strategy, as we
enjoyed significant retro recoveries, especially in marine.
We've been keeping a close eye on loss trends in the Casualty space. For example, we've
been under-weight in commercial auto and overweight in financial risk, which is consistent
with our strategy of constructing a portfolio that is more attractive than the market
average. Going forward, in addition to the business affected by the Q3 large loss events,
we anticipate that some of the more challenging areas of the market will adjust and the
positive trend in certain casualty lines will accelerate.
Casualty is a key aspect of our value proposition to our customers, who we believe want a
reinsurer makes a credible commitment to cover a wide range of their risks over
reasonably long time periods at consistent exposure based prices. Being able to provide
a suite of products beyond property cat is essential to this value proposition. Over the
long-term, I believe this business is accretive to shareholder value. Our ventures unit
continues to contribute both to our broader results and to our ability to execute our gross
to net strategy. Once again, for example, the strategic investments managed by our
ventures unit had positive returns this quarter.

FINAL

As Bob noted, we raised capital in our JV vehicle at October 1st. So DaVinci is fully funded
and ready to renew existing business and grow if opportunities presents. Also at October
1st, we were able to raise additional funds in our Upsilon joint venture to support an
attractive deal with a core customer. We are also ready to trade forward in Upsilon and to
the extent their attractive opportunities at January 1st, we will be in a position to transact.
The key aspect of our consistent aligned approach with our joint venture partners
appreciate is that they will have the opportunity to benefit alongside us in any market
opportunities in 2018. We currently have multiple offers to bring in new capital, but we will
remain aligned with our long-term partners. The third quarter was a great opportunity to
demonstrate to our customers that our value proposition extends beyond price and
includes many value added services both before and after large events. At January 1st,
our customers will also realize the value of trading forward with a long-term trusted
partner with unsuppressed access to efficient capital. In 2018, our hope is that rates will
adjust to the point where equilibrium is achieved, neither too low nor too high. Whatever
the future however, we have the platform, the people and the capabilities to continue our
leadership in the industry.
Thank you. And with that, I'll turn it over for questions.

Questions And Answers

Bloomberg Transcript

Operator
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Elyse Beth Greenspan
from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.

Q - Elyse Beth Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. My first question. I appreciate all the color around the hurricanes and
kind of the outlook, but Kevin what kind of price expectations do you have heading into
the 1/1 renewals and just how do you kind of see based on discussions with clients on the
pricing environment shaping up?

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

Firstly, 2018 prices going up. So I think the comments I made about there being a broad
swath of the industry affected. If you look at the insurers affected by Harvey is a different
pool of insurers affected by Irma and then again those affected by Maria are different. So
as you move further away from loss affected layers, it's always a little harder to predict
what will change and how much price will shift. When I think about price changes, I worry
less about the market and more about our strategy and I look back as to the way we've
positioned ourselves going into 2018.
As I mentioned we lowered our GAAP capital cost by refinancing our debt in our
preferreds. So we're coming in with in with the strong gap capital position.

Page 10 of 25

FINAL

Our economic capital model, which is the model that our underwriters use to deploy
capital were representing a higher cost of capital on our economic capital model. The
reason for the difference is because we've made different assumptions on the assumed
ceded retro supporting that portfolio. In 2017, the cheapest capital we had in our
economic capital model was the ceded purchasing that we did and we believe that that is
unlikely to be available in the same form in 2018.
So that's good news for us, because we had cheaper GAAP capital and we have higher
expected margins. So the spread between the cost of our capital and the opportunities in
the market is greater, which will inure the benefit of our shareholders. So while I'm less
concerned about the overall change in the market, I think the change in market pricing will
be reasonably broad. I think we have better access than anyone else in the market and
we have unlimited and unrestricted access to efficient capital to bring to those
opportunities.

Q - Elyse Beth Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. And then you know as you say that there is a better margin outlook, obviously with
your Casualty and Specialty business, the margins within that business have been in
excess of 100%, how do you think about potentially putting more capital towards your
Property and specifically, Property Cat business and maybe shifting away from Casualty
and Specialty business, if you know the catastrophe market does get a lot better?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

So I think, let me start just talking about Casualty, then I'll talk about the effect on capital.
We've had a few glimmers of hope in the Casualty market with some of our November 1st
renewals where we were seeing increased underwriting discipline and thinking about the
risk that's being assumed. I believe that in the Casualty space, we are not at long-term
sustainable margin, but I think about it over 10 years and in over 10 years, I believe we will
have sustainable margins.
I think there is two areas that will be focused on for pricing in Casualty as much of our
book is proportional, one is encouraging primary companies to continue to accelerate on
the rate increases for their insurance books, which will inure to our benefit. And the
second is thinking about whether the cedes are at appropriate long-term levels. A
reasonable confidence will have some rate enhancement on the primary books, I think it'll
take a little longer for us to have clarity as to whether cedes will respond favorably to
market pressures as well.
With regard to writing more Property or Casualty, if both are better, we will write more of
each. The capital allocation to our Casualty and Specialty business remains quite low and it
will continue to be low particularly if we find more opportunity in Property Cat, as Property
Cat drives the tail of the distributions. So on a marginal basis, our Casualty Specialty
returns still look quite good and the more property we write, creates more room for
Casualty and Specialty from a capital allocation perspective. So I think stand-alone returns
look better for both Property and we're optimistic about Casualty and Specialty. And I
think from a capital allocation perspective, we're in a very strong position.

Okay, great. And then where you guys surprised that within your cat bonds in your
investment portfolio only lost about 5% in the quarter?

FINAL

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

No. We would expect invents like this, cat funds to do take an impact. The losses that we
talked about were unrealized. You can see it in our supplemental where it was down
about 16 million and it was reflected in our net investment yield (inaudible).

Q - Elyse Beth Greenspan

for RenRe, for the quarter, how much of the cede was the third-party versus traditional

Q - Elyse Beth Greenspan

Your next question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Thank you and good morning. So the first question on return in capital market, the DaVinci
loss about $223 million and you raised more than that. So that will show you the readily
available return of capital out there. So would that impact the magnitude and duration of

Page 12 of 25



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td

potential price increases. I just wonder when you discuss with your capital provider for the
reloading, what kind of pricing expectation that you would deploy that capital?

FINAL

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

One thing, just for clarification, Kai, in the supplemental, the actual loss for DaVinci we
suppose is 255, 223 and you referring to is the non-controlling interest on the investors,
just for clarification, on page seven result.

A - Kevin O'Donnell
So kind of in layman's terms, we kept DaVinci the same size effectively facing the market. I
think about the capital raise in DaVinci kind of this business as usual to be honest where
normal process is at the end of the year the dividend back to investors the earnings and
then when there's an event we put capital call-out to refund the balance sheet back to the
levels it was prior to the events.
So I think from that perspective, we think DaVinci has good opportunities going into year
end, but we are -- it is a slightly different type of vehicle. So we're not doing a traditional
capital raise as one would expect with some of the more traditional collateralized funds.
This is people who have been with us for a long time, it's part of our normal process of
managing capital.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Yeah. And I think it's wondering is that, is that show a sign of broader appetite for risk still
from the our return in capital markets?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
So we consider DaVinci effectively to be closed. So we have, we do have substantial
interest in investors trying to get into DaVinci, but we had that last year as well. So I think
the appetite that investors have to see to take to share in our underwritten risk is high for
2018, but to be honest, it was hard very for 2017 as well.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. And then on your gross to net strategy, you have like two-third of your gross are like
recover from the retro market. I just wonder given the potential rising costs of the retro,
would you be able to maintain your gross exposure or grow that?

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

That's a great question. Yeah, absolutely. To maintain our gross exposure, we like the
gross book that we wrote. We like the network more, so we used the retro to enhance
and optimize the portfolio. As I mentioned in my comments, I think it will be as a split
between the retro that we purchase and the risk that we share is probably more accurate
way to think about it. We're about 70% of the risk that we share is with what I consider to
be long-term partners, 30% is more of a trading account. We have perfect elasticity as to
whether we renew the trading account and it will be very much price dependent. The 70%

Page 13 of 25



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2017-11-01

that I consider to be partner capital is capital that will participate in a better market in 2018
just alongside as like it did in 2017.

FINAL

So we are not subjected to the same client facing swings from retro as others because
we build our book to make sure that we had a consistent customer facing appetite and
manage our net risk through partner capital and trading capital.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Great. Last one if I may is on to your underlying loss ratio in the Property segment, it looks
like it increased a lot year-over-year. Just wondering is there particular sort of like non-cap
large losses, which is not including in your disclosure?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
I think you're referring specifically to other property within our Property segment. And I
think it's -- we provide other property as a breakout in the Property segment, because we
have a nutritional reserving component to that, which will be difficult to extract from
Property Cat only representation. But the other property and the Property Cat are highly
linked where much of the other property capacity that's put out is in conjunction with
Property Cat lines that are written. So when I look at the performance of that book, l
actually look at it from the Property segment perspective and I'm less worried about the
allocation of the loss ratio between other property and Property Cat.

Your next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar from Buckingham. Your line is
open.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Thanks and good morning. I like that name better. Just going back to the discussion on
capital management, obviously you opined that that you look at the market conditions and
then revisit and you were buying that before HIM [ph]. Based on the different renewal
cycles, I guess 1/1, 4/1, 6/1 et cetera, are we thinking of revisiting the capital management
discussion later in 2018 or would you be able to sort of come up with a thought process
after the 1-1 renewal.

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

There is couple of parts to that question. Let me start off with the comments in my
prepared text were as you pointed out, we're looking to deploy capital here in the fourth
Page 14 of 25



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2017-11-01

quarter as opposed to return in capital. And so we feel comfortable about our balance
sheets being fully capitalized and taking advantage of the opportunity.

FINAL

Regarding 2018 and return in capital, I think really it's what those opportunities early on in
'18 present themselves for opportunities to deploy capital, we can then look later on in '18
and what our decisions will be then.
The second question is really -- the second part of your question is really in the context of
how will that -- what will be the parity be between the returning capital and the rate
increases and there is a relationship there.

A - Kevin O'Donnell
I think our normal process is highly integrated between our underwriting and our capital
management. So you had mentioned the 1/1, 4/1, and 6/1 renewals. We've already
recreated our portfolios for the full expectation of price change for 2018. And that gets
periodically revisited, adjusting it upwards or downwards based on the assumptions we
have prior to each major renewal. That will ultimately inform whether we are allocating
more capital to the business or potentially looking to purchase shares back.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Right. The second question I had was, obviously you probably sounded a bit more
optimistic on the pricing equation than what I would have thought based on the industry
losses or percent of total capital. I'm curious, do you have a view on the overall industry
losses, is it sort of drifting upwards down as time progresses? I think a lot of us here are
somewhat scratching our head and trying to figure out the missing portion of the losses.
And I know that some of it is going into the alternative market, but even when you look at
the math, it seems that based on what we know today, the numbers are still not getting
there. So I was curious if you had an opinion on that.

A - Kevin O'Donnell
I share your confusion, it's kind of a highest level as to -- the disappearing nature of these
losses. The thing I would say is, if you look at our gross loss of roughly 2.2 billion between
what we prepaid and what's been reported, we're at about 10%. So there is a lot of
latitude as to how one believes they've been impacted by these events. So the fact that
we're at relatively low levels compared to what I believe we'll be close to 100 billion isn't
wildly surprising. Often in the period shortly after a loss, there is a wide gap and it tends
to close over time, but it does seem as if the gap is a little bit, potentially a lit bit bigger.
I think you touched on an important component here though is, there is usually a question
as to what the market opportunity, but going into 2018, there is a big question as to how
much capital is going to be there to support it. I think from the rated capital perspective,
most rated carriers are in on very solid footing going into 2018 and the lack of
transparency as to how much capital is impaired, how much capital is locked up from the
collateralized market is adding uncertainty to the overall loss estimate for the combined
events and also for the supply and demand dynamics going into '18.

Fair point. And then, a final question. I know there were some questions already on the
Casualty book and I know I have asked this before. In retrospect, do you think the Platinum
acquisition is achieving what you would have thought you would achieve on day one or has
it taken longer to get to the point what you would have outlet in your initial plans?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
We put out a list of objectives when we purchased Platinum. And I feel as if we made -we have achieved each of the goals that we outlined. I said then, I think the question is,
did we set the bar too low for what we hope to achieve. I think when I look at where the
company is and a lot of that is because of the benefit of us purchasing Platinum, I feel that
we're in a much stronger position going into 2018, because of our strong Casualty
platform than we would have been have we not executed on Platinum.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

FINAL

Hi, a couple of questions here for you. First one, Kevin, I am just curious, how much rate
do you think you need on the Property Cat reinsurance business, that's going to
meaningfully increase your net exposure without the benefit of cheap retros out there
that's probably not going to be there going forward?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
I think it's an iterative question. I think we will purchase retro. I look at 2017, we probably
had more income statement protection than we did -- than we will likely have in 2018. So
it's not that we won't have any trading account retro over those structured differently. So I
think again we'll look at the spread between our cost of capital and what we're paying -being paid for risk to make sure that's adequate.
If we are changing the way we're purchasing retro, I think the natural thing would -- to ask
is, what we're assuming more income statement volatility that must be in exchange for
something and that will definitely been exchanged for higher ROE in '18 because we'll be
taking -- one we will be taking more risk capital then exposing it and two, we will be taking
more income statement volatility because a lot of the retro we purchased in '17 was down
low.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Got it, okay. Well, maybe better way of saying that is how underpriced you think Property
Cat reinsurance is right now relative to your kind of cost of capital?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
So again, it's -- as a market or as our book, I don't feel as our book is underpriced. Look,
other way it's going to be again how we structure the portfolio. So we'll go and we'll
continue to rerun our portfolios every night, make sure we understand in how we're using
capital and on every marginal deal we understand whether we're enhancing or reducing
not only our existing margin, but the target margin we have for '18.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you. Okay, that makes sense. And then I'm just curious, again you kind of mentioned
you thought this was going to have implications outside of just the loss impacted areas if
you look back at the KRW [ph] and what happened in 2011. That didn't happen, so why
different this time?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
Two things, I will say. One is the cat market tends to react more to US events than non-US
events, that's just the nature of the beast. But actually more importantly, if you go back to
2011, rates were frankly much higher and there was less need for rate enhancement than
there is in 2017 where we've had several years of rate declines. So I think there is just
more of recognition that it's been a buyer's market and at least in the conversations
we're having with our clients, we're finding them receptive to the fact that we need to

Page 17 of 25



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2017-11-01

come to an equilibrium. We're not looking to push prices to higher we are getting to a
point, where margins are long at a better balance between the buyer and the seller.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

FINAL

Right. What (inaudible) better kind of parallel here, because rates were very cheap for
them?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
Yes. And we did actually see quite a bit of movement in KRW. I think --

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

They are outside the US.

A - Kevin O'Donnell

Bloomberg Transcript

Correct. So, as I said in my comments, I think as you move further from loss affected
layers it is more difficult to predict the rate change. I think in looking at our international
footprint on the primary insurance for cat is pretty low at this point because rates have
gotten to a point, where there's not much business that is sitting within our attractive
return profile. So I think we've got upside there. I'm not sure even with reasonable rate
changes it's going to attract us to write much more international. Most of the international
risks that we've taken over the last several years has come through our retro account, and
I do think retro rates will move pretty substantially both internationally and US.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

It makes a lot of sense. And another quick one here. So, the California wildfires, is that
going to be one event or multiple events for reinsurers?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
That's a question that is probably going to be figured out in the near-term. I think it's
pretty complicated there. There are wordings about the like consensus about how to
connect discrete fires to determine whether it's a single event or multiple events. There,
as we've seen before for retro it's probably one event. For insurance or reinsurance, it's
going to take some time to figure it out.
I think that loss is pretty complicated generally just to give some color on it. It's easy to
see the homes that are -- have been totally destructed, but increasingly we are hearing
reports of soil contamination and the remediation of that, and how that's going to be
handled could be additive to the cost. And then also the toxicity of the smoke damage to
adjacent buildings is becoming more of a topic of our insurers just to have their thinking
about remediating those losses. So there is uncertainty with that.
And then finally, there is a role potentially to be played by the utilities, as to whether they
are deemed to have been a source of ignition and that can increase the casualty
component of this loss, but also through segregation potentially lower the property
Page 18 of 25

Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2017-11-01

component. So I think we're monitoring all these things and trying to determine how its
ultimately going to play out, but there's still much to be answered about how this will play
through.

Q - Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Yeah, couple of questions. Some of the backup coverage that you wrote in the third
quarter, are those annual policies or are they for a shorter duration?

A - Kevin O'Donnell

Bloomberg Transcript

The more substantial ones, meaningful ones were short duration.

Q - Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

So we should think about sort of next year, third quarter being other than the
reinstatement kind of a tough comp from a premium standpoint, just from a modeling
aspect?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
I think that's accurate, unless we have a third quarter that looks like '17.

Q - Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Let's hope not. Second question, expense ratio, I assume some of the lower expense
ratio is due to lower bonus accruals?

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

Our expense ratio, look at the operational, I mean the acquisition, the acquisition ratios
are growing with the business. But on the operational expenses, two factors over time
have been driving that down. One is '16, you can see, we really effectively integrated
Platinum, so that doesn't exist on a comparative basis. And the other element of what
drop cost from like 140 -- high 140s to low 130s was just our focus on cost and trying to
leverage the platform that we talked about. And you saw that most notably in the
Casualty and Specialty.

Page 19 of 25



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2017-11-01

The corporate cost, last quarter, I think the question was asked, what's the burn rate
there? 4 to 5 and that's what we printed again 4 to 5 on corporate costs for this quarter,
which are down from one-time events last year.

Q - Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

FINAL

So you didn't change your bonus accruals in the third quarter because of these losses?

A - Robert Qutub

Bonus accruals are going to be determined at the end of the year in the fourth quarter.

Q - Jay Cohen

Okay. That's helpful. And then last question. Debt to capital, I guess debt plus preferred
to capital, do you have a target for that number?

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

Right now we feel very comfortable that well, I said earlier in my comments was that our
balance sheets are fully funded and we're ready to deploy capital into the coming year.
However, we see more opportunities we have access to capital, if we needed those
opportunities, proved even more significant.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Thanks. Kevin, when you were talking about your economic capital cost, you mentioned
that cost of retro is going up and that's not inconsistent with what we've heard from other
participants. Was the retro market underpriced last year or is there a new assessment of
risk?

Page 20 of 25



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td

A - Kevin O'Donnell

FINAL

So the comment I made is, we ceded 20% of our expected profit on 50% of our
premium. So I think one can make a determination, then may have a very different capital
model than we do, but that was not retro we would written for ourselves.
I think from looking into '18, I think what we purchased in '17 will not inform what we
purchase in '18. So I don't look at us as having a series of renewals coming up for the
trading account, but we look to construct the portfolio on a gross basis than optimize it,
one of ceded opportunities that we have that we either do or do not have. So I think it's
from year-to-year. It's less than an important comparison than it is in certain other launch
[ph] business.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

You mean from your perspective, not the market overall?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
From our perspective, correct. I think there are a fair number of -- others potentially rely
on retro to write their gross book. We are happy to write our gross book and rely on that
trading account retro to optimize the net.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. That makes sense. The second, I guess smaller point. That you talked about
demand surge for claims adjuster, I guess, particularly following Irma. Is there demand for
international like material costs or anything like that?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
I think less so than in other events. I think when you see something like more substantial
damage in broad widespread severe damage is going to be more demand surge. So my
comments are really thinking about Harvey and Irma for that. Puerto Rico, I think demand
surge is going to be extraordinarily important element of the overall loss. The difficulty is
getting materials there, the difficulty of moving materials around, the lack of infrastructure,
a lot of things that I think put a negative skew on how that loss can potentially there [ph].

Q - Meyer Shields

Your next question comes from the line of Ian Gutterman from Balyasny. Your line is open.

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Hi. Thank you. And Kevin I guess, first maybe, I went back and looked at '05 and '11 and
even Sandy and so forth and typically your market share on a gross basis, what was low
1%. And this time on a gross basis, you're low 2%. So it's definitely a much bigger share
than you normally take of a loss. Is there any story to that or is it just Southeastern
Caribbean wind, of course we have more exposure than foreign quakes or something in
the Northeast or has there been sort of a change in sort of how you position the book
post Platinum where customer (inaudible) we have more retro, we can take a bigger
gross share.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kevin O'Donnell
Yeah. I think we've never targeted 1%. I know it's a bogey that's used to kind of estimate
losses for us from time-to-time. So, there's been no structural shift in the way that we
closed the book. I think it is important that we do try to keep a consistent face to the
market and use retro to protect the net to optimize the portfolio so that we're not
transferring the pricing and the capital uncertainty to the customer providing certainty
there and then managing on our balance sheet. So I don't see it as a shift in anything that
we've done. I think it's frankly probably just a unique set of the outcome from a set of
aggregate losses in a quarter. There's nothing that I would point you to say, there is a
structural shift in the way that we've built the portfolio.

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Perfect. Just wanted to make sure. So the aggregate covers, can you give us a sense of, if
you were to see more gross development from -- basically we start to see sort of the
gap between the disclosed numbers in the 100 billion start to close, is there more to limit
left under those that could go against you?

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

So, yes, there is more limit left under some of those aggregates. I wouldn't point to those
as being particularly exposed to the change in the gross loss. I think we -- you went
through our normal process of top-down analysis to estimate the loss as well as a
bottom-up, so each of those aggregate contracts have been looked at individually and
we came up with our best estimate. Often our best estimate is significantly higher than
the customers' reported loss at this time. So I don't think we have uniquely different
exposure to those than we do to the current losses within each of the events.

Q - Ian Gutterman

Got it. And are those for named storms only or could the wildfires also get you on some
of those contracts?

FINAL

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

The wildfires, those contracts can't respond to the wildfires as well. So that's -- this is
more of a detailed point, but one of the reasons that not include the aggregates and
separate them out, this has new loss events occur. You can kind of forget time and then
take all the events over the contract life and a portion of the loss to them forgetting that
there's an occurrence retention. So as subsequent events can happen, it can actually go
back and adjust previous events to be lower, because some of the limit needs to be
moved to the new event. So that could artificially filled in favorable development if they're
not disclosed separately and continue to be allocated to the events.

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

That makes sense. So on the top line I think as (inaudible) that's just a follow-up. The idea
that there seem to be a lot of missing losses and yeah I know that's always the case, but
it seems much more dramatic on this one right I mean arguably half losses are missing.
Are there things you see, obviously you can't see how other people are picking numbers
maybe some of your clients were -- who were telling you what they expect. But is there a
sense you have for what's different is it that reported are coming in slower and maybe in
the past, there was a heavier aspect of reported and that got us close during this time
you need to sort of put up more IB in our because the reporters were slow. I'm just trying
get sort of a decent story. I guess I get to hear one for why we have such a big gap?

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

Let me touch on each of the events and that get kind of an overall perspective. If we take
Irma, Irma has got the most traditional as a cat, it's broad coverage and reasonably
modest losses. So it's much more of a traditional type assessment as to what the loss will
be. As I mentioned in my comments I think with the Mexican Earthquake it's probably a
little smaller than what was initially expected. I think we are probably -- our scientists
believe that there's a higher chance because of where it's been -- the main Mexico City
Earthquake occurred, that liquefaction could play a role that always takes longer term
report.
Harvey is again much more of a flood event as we all know. I think with Harvey to watch is
to see if there are kind of large risk losses that emerge from Harvey that's probably been
little slower than expected. We're not saying some of those major risk losses emerge.
And then Maria is just a tricky one. So I think of all the ones where there is potential for the
biggest disconnect between was ultimately recognized on balance sheets and much
reported so far, it's probably Maria for the reasons I mentioned earlier.

So I think additionally when there's this many events in a quarter, it is very complicated to
come up with a net risk exposure. So even for us, across the events our retro programs
are largely shared. So as when first Harvey happened, you put your retro allocation
against that. Once Irma happens and you're doing an optimization between to Mexico,
Maria, you're doing optimization across four. So I think as thinking about it with the net
number reported and then having this many events it's going to be a lot of movement
potentially between the net numbers, but not necessarily as much on the gross
depending on how the ceded allocations are distributed.

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

That makes sense. So if I can throw a hypothetical out and let's say that you guys are
being conservative and everyone else is being as accurate as normal and therefore the
industry losses are just a lot less than we think, let's say, it comes in, it's only 50 to 60 not
90 to 100. Does that tells anything about the cat models, is it possible that cat models
just are over us and just like we got to use them underestimating most events, maybe
they've actually overestimated all three of these events and we need to have sort of
optional five where the cat miles went up, now the cat models need to go down. Is there
anything indicating this?

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

I think of the cat models different than the cat modeling firms making an estimate of the
industry loss. So when we talked about return periods for these events that's us going
into our model, making an assessment as to what we think the losses and then putting
return period on it. We think that's reasonably accurate. We may have industry loss
around, but the return period to industry loss ratio will be right. So I think they are
assessing the loss and even just take the wildfires. There's a big difference between what
ARR is reporting and what RMS is reporting, which I think is interesting knowing that
California is a pretty thoroughly modeled state. I think one needs to separate their
estimate of the insured loss to the precision one can extract from properly using the
model.

Q - Ian Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Got it, okay. And then just last one real quick is I know I'm not going to probably get to
change your disclosure on PMLs and catalysts or anything like that. But if I can maybe ask
in a more -- in a simpler way as a proxy, if I were to look at your last 10 years' cats and just
add them up and divide by 10 as a percent of EP or capital or whatever, is there -- is the
last 10 years unrepresentative of what you would expect for the next 10. I know the book
only shifts and you may be buying more retro or less or this or that but is that a
reasonable starting point for us or is there something you say no, that's just a terrible way
to do it?

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

I've never done that. You take a look at it. I think just very simply, much of the risk we write
has an expected loss lower than 10. So you would need a longer timeline in order to have
a better understanding as to how the book is exposed. So if I were to think about it, kind

of doing what I would a burning cost model to understand a cat book, it's -- I would tend
to buy as myself to a much more of sarcastic approach using a much more robust event
set in longer timeframes.
