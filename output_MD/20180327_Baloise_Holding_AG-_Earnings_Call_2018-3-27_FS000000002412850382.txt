FINAL

Thank you, Marc. Everybody, also a very good morning from my side. In order to have the
required time for questions and answers, I will be very brief and actually present our
results in a nutshell. One, we are very pleased, of course, with the 2017 results we have
achieved, the second highest result in the last decade. We are growing strongly in our
target segments, so clearly almost 3% in Non-Life and in the modern life products with
over 14%. We have achieved a very healthy margin in our improving Life business and
actually conﬁrm a very high level of probably in our Non-Life business.
We're only one year down the road in our new Simply Safe strategy and in the meantime
the three targets we have put forward to being one of the best employers reaching CHF 2
billion of cash into the holding and acquiring 1 million additional clients, we are well on
track with over CHF 400 million of cash with almost 120,000 new customers and in the
top 25 of the best employers.
We have a strong balance sheet asset. We have been able to generate over CHF 400
million cash and that is why we proposed to the General Assembly end of April to
increase our dividend substantially up to CHF 5.60.
That's I would say the highlights of the results in a nutshell. And I would be glad to open
up for questions-and-answers.

We will now begin the question and answer session. Our ﬁrst question comes from Mr.
Peter Eliot from Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead sir.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Three questions please. The ﬁrst one was on the cash that you
mentioned. I was wondering if you could just talk through the drivers of that higher
remittance ratio, whether there's any one-oﬀs there at all, because I guess when I looked
at your cash radar, you've got headroom under all of the, sort of four metrics that you
show there. So, I'm just wondering if you could perhaps mention the constraints there
going forward.
Secondly, you disposed a very strong solvency ratio. I guess we've all seen your chart in
previous Investor Days and stuﬀ where you've shown the sort of the volatility. So, I'm
wondering, perhaps if you could also just mention how volatile that ratio has been over
the last 12 months or whether you now feel like you're in a much more comfortable
position.
And then, ﬁnally, just on the Life result, if I compare slides 23 and 24 with the equivalent
ones from the half-year presentation, it looks like you've done virtually no reserving in H2,
but you've still strengthened the reserves and brought them down by an additional 5

basis points in the second half of the year. Just wonder if you could just explain what was
happening there. Thank you very much.

FINAL

A - Carsten Stolz

{BIO 6055047 <GO>}

Right. Thanks for your question. So, with regards to your ﬁrst question – and I will talk to
slide 9 if you want to have this in front of you. The strong cash remittance that we have
seen in 2017 that you see on the left-hand side is based on the continued strong cash
remittance from the Non-Life business. It has been strong in the last few years and was
always the main contributor to cash remittance for the Holding prior to setting this new
target. And you see that that this holds true also for 2017.
We have seen a much stronger cash remittance coming from the Life segment, and that is
due to several factors. One is the increased proﬁtability of the segment as such. You'll see
that the EBIT on the Life segment has picked up by 35%. We saw the proﬁtability of the
underlying Life segment has gone up.

Bloomberg Transcript

The second element that plays a role here is that in line with the development of the
solvency position, the increased solvency position on a Group level comprising all
business segments also holds true for the Life segment and therefore giving us more
leeway to actively manage the capital position on Life. So those are the two main drivers
that's enabled us from a Group perspective to remit more cash coming out of the Life
segment.
Now, with regards to your second question on solvency, I would like to draw your
attention to the slide 11. That is exactly the same slide that we've shown in half-year. We
have now indicated that at midpoint we have a solvency position of well beyond 200%.
And if you look at the lower left-hand side of the mosaic here, that even under stress
conditions we remain well above our internal risk buﬀer threshold of 140%.
So the solvency position has been and continues to be in a very strong position. Still, as
you know, there is some discussions around models, especially in Switzerland going on.
So, some volatility might come from there, but we are very conﬁdent on this level. And as
you've seen in the cash radar, the solvency part of the equation is not a constraint.
The – your ﬁrst question with regards to Life. Indeed, we have had less reserving needs in
the Life book in comparison to last year, most of which has already been done in the ﬁrst
half. So, your observation is in that context, correct. What we had to do is mainly to add
some reserves due to the regulation in Germany of the so-called [Foreign Language]
(00:08:31) – I don't know exactly the – that exact English translation, but its interest rates
and additional reserving need due to German regulation because of the interest rate
level. And this development, as you have seen this on page 23, mainly also was one of the
key contributors to the improved Life contribution from an EBIT perspective.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Okay. Can I just follow-up quickly on the ﬁrst question on the Life division in particular. It
sounds like you're guiding to stronger earnings going forward. In the past, you've sort of
Page 3 of 15



Company Name: Baloise Holding AG
Company Ticker: BALN SW Equity
Date: 2018-03-27

said more than CHF 200 million. Is it fair to say that the – you're now more positive than
that, that you're going to start to increase it a little bit?

FINAL

And sorry, very nerdy, but just looking at the embedded value report, it looks like the Life
division there only reported a paying of (00:09:30) CHF 28 million dividend. So, I was just
wondering what the diﬀerence was. Thank you.

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Correct. So, with regard to the CHF 200 million, that guidance has been made in an
environment that was diﬀerent to where we are now. And so, I wouldn't put too much
emphasis on this lower level threshold guidance that has been given in the context of the
Investor Day. The interest rate environment has started to be a little bit more positive. In
general, our positioning with regard to interest rate has been and continues to be
positioning for rising interest rates. I remind you that we are running with an asset and
liability mismatch of between one year and two years, which is favorable if interest rates
on continued basis would rise and that would then obviously contribute to higher
underlying Life earnings.
And so with regards to your second question on the embedded value report, I think I
have to look this one up and I would suggest that we pick this up between you and the IR
team later on if that's ﬁne for you.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Of course. Thank you very much.

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Good.

Our next question comes from Daniel Bischof, Baader Helvea. Please go ahead.

Q - Daniel Bischof

{BIO 17407166 <GO>}

Yeah. Good morning. A couple of questions from my side. First on Germany, could you
explain a bit more in detail which conclusion you have drawn from claims for you in
Germany? Are there any speciﬁc elements of mention? Is it again the natural lines
business? And also, how do you look at the 96% to 98% combined ratio target which
should be achieved in one or two years?
And then a couple of things on the Life side. So, ﬁrst, I'm interested to understand the
drivers behind the signiﬁcant improvement in the new business margin in Belgium. And
then on the risk result side, I think in the past you mentioned that the Group proﬁt is CHF
240 million proﬁt. Is that still a valid number? It seems that there you had a negative oneoﬀ in 2017.

FINAL

And then, just a last point. On Friday, you will be keen to hear more about the progress. I
mean, number of customers in year one was around 15,000. You mentioned it. But, I
mean, it's the ﬁrst renewals round. What were your main takeaways from this and also how
cheap or expensive was it to get these customers, I mean, from a marketing point of view?
These are my questions. Thanks.

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Good. Let me ﬁrst pick up the question on Germany. So, what we have seen in the second
half in especially November and December is that we have had a number of large claims
in a part of the portfolio that we completely were underwriting. So, it's a liability portfolio.
Beginning of 2017, we already actually cancelled the majority of these contracts. And
without these bigger claims in this liability portfolio, the combined ratio in Germany
would have been below 100.
At the Investor Day, we have announced our ﬁve-year strategy to take Germany back into
proﬁt. And, of course, we stick to that and we are clearly progressing as we have changed
substantially the content or the portfolio – the Non-Life portfolio away from the industrial
risks down by approximately 25% and growth in the retail business in Non-Life by almost
20% over the last two years. So, we are progressing. And with regard to the 96%, 98%
combined ratio, we are very convinced that we will reach this in the middle term.
I would leave the questions on Life for Carsten perhaps.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Carsten Stolz

{BIO 6055047 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you. So, your ﬁrst question was on the true drivers of the improvement of the
new business margin in Belgium. And there were a couple of drivers behind that. The ﬁrst
one was that we have provided lower guarantees in new business in line with the
underwriting strategy for Life business in general. Secondly, there have been operational
improvements in the Belgium operations. And thirdly, the business was operating in an
environment with a slightly increased interest rate. So these three drivers were
contributing – were the main contributor to the improved business margin in Belgium.
And your second question on the Life business part was your question of the risk results.
The risk results has beneﬁted in 2016 from positive one-oﬀs. There has been one negative
one-oﬀ in 2017. So, for the time being, we stick to the guidance that the risk results shall
lay somewhere between CHF 200 million and CHF 250 million as we said before.

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Maybe I should then pick up the question on Friday. As you said, we have announced that
we have won or acquired over 15,000 new customers in 2017 with Friday. The changing
season in – or the car changing season in Germany is always the period NovemberDecember, so the heat will come up by the end of this year. We are still continuing to win
on a monthly basis new customers at the rate we were expecting.
In terms of how do we acquire these customers, you could say it's a mix of – on one side,
almost half of it is direct that goes by the direct channel, online, mobile, and so forth; the
Page 5 of 15

other half comes via partners and one bigger aggregate, the (00:15:57). The marketing
costs that we have planned in 2016 are slightly – the actuals are slightly below what we
had planned for. So, it's completely in line with the plan.

Q - Daniel Bischof

{BIO 17407166 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Thank you very much.

Operator
The next question comes from Jonny Urwin, UBS. Please go ahead.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Hi there. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just three for me. So, ﬁrstly, just
on the cash remittances, I remember from the Investor Day that you guys mentioned the
CHF 2 billion cash remittance target would most likely be delivered a bit back-end
loaded, but this doesn't seem to be the case actually. You're tracking in line already. So,
does this mean that you're getting out more cash from perhaps the Life unit and also from
Germany than you expected at this stage? That's the ﬁrst question.

Bloomberg Transcript

Secondly, on Germany, so, obviously, these liability issues have recurred. You cancelled a
lot of policies in 2017. I believe there are some more to be cancelled in 2018. Do you think
we'll see an end to these German issues in 2018? Are we closer to the turnaround being
achieved?
And ﬁnally, on M&A, can you give us an update on markets and lines that you'd be
interested in bolstering? I know you reported Generali Belgium (00:17:29) but that seems
to have gone quiet. And just in terms of the ﬁnancial capacity for M&A, I remember you
issued the hybrid in 2017. So, I guess you've got capacity if something interesting comes
along. Thank you.

A - Carsten Stolz

{BIO 6055047 <GO>}

Okay. So, I take – I'll answer your question on cash remittance. We are very happy with
what we have achieved in 2017. And to be honest, it's also a reward of many things that
you cannot see from the outside. We have worked internally a lot on gearing and
managing the fungible parts of capital in an active manner. And so, the – if I can talk to
these ﬁgures today, and I do it also as a representative of all the internal teams who have
worked on this. And that's, on a sideline, is important to me to mention that because it's
much, much more than just a graph on PowerPoint.
But apart from this, and coming back to the substance of your question, yes, we have
gone quicker than we initially expected. The bigger contribution from Life and the ability
to release capital from Life dividend payments to the Holding has signiﬁcantly contributed
to that. And therefore, we are well on track with regard to delivering these CHF 2 billion
that we have promised on the Investor Day.

So, with regard to Germany and M&A...

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Yes.

FINAL

A - Carsten Stolz

{BIO 6055047 <GO>}

...I'll hand over to Gert.

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Thank you, Carsten. In terms of Germany, if you look at the strategy we announced at the
Investors Day in October 2016, it was clearly that we are working on shifting the Non-Life
portfolio away from the bigger industrial risks into the more proﬁtable retail and SME
business. And that is exactly what we have done; we have also, in 2017, as you mentioned,
we have actually – we have canceled for about CHF 14 million of contracts. And despite
this, the sanitization round or this completely re-underwriting round, we have still grown.
And that is thanks to the growth – high growth of about 17% in the retail business.

Bloomberg Transcript

The liability portfolio is of course a long tail portfolio. That means that although we have
canceled in 2017 the 75% of this portfolio and we will cancel by the end of 2018 the rest,
it's still long tail, so it has – it implies some volatility in there. However, as said, we are
convinced that we will deliver against what we have promised on the Investors Day, and
we will achieve this 96%, 98% combined ratio range in the midterm.
On M&A, maybe two things on M&A. One, we keep – we are always – and that's always
been the strategy, we are interested in opportunities that come along in our four
countries, and we always actively look at them. Two criteria are decisive. One is, of course,
the business case and the other one is the cultural ﬁt with our Group. So, we continue to
look on opportunities that come along.
Alternatively, and I think that's also very important to mention, besides the classical M&A
transactions, you have the alternative business models in which we are clearly investing
with a lot of digital initiatives for operations with startups, collaboration with partners,
building new ecosystems, MOVU, FRIDAY, Mobly. So, we have – beside the classical M&A,
where we are always interested in, we are heavily investing and successfully so in these
alternative business models.
In terms of the hybrid, I'll hand over back – hand over to Carsten again.

A - Carsten Stolz

{BIO 6055047 <GO>}

So your question was around the ﬁnancial – ﬁnancing capacity that we have. And I think I
can say that we have full ﬁnancing capacity for ﬁnancing ideas that might come up, as
Gert said, be it classical M&A or is it adding optionality for the digital investments. So we
have the full spectrum of ﬁnancing instruments at our hand ranging from cash
transactions through senior bonds, through hybrid transactions, all the way through

Page 7 of 15



Company Name: Baloise Holding AG
Company Ticker: BALN SW Equity
Date: 2018-03-27

equity if required. So, ﬁnancing will not be a boundary for value-generating business
ideas.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

FINAL

Thank you very much.

Operator
The next question comes from Michael Huttner, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you very much. And I apologize if some of these questions were asked. I came on
the call a little bit late. I think I have four. The ﬁrst one is the German claim, fees, liability,
large claims, are they in the 2.6% large claims ratio? The second, on the topic of one-oﬀs,
should we expect something more? I think I read this morning, Germany cleanup; should
we expect something similar for your remaining two small countries, which are Slovakia
and Chechnya?
On the deal capacity, I'm not sure if you answered, but now your solvency is like strong or
even stronger than some of the reinsurers I follow. Can you maybe give a ﬁgure what
would be an ideal range or the level of excess capital you regard overall? Then on the –
my last question is on the Life side. In the past you've said that if interest rates rise, you
would be able to release some of the reserves which have been put aside for low-interestrate risk. And I just wondered if you can discuss that a little bit and also say if such reserve
releases would count as cash. Thank you.

A - Carsten Stolz

{BIO 6055047 <GO>}

So with regard to your ﬁrst question, those claims that under our deﬁnition are large
claims which are claims above CHF 3 million, are taken into consideration in these large
claims load that you see on the slide. There have been other claims that are below this
threshold and they are not taken out. So it's a question of how you deﬁne large claims
which is above CHF 3 million in our case. If you would exclude the eﬀect that Gert alluded
to earlier on the call, then the overall combined ratio of Germany would have been below
CHF 100 million.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Understand, but I was trying to see – you showed a picture, both in country and at Group
level. In the Group level, you show this large claims ﬁgure which doesn't seem to have
changed. So, my question is really the one-oﬀ – and regardless of the one-oﬀ which we're
seeing in Germany, so that also adjusts rates in your large claims ratio which you
published. And so I didn't understand your question – your answer, because you said
something about CHF 3 million, and I don't know if the claims in Germany were above or
below CHF 3 million. I don't have that data.

A - Carsten Stolz

{BIO 6055047 <GO>}
Page 8 of 15



Company Name: Baloise Holding AG

You cannot make this assessment in writing (00:25:28), but there were claims in this – in
these claims that were above CHF 3 million, so they are taken into consideration than
others who have been below. So part of the issue was, take (00:25:42) – which Germany
set out (00:25:43) would also be reﬂected then in the last claims load.

FINAL

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Carsten Stolz

{BIO 6055047 <GO>}

Then your second question was...

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Slovakia and Chechnya.

A - Carsten Stolz

{BIO 6055047 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, with regard to the one-oﬀs. The one-oﬀs that have taken place in 2017 were one-oﬀs
in relation to streamlining the German business and lead-entity structure. So, it was
intended strategic moves by exiting businesses that we wanted to exit for example
(00:26:24). And these yields have been done in 2017 and that created these one-oﬀ
eﬀects that are accounting eﬀects, not fresh (00:26:36) eﬀects.
So, in comparison to other things that you alluded to like Chechnya and Slovakia, on a
much, much smaller level – and I wouldn't expect similar eﬀects as we've seen with
(00:26:57) and others that we've seen in 2017. So, the short answer is I wouldn't expect
similar one-oﬀs coming from this transaction.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Carsten Stolz

{BIO 6055047 <GO>}

Then your third question was with regard to deal capacity or ﬁnancing capacity and
excess capital position. I mean, our calibration and the way we use the blue color is that
we say that everything that is above 140 is in line with what we consider to be a solid risk
buﬀer on a Group level
We already talked about putting volatility in these numbers, so I'm certainly cautious on it.
But with the current structure of the strength of the balance sheet, I feel comfortable and I
think deal ﬁnancing shouldn't be an issue from that perspective because it ﬁrstly starts
with the attractiveness of the deal and debt ﬁnancing follows.
And on Life, with regard to reserve releases in Life, I mean, we've seen now a slight
pickup in interest rates for the ﬁrst time since long. So it will take some time until this is all
digested, and then at some stage it might reverse or starting to reverse. But, I mean, these
are not directly cash eﬀects. So with regards to distributing solvency capital, we still need
Page 9 of 15



Company Name: Baloise Holding AG
Company Ticker: BALN SW Equity
Date: 2018-03-27

to go back into the tangible perspective on capital, and that brings us back to the cash
radar. And once this higher solvency position translates into a stronger balance sheet and
this translates into a higher cash remittance capacity, then the cycle will work. But overall,
the environment that we are starting to be in is a good environment for the Life business.

FINAL

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

And may I just add, remember you said on the cash ﬂow that the very good number you'd
achieved in 2017, the CHF 416 million, partly reﬂected – well, it reﬂected lots of work, and
you said, thank you and really well done. Should we consider some of that to be kind of
special work so that – somebody else earlier said well, cash ﬂow, is it going to be J-curve
and at the moment it looks straight line. But maybe, do we have a very strong start and
could we have a small dip because some of these one-oﬀs have already been done?

A - Carsten Stolz

{BIO 6055047 <GO>}

Certainly, the remittance in Life was strong in 2017, but I don't see any reason why this
shouldn't be repeatable at the moment.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Lovely. Fantastic. Thank you so much.

Bloomberg Transcript

The next question comes from Iain Pearce, Berenberg. Please go ahead.

Q - Iain Pearce

{BIO 19522835 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just two quick ones from me. The ﬁrst one just on the
German claims. I understand, the sort of FX (00:30:27) claims development was in
relation to book of business that had been re-underwritten or was in the process of being
re-underwritten? Was under the impression that this sort of re-underwriting process had
largely been completed, so can I just get some clariﬁcation on if you still have books of
business in Germany that needs to be re-underwritten and if there will be any impact from
that going forward?
And then secondly, just on the SST, will there be any diﬀerence? Are you expecting your
SST ratio to look any diﬀerent once you start implementing the standard model for the
Group Life business in Switzerland? Thanks.

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Well, let me pick up the question on Germany. I think re-underwriting is of course a
continuous thing. So, we are continuously evaluating our portfolio and re-underwriting
and canceling contracts when we think it's required. Of course, we started when we
announced it at the Investor Day in 2016, it was a clear shift away from the industrial risks
into the private and the SME business, and we are still doing that.

Page 10 of 15



Company Name: Baloise Holding AG

Date: 2018-03-27

This liability portfolio we've been talking about that has generated unfortunately the 2017
bigger plans (00:31:31) has been canceled in beginning of 2017 for almost 75%, and we
will completely go out of this portfolio in 2018. But re-underwriting is of course a
continuous business and it never stops.

FINAL

A - Carsten Stolz

{BIO 6055047 <GO>}

So, your second question with regards to SST and the eﬀect of moving to standard model,
for the time being, we do not see any substantial impact coming from that because apart
from modeling, the second element of the equation is calibration of this model and
FINMA is actively working on these calibrations of the models as well. And in that context,
they also look into the European context. So, I wouldn't say that that this will be a big
issue for us, also because our starting point is well beyond 200%. But the ﬁnal outcome is
not there yet, but it's not a problem that keeps you awake at night honestly, not at all.

Q - Iain Pearce

{BIO 19522835 <GO>}

Okay. Cool. That's great. Thank you.

We have a follow-up question from Mr. Peter Eliot with Kepler. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you very much. So just one ﬁnal clariﬁcation – I mean two ﬁnal clariﬁcations on
Germany. Are you able to say what the reserve movements were? So, what the (00:33:15)
impact was from Germany? And secondly, I mean, I guess if I look at that 108% combined
ratio, I guess there are sort of three impacts in there; so the bad weather, the runoﬀ
(00:33:32) portfolio still dragging and then these additional large claims at this (00:33:38)
period. Are you able to sort of quantify (00:33:42) how we ﬂip it out? Thank you so much.

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Go ahead, Carsten.

A - Carsten Stolz

{BIO 6055047 <GO>}

So, the line was not very good at least on our end. Could you just repeat the ﬁrst one? I
got that you wanted to have some clariﬁcation on reserve movements, but the voice was
cut at some stage.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Sorry. The ﬁrst part was just in terms of what the runoﬀ – what the prior reserve of
(00:34:20) were in respect to Germany?

A - Carsten Stolz

{BIO 6055047 <GO>}

Okay. So, by and large, it was because the claims that occurred have been claims from
prior underwriting years. It has an impact – or had an impact on the German prior-year

loss development. I cannot say the ﬁgure as of now directly but it was impacted, of
course. So, overall, the impact was negative because it was, to some extent large claims
from prior underwriting years.

And your second question was with regard to the impact of the three components on the
108% combined ratio. I think we haven't disclosed speciﬁc impacts on bad weather runoﬀ
and for your large other claims. The only thing that I can reiterate is, if we would have
taken, especially the mentioned large claims out of it that Germany would have been – be
below 100%. And that's why we are going forward. We just reiterate our conﬁdence that
in the strategic cycle, Germany will be able to deliver 96% to 98% combined ratio.

The next question will come from René Locher from MainFirst. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - René Locher
Yes, and good morning, everybody. I would like to start just asking on slide 9, the cash
radar. We have now obviously CHF 415 million and you have – that's roughly CHF 8.60 per
share, if I got the right share count and was paid out CHF 5.60 out (00:36:21) to
shareholders. So, there's still CHF 3 per share remaining at the Holding level. And I
remember that you were kind of guiding that you have an extra dividend cash at the
Holding level. So, I was just wondering if you could give us a number, how much of extra
cash you have currently at the Holding level?
And then just – and we have the CIO on the corner. Still wondering whether if you could
give us a little bit an idea if there's something which, like you seen, like sleepless nights
(00:37:00), like when I look at slide 29, so the current yield is at 2.3%, and the
reinvestment yield is 2.1%. So, perhaps a little bit of a outlook going into 2018-2019. Thank
you.

A - Carsten Stolz

{BIO 6055047 <GO>}

So, I'll cover the – your ﬁrst question referring to the cash radar on slide 9 and your
observation that you've broken down to a per share level. Just as a reminder, the dividend
is decided with an up-only perspective. So, we move the dividend if we consider it to be a
sustainable move. The CHF 415 million that has been remitted to the Holding, a gross
ﬁgure, so we have to cover some Holding costs from that. We have to also cover the
interest rate payments that – for the outstanding senior bonds that are on a Holding level.
So, some of the cash remitted on a gross basis serves for serving this, and I think that's the
key drivers.

FINAL

If you look at the observation that you've made with regards to how much cash we would
like to have on the Holding, we guided in the past to 1 to 2 dividends that we would like to
have the ﬂexibility buﬀer in the Holding. But we already talked about having optionality
for digital (00:38:48) initiatives and/or M&A. So we want to retain some ﬁnancing
ﬂexibilities, both in times of – in terms of volume and timing, and that's how we design it.
But I think we are clearly in a blue sky and at least if I look outside the window the
environment is a concern, by the weather outside. So, that's the considerations we have.
But your observations with regard to the relation between cash per share and dividend
per share are absolutely relevant, absolutely. For the (00:39:31) Life if CIO, I'll hand it over
to Matthias who is wide awake.

A - Matthias Henny

{BIO 17600048 <GO>}

Good. Good. Thank you. Looking at page 29, I mean, we're very happy that we could
achieve reinvestment yields of 2.1% given the low interest rate environment that we're still
in. It's not too far below the 2.3% on the existing books.
I think it's been driven to a large extent by our signiﬁcant real estate investment that we
did in last year. So, if we are looking to 2018, 2019, that number might look a little bit
lower. On the other hand, we have higher yield now the ﬁxed income area. So, I would
say it gives a balanced picture, so more or less, I would expect a lot of change going
forward.

We have another follow-up question from Mr. Huttner from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Thank you very much for this opportunity. So just two playback (00:40:45) questions. The
ﬁrst one, I think Peter asked about the diﬀerent ﬁelds (00:40:51) the diﬀerence between
the MCV cash we see and the CHF 138 million that we see in your lovely cash radar. And
you said you will deal with it oﬄine. If you could deal with it oﬄine in a way that we can all
see that would be lovely, because it is of interest. And then the other thing is just to check;
I think the wording you used for Germany is to say that if you hadn't had large claims,
then the combined ratio would have been below 100%.
So a very rough math – and I know there's reinsurance and stuﬀ – I'm calculating that this
would be – eﬀectively, it's equivalent to CHF 70 million from large claims. Is that about the
right ﬁgure? And is the way to think about these large claims that indeed they were mostly
reﬂecting these canceled portfolios or industrial risks which you no longer have rather
than being weather, which obviously is a continuing exposure? Thank you.

So, your remark with regard to the MCV cash and cash on the cash radar, we make this in
the way you suggested. So we've addressed it before. We see each other on the sell-side
lunches or we do it in the context of the sell-side lunches if that's ﬁne for you.

FINAL

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Thank you. And Germany?

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

And Germany, actually if you look at the large claims situation, so the majority comes from
this particular liability portfolio and we have some additional large claims in car and in
accident. So those are the two main sources. But the number that you put forward is
indeed – in terms of the range is correct.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you.
