Presentation
Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

Ladies and gentlemen. welcome to this conference call on Sampo Group's January-June
2011 results. I'm Jarmo Salonen, Head of Investor Relations at Sampo, and with me here in
the studio I have our Group CEO and President, Kari Stadigh, Head of P&C Insurance
Torbjorn Magnusson, and Group CFO, Peter Johansson.
We will start with a few words from Kari, and after that, try to answer any questions you
may have. Before handing over to Kari, let me remind you that this transmission can be
followed on our website, Sampo.com, and a recorded version of the call will later be
available at the same address.
And I think that's all from me, and I'll now hand over to Kari for his presentation. Kari,
please?

Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Thank you. Welcome to the conference call on my behalf as well.
Sampo had a strong Second Quarter and reports for the ﬁrst half year a proﬁt before taxes
of EUR 756 million, up 22% compared to the same period last year. You have all seen our

numbers, and as they are good, and very transparent, I don't want to spend more time
looking at historical data, but instead, I would like to take a closer look at some Sampo
fundamentals, given the present turbulence in the equity markets.

FINAL

This time, distrust stems from the public sector, unacceptably high budget deﬁcits, and an
unwillingness of investors to continue to ﬁnance states at the rates they used to. There is
no trust in politicians and their ability to decide and implement corrective actions.
This is really not a crisis of the private sector. This is not a question of over-leverage in the
ﬁnancial sector or households.
In our main market, the Nordic countries, state ﬁnances are in a completely diﬀerent
shape. Actually, in a pretty good shape, compared to many other European countries.
Especially Norway and Sweden stick out as best in class, and as you know, two of our
main businesses, namely If Insurance and Nordea, are actually headquartered just there,
in Sweden.

Bloomberg Transcript

The volatility of the results of our P&C operations and Nordea are, and they were
throughout the previous crisis, lower than their peer groups. Always proﬁtable. For our
non-Life operations, we guide a combined ratio 92% to 94% for the year, and we have
really no reason to change that guidance, even if we see an increase in volatility in the
equity markets.
Nordea's fundamentals are the same. It is active in countries with a healthy
macroeconomic position. It has a strong, growing customer base, and reported a clear
decrease in loan losses. Nordea has also signiﬁcant economies of scale, and has just
shown ﬂexibility in adapting costs when it announced its New Normal plan. And last but
not least, Nordea has an excellent funding position based on its AA rating.
Mandatum Life has made well in advance signiﬁcant reserve strengthening, and brought
the discount rate to 2.5% for this year, and to 3% for 2012. In the present turbulence, we
can now enjoy the beneﬁts from these decisions.
The general investment market has been miserable for a while. We were net sellers of
equities in our insurance operations during the spring, and have now very cautiously
started to buy small amounts of equities, mainly Nordic names that we know and feel that
they are, in our opinion, oversold. Nothing really dramatic, but this is a moment to act.
We have also decided to start share buybacks of our own share. Given our strong capital
position and stable cash ﬂow, I hope the present turbulence opens good opportunities
for our investment team to act.
I think that's all this time that I have to say.

Questions And Answers

FINAL

Operator
Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) The ﬁrst questions come from the line of Per
Groenborg. Please go ahead with your question -- announce your company name and
location.

Q - Per Groenborg
Yes. Good afternoon. It's Per Groenborg from Danske. I have three questions, the ﬁrst one
related to the market meltdown which you are addressing yourself. My question is, are
there any hedges we cannot see? Have you taken any actions besides what you are saying
now, that you have started to accumulate, or should we assume that as the end of Q2
balance sheet, you have run into this (meltdownward)?

Bloomberg Transcript

My second question is for Torbjorn, related to the P&C volumes. We're starting to see
quite nice growth in Finland, but what's happening volume wise, especially in Norway,
where it looks like in local currency, it's been trending downward? Are we seeing any light
at the end of the tunnel in Norway?
And my third question may be a bit tricky. You have announced the buybacks today.
Should that be seen as a signal that you ﬁnd your own share more attractive compared to
adding additional to your stake in Topdanmark, that now is trading some 20% below what
you last have paid for shares in Topdanmark. That was the three questions. Thank you.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Well maybe I start with Topdanmark, because that's the easy one. I don't think that we can
buy any volumes in Topdanmark that are of any signiﬁcance. And of course, our policy
towards our shareholders has always been that we are a dividend stock, and on top of
that, we are willing to do share buybacks when we feel that it increases our share -- the
shareholder value.
So I think you are comparing apples and pears there. They are not the same stuﬀ. Let's
stick to Sampo share. It's much more interesting for us.
On the market meltdown, I think that that's just a word which has caused this behavior. I
don't expect to see a meltdown. When we had the Lehman crisis, I think that when you
worked in the ﬁnancial sector, you could see signs of meltdown in certain areas of the
globe, or in certain countries. This time, I think this is a crisis of the public sector, and I
expect to see prolonged slow growth. But I don't share the view of the market, of a
meltdown scenario.

Page 3 of 12



Company Name: Sampo Oyj
Company Ticker: SAMPO FH Equity
Date: 2011-08-10

FINAL

And of course, that is the reason why we are announcing a share buyback, and we are
also gradually starting to buy equities, even if we have been net sellers during the spring.
So I don't see a meltdown scenario as that probable. If there were a meltdown, against
our belief, our strong capital position, of course, gives us a position to sustain that, but I
don't feel it's at all probable. I think that we are now in the lower quartile of equity values.
I don't know, of course, where we are there, but we are deﬁnitely in the lower quartile,
and now, if we start gradually buying shares, I think that we will see that this is a good
investment stance.

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

Per, this is Peter, on the question on hedges. So basically, you can look at the sensitivity
table, so if there are any hedges, it's reﬂected in the sensitivity table.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Finally, volumes, Per, just as you, I think I am pretty problem-oriented, and try to solve
problems. But let me just for one second be a bit upbeat, and say, yes, we have growth in
Finland. Yes. We have growth in Denmark, more than 10%. Yes. We have growth again in
the Baltic countries. Yes. We have growth in our car dealer and trade union agreements,
and actually, our Internet site is also very successful at the moment.

Bloomberg Transcript

So the overall picture, as you can see, is good. In Norway, we actually do have growth,
albeit less than in the other parts of the organization, and it is a tough market.
There is one light in the tunnel, though. In the last quarter, the Norwegian FSA has ruled
that the cross-subsidizing that the banks, and particularly, DnB Nor does, is too big to be
allowed in the Norwegian market. So that is, we expect that to be decreased, and that will,
of course, help us a lot in these markets.

Q - Per Groenborg
(inaudible), thank you.

Operator
Our next questions comes from the line of Vinit Malhotra. Please go ahead, announce
your company name and location.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes, hi. Good morning, (inaudible), Vinit, Goldman Sachs. Just two or three points here.
Firstly, I remember Torbjorn talking about the EUR 38 million (inaudible) in 1Q looking
rather high at that point. Then you again had a quarter with a similar number, if I can see
here. If you could comment on that, it will be great, because in this quarter, it doesn't look
like it's coming from the one-oﬀ industrial kind of lines.

Page 4 of 12



Company Name: Sampo Oyj

Date: 2011-08-10

FINAL

Second thing is, in the Norwegian Commercial, you seem to have -- your comment
suggests that it's not going very well over there. Any feedback there on that, for the (P&C
ﬁgure?)
And the Life, I do remember there was a conversation around how 1Q '10 was a very
tough quarter, because of a large one-oﬀ transaction. But again, we have seen some
volume pressure. Now, at least one or two years ago, the main thing was that Life was
getting -- was generating very strong investment returns, and still attracting volumes
again. Is there something going on here, because the (unit linked) market share also
keeps going down. Is it (inaudible), or is it just banks competing for the customers' wallet?
So that's the three things, really. Thank you very much.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Maybe I start with the Life question, on market volumes. Sampo was -- or, Mandatum Life
was maybe the ﬁrst to introduce capital redemption policies, and they used them as
wrappers for good investment ideas. I think that one reason for the decline in growth has
been that there hasn't been that many good investment ideas to sell to the customers, as
historically, we have mainly been now selling active management of portfolios, but no real
themes. And always, when you have themes to sell, you sell more aggressively. That is
one reason.
Then the second reason is that our colleagues in the industry have now also started to buy
-- to promote capital redemption policies, and therefore, market share has declined,
because they start from very low numbers.
As you know, we don't target any volumes, so -- market share volumes. So First Quarter
this year was a disappointment to us, but the Second Quarter was already according to
plan.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Then on the reserve releases, we have, over some time, built up a tradition of conservative
reserving in the large corporate lines that I mentioned the last couple of quarters, and this
quarter is no exception. We have some reserve releases, but almost two thirds of that, just
as last year, came out of settlement of large losses where we usually win the settlement
and have a lower reserve in the end that we have reserved for in the -- at the beginning.
Norwegian Commercial, if I felt that that was not very good, I would sound a lot more
depressed than I do. We have a tough market. We have around about zero volume
increases. But the premium levels that we write are adequate, and the price increases that
we get through in the market are also adequate. So I have no reason to see a problematic
development of the combined ratio. I believe that we can keep the proﬁts where they
should be also in the Norwegian Commercial.

FINAL

Our following questions come from the line of Giulia Raﬀo. Please go ahead, announce
your company name and location.

Q - Giulia Raﬀo

{BIO 7573856 <GO>}

Hi. Good afternoon, Giulia Raﬀo from Autonomous in London. Just one quick question
ﬁrst, on numbers, one. I was wondering if you can conﬁrm that the If investment income
was depressed in Q2 by about EUR 89 million because of the eﬀect of the change in
accounting in Topdanmark.
Then my second question, regards to, if I compare the video and the statement that you
made in the call so far, in regard to the outlook for the year, and I compare that with the
line you put in your Q2 accounts I can see that the caveat that you put for extraordinary
items doesn't seem to be concerned. Is that fair? Because I think -- you know, you put it
there, it's the ﬁrst time that's the (convert) is there. But you sound very, very conﬁdent, and
clearly decide that you are prepared to buy (10 million) share. Would make me think that I
shouldn't read too much in that caveat.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

You read me correctly. The caveat is there just for the auditors, and as a safety. I am -- I
have no reason to take it any more seriously than I do.

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

And Giulia, on the investment income, the EUR 89 million, that's the accounting change in
Topdanmark.

Q - Giulia Raﬀo

{BIO 7573856 <GO>}

So it's correct that -- as you note the change in accounting, your investment income in
P&C would have been EUR 89 million higher, and your pre -- proﬁts before tax would
have been roughly -- because 90 minus 3, would have been higher.

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

Yes. The gross investment income in If P&C, and the accounting change was done in May.

Q - Giulia Raﬀo

{BIO 7573856 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you.

The next questions come from the line of Gianandrea Roberti. Please go ahead with your
question -- announce your company name and location.

FINAL

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. This is Gianandrea from Carnegie. I have four very quick questions,
if I can. The ﬁrst one, maybe it's only technical, maybe I'm missing something. But on the
buyback, why is it that you can only start it on August 24? I'm -- I would have thought that
you could start this straight away after the numbers. But if you can just explain me that
one, that would be great.
Then the second one, the fair value reserve in non-Life is down quite a bit on the quarter.
I'm just trying to ﬁgure it out if it's me, that I've been too optimistic ahead of the number,
or if you had some sort of hit on some speciﬁc stocks that you can share with us, or you
see all normal there.
Then in non-Life, two things. There is (inaudible) and some alliance in its Swedish business
continue to release an enormous amount of -- continue to book enormous amount of
reserve releases quarter after quarter, and it looks like mainly in (children) insurance in
Sweden. I was wondering if you, Torbjorn, have an idea what's going on, or what is your
presence in that segment.

Bloomberg Transcript

Then secondly, if you can, remind me how much of claims handling is done by Internet in
the diﬀerent countries. I think it's around 40% in Finland in the (inaudible) line, but I was
interested in the other countries as well. Thanks.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Maybe I start with the compliance issue. We cannot start until 24th of August because we
have the pricing of the incentive system in the Group going on, and it's not prudent to do
share buybacks when the pricing is out. So it's a pure compliance issue. The shortest time
we could do it is, if this was not the case, in a week. There is always a moratorium for at
least ﬁve working days before we can start.
So we got ﬁve extra days thanks to this, but this is not material.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks.

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

And Gianandrea, on the second question, on the fair value of reserve in equities in Top, so
that is really, explain why the accounting change in Topdanmark.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

That's the most of the things, really, nothing else?

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

Yes, yes. That's the big item, yes.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Starting with the Internet, then, claims handling in Finland is about 45%, Sweden between
20% and 25%. Norway, I think, is 10% to 15%. Denmark is a number that I can't recall oﬀ
the top of my head at the moment. Probably similar to Sweden.
What RSA -- and of course, these are claims notiﬁcations, and then there will be an e-mail
conversation sometimes, and sometimes the customer can actually settle the claim
himself entirely over the Internet.
RSA, in Sweden, have released, I think, about EUR 300 million in reserves over the past
three years. That's from personal accident and motor third party, according to their ﬁlings.
We have looked at that with some interest, and of course, I have no idea what lies behind
it. We have no similar numbers in our organization at all.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Thanks a lot.

Operator
Our next questions come from the line of Hans Pluijgers. Please go ahead -- announce
your company name and location.

Q - Hans Pluijgers

{BIO 16245530 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon, gentlemen. It's Hans Pluijgers of Cheuvreux. And actually, two
questions, if I may. First of all, on Norway, the impact from the ﬂooding, I understood was
about EUR 5 million on your claims ratio, but you saw a bigger increase in your combined
ratio year on year. Could you give some feeling what the other (hypes) were there for
driving this combined ratio year on year?
Secondly, on the equity portfolio, could you a little bit, make it -- give some feeling,
because since the end of June, the equity portfolio -- the equities in most of your markets
has been down about 20%, looking at your, actually, breakdown of your portfolio, on
page 34 of the presentation. Could you look at, say, ﬁrst, also a feeling how precisely your
impairment policy works? I understand it's gone down 20% below the purchase price.
And you really have to take an impairment. But it's for a longer term, below a certain level,
how -- what level is that, before you will take a charge? I assume it's about nine months,
but what level you're going to take a charge?

Page 8 of 12



Company Name: Sampo Oyj
Company Ticker: SAMPO FH Equity
Date: 2011-08-10

And also, look at the current share prices. Do you expect, based on current share price,
any impairments, major or signiﬁcant impairments in Q3?

FINAL

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Increasing in Norwegian combined ratio, we had -- last year, we had reinsurance
recoveries after the winter, and a much better loss -- large loss outcome. That's the main
explanation. The combined ratio is, of course, still below 90, so that's very satisfactory.

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

Second question, on the equity portfolio, so the change in the investment, how we report
the investment portfolio, that's now excluding Topdanmark again.

Q - Hans Pluijgers

{BIO 16245530 <GO>}

Yes. But currently, you have 70%, let's say, a positive (inaudible) still in your equity
portfolio. But currently, the share prices, on average, looking at your breakdown of your
portfolio, about 70% also down, compared to the end of June. So that imply that any risk
that you should take, any major impairments, already, on that portfolio in Q3, based on
current share price. So could you give some feeling on that?

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So basically, you can -- if you look at the equity investments, we did impairments around
EUR 21 million in Q2 in the Life company. And I don't think there was any -- or if there was
any impairments in the P&C operation, they were insigniﬁcant.
Then Q3, I would say that your guess is as good as mine. You can look at our sensitivity
table on equities, but what will happen in the market?

Q - Hans Pluijgers

{BIO 16245530 <GO>}

Okay.

Operator
Our next questions come from the line of Matti Ahokas. Please go ahead, announce your
company name and location.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. Matti Ahokas, Handelsbanken, Helsinki. Couple of questions here as
well. Firstly, regarding the weather, in the Third Quarter, we've had a pretty tough weather
in the Nordic regions, especially in Denmark, but in other places, regarding the storms.
Has this had a material impact on the claims in the Third Quarter so far?
The second question is regarding the buyback as well. Can you conﬁrm that the buyback
and the dividend are totally uncorrelated, and the buyback is just an additional thing on

Page 9 of 12



Company Name: Sampo Oyj
Company Ticker: SAMPO FH Equity
Date: 2011-08-10

top of the buyback, so we should not expect that this would, in any way, impact the
dividend payout of -- for 2011?

FINAL

And the third one, just a detail question. Was it so that it was EUR 21 million of reserve
releases or prior year gains in the Industrial division in the Second Quarter? Thanks a lot.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

On the buybacks, Sampo is a dividend stock. The -- it's a Board decision, what dividends
are, but (inaudible), as you are well aware of, the management loves track record in
dividends. Yes. This is on top of dividends, the share buybacks. They don't inﬂuence our
dividend capacity, and nor decisions.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Then on weather, in Q3, weather in Copenhagen was troublesome on the 2nd of July. We
have present estimates of that to be EUR 10 million to EUR 15 million, which is, of course,
less than what we can have in one large loss, and in fact, less than we had in the summer
storms in Finland last year for Q3. So that is business as usual for us.
EUR 21 million seems to be right. I don't have the number in euros, but that's roundabout
right for the Industrial in Q2.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Great. Thanks a lot.

Operator
(Operator Instructions) The next questions comes from the line of Peter Eliot. Please go
ahead, announce your company name and location.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thanks a lot. It's Peter Eliot from Berenberg. Three quick questions, if I may. I'm sorry if the
ﬁrst one is partly going over ground covered, but my ﬁrst question to start, but just on the
share, the share buyback, in terms of the timing on that decision, am I right in
understanding that it's basically driven by your view of the value of your shares, and that
this is the right time to step in, or is there anything else going into that decision?
Secondly, on your stake in Topdanmark, I think I'm right in saying that you haven't
participated in Topdanmark buyback to date. Are you able to say anything on your
approach to Topdanmark's buyback going forward, whether or not you might participate?
Then thirdly, very quickly, a numbers question. On the -- I was -- the ﬁnancing costs in the
holding company came in slightly lower than I was expecting. Are you able to give us
guidance on how we should look at those, going forward? Thank you.

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 3902189 <GO>}

FINAL

On the ﬁnancing costs, yes, it was slightly better, because we have also swaps and some
currency, open currency positions on the funding. So from quarter to quarter, it can
ﬂuctuate. We had slightly higher in Q1, if I remember correct. Yes. We had a slightly higher
-- and now it was slightly better in Q2. So there's some valuation movements.
But on average, the guidance is roughly -- because we have 3.5% funding costs, so that
you use around EUR 15 million to EUR 16 million. That's roughly the normalized.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thanks.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

On Topdanmark, we have nothing to do with Topdanmark's buyback program, except
that when we have been buying ourself Topdanmark's shares, we are well aware that Top
is not distributing dividends, and they are giving us an indirect yield through their share
buyback. So they have not communicated anything else. We assume that they continue
with oﬀering their shareholders this indirect yield, and our shareholding and their
buybacks are two completely separate issues.

Bloomberg Transcript

Then on our share buyback, you had a question. Now I already forgot it. But you -- what
was your question?

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

It was just in terms of the timing of that decision, whether that was solely driven by the
value you perceived -- you saw in your shares in the moment, or whether there was
anything else going into that decision.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Yes. When we do a decision on share buybacks, we have done this decision several times,
but we have very seldom been really successful. The only time when we were really
successful, when -- was when the Icelanders were selling down. Then we were heavily in
the market.
When we do the decision, it's -- you can really say that it's clear that we feel that it's a
valuation issue on the share price. Actually, in our business, it's so that many times,
because of compliance reasons, we are not able to buy shares back when we would like
to, because we are active in the market. And many times, there are insider issues. We
have something going on which stops us from buying.
This time, there is a window of opportunity for us to buy, and we executed.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks a lot.
