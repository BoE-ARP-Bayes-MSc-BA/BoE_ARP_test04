MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning or good afternoon. Welcome to Swiss Re's Full Year 2015 Results
Conference Call. Please note that today's conference call is being recorded.
At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Michel Liès, Group CEO of Swiss
Re. Please go ahead.

Michel M. Liès
Thank you very much. Good morning or good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to our
2015 annual results conference call. I'm here with David Cole, our Group Chief Financial

Officer; Matt Weber, our Group Chief Underwriting Officer; Guido Fürer, our Group Chief
Investment Officer; and Philippe Brahin, our, I should say, Group Head of Investor
Relations.
As you have heard this morning, I will retire from my position as Group CEO after more
than 35 years at Swiss Re and at the end of, I would say, a successful five-year target
period. I'm delighted that Christian Mumenthaler will become new Group CEO as from
July the 1. Christian has been a great contributor to the success of our group. He has a
deep understanding of our business and a rich experience to implement the group's
strategic framework we introduced last December.
To recap on 2015, let me give you an overview of the results we published this morning.
As you have seen, 2015 was another successful year for Swiss Re. We reported a
remarkable net income of $4.6 billion. All business units contributed positively to these
results. There was also a strong contribution for investment with the return on investment
of 3.5%. Our group capitalization remains very strong with an estimated group SST
solvency ratio around 205%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Property & Casualty Reinsurance maintained its underwriting discipline and delivered a
very strong return on equity of 22.2%. Life & Health Reinsurance met its 2015 target and
delivered a return on equity of 15.7%. Corporate Solutions focused on delivering on
profitability with a return on equity of 14.8%, at the upper end of its target range. Finally,
Admin Re reported strong gross cash generation and a return on equity of 7.5%, also at
the upper end of its mid-term target.
On the basis of our performance and strong capital position, the board will propose a
regular dividend of CHF 4.60, which represents an increase of 8.2%. The board will also
seek authorization for a new share buyback programme of up to CHF 1 billion conditional
upon available 2016 excess capital. These capital actions will enable our shareholders to
continue to participate in our success. Today, we also reported on our January renewals,
which represent more than half of our Property & Casualty treaty book, but less than a
third of our diversified revenue streams.
The market conditions remain challenging. And we will continue to differentiate our
offering through our financial strength, our expertise, and interactive client relationship
model. We remain confident about the underlying quality and long-term performance of
our books and confirm our group and business unit targets over the cycle.
With that, I'll hand over to Philippe Brahin, Head of Investor Relations, who will introduce
the Q&A session.

Many thanks, Michel. Good day also to all of you from my side. Just before we turn to the
Q&A, I would like to remind you to please restrict yourselves to two questions each and
register for follow-up questions, so everybody has a chance to ask a question. I would

also invite David Cole, our Group CFO, to guide us in conducting this Q&A. So, with this,
operator, could we please take the first question?

Q&A
FINAL

Operator
The first question comes from Xin Mei Wang from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Q - Xin Mei Wang

{BIO 20796577 <GO>}

Hi. Good afternoon. My first question is on the buyback. As of last year, it's dependent on
the availability of excess capital in 2016. I'm wondering how you look at that excess capital
because, I suppose, if I look at it, the 205% SST, that's comfortably above the 185% risk
tolerance level. Is it different to deployable excess capital or should we think about it in
relation to the previous message that a 200% ratio is equivalent to $3 billion to $5 billion
above S&P AA?

Bloomberg Transcript

And just to tag onto the end of that, you mentioned that the buyback will be launched if
no major loss event has occurred. What do you consider a major loss event? And would it
be something over and above the $1.5 billion nat cat budget? My second question is on
the growth in U.S. casualty. Given the interest rate outlook, I'm interested in how you see
the return on capital employed today compared to, say, one year ago or compared to
your pre-2007 levels. Thank you.

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much. Perhaps I'll take a stab at the first question and then ask Matt
to come back to the second question. So, let me just first speak very generically. So,
indeed, you see that our board will propose to the shareholders meeting in April this year
the authorization of a new share buyback programme similar with last year's request, also
for a one-year period up to a maximum of $1 billion. I think we've all have seen now during
the course of 2015 leading up to when we actually launched our current share buyback
programme, it's important how we communicate this to all of our stakeholders and
investors. So, a key message that I'd like to leave with you is our intent regarding the
newly to be authorized share buyback programme will operate very much in line with the
programme that was authorized last year by the shareholders.
In terms of exactly what constitute a large loss, I think, we have to wait to see exactly what
losses occurred, in which context they occur. I think it would be fair to say that if we had
another year, remarkable year, in 2016 similar to what we've experienced both in 2015 as
well as 2014 with a very low level of actual nat cat losses, that would be most likely the
type of situation that could contribute to us coming to the conclusion that once again we
find ourselves in an excess capital situation.
In terms of your questions around SST and S&P and excess capital levels, then I'll just
reiterate the communication we've done earlier that, indeed, a S&P AA plus $3 billion to
$5 billion is roughly in order of magnitude SST of 200%. These are two different systems.
Page 3 of 27



Company N ame: Swiss Re AG
Company Ticker: SREN SW Equity
Date: 2016-02-23

So, they don't necessarily always operate in lockstep. But I think it would be fair to say, in
conjunction with a SST around 205%, that we also again remain comfortably in excess of
the S&P AA plus $3 billion to $5 billion. So, with that, let me turn it over to Matt for the
second question.

A - Matthias Weber

{BIO 21493871 <GO>}

Okay. Good morning and good afternoon also from my side. First, if you think my voice
sounds a little bit deeper than it usually does, I'm not trying to impersonate Barry White. I
am suffering under a cough. And I hope that nevertheless you can understand me quite
well. Sorry for that.
With respect to your question related to U.S. casualty business, we do not disclose return
on equity numbers by line of business. However, comparing this year's renewal with what
we have seen one year ago, I would like to note that, in U.S. casualty, we have seen
related to general liability and umbrella a flat pricing environment. And related to motor
liability, we have seen increases between 5% and 10%. This in reaction to the reserve
strengthening that some players in the industry, including also Swiss Re, have been taking.

Q - Xin Mei Wang

{BIO 20796577 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Thank you. Can we go to the next question?

Operator
Next question comes from Daniel Bischof, Baader-Helvea. Please go ahead.

Q - Daniel Bischof

{BIO 17407166 <GO>}

Good afternoon. Two questions, please. The first one is on the renewals. So, you
reported 16% growth in tailored transactions. Could you provide a bit more details? I
mean what the drivers were behind the growth there? I'd be interested to know what the
client's motivation was. Was it solvency related? Were there other reasons?
And then, secondly, on Corporate Solutions, my understanding is that the 101% combined
ratio forecast is also a high level, given the buildup of the own network. However, even,
let's say, at the lower level of excluding this, the ROE target of 10% to 15%, looks quite
ambitious. So, could you talk about how you see the two targets and why they're
consistent?

A - Matthias Weber

{BIO 21493871 <GO>}

Okay. So, with respect to the renewal, the motivation for the tailored solutions and the
large transactions we have been selling, the main motivations were capital-driven and
volatility concerns that our clients needed to address. The 101% estimated combined ratio
for 2016 is still in line with the return on equity target range of 10% to 15% overall. Please
Page 4 of 27



Company N ame: Swiss Re AG
Company Ticker: SREN SW Equity
Date: 2016-02-23

remember the 10% to 15%, that's a long-term average. We are now more in the softer
piece of the market cycle, which means, with a 101% combined ratio, I would expect
Corporate Solutions to end up more towards the lower end of this range, but still in the
range.

Q - Daniel Bischof

{BIO 17407166 <GO>}

All right. Thanks a lot.

Operator
Next question comes from Kamran Hossain, RBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Hi. I've got two questions. The first one is just on Admin Re. I know there's some
comments earlier that you were suggesting that there might be more transactions to
come for Admin Re in the UK. Can I just ask, following the acquisition of Guardian, how
much more headroom do you have to take on credit risk, because I'd think that for kind of
that type of transaction you'd need to take on more credit risk?

Bloomberg Transcript

And the second question for Matt or Barry. Can you just talk us through how you get from
the 97% underlying combined ratio that you set out at the beginning of 2015 to where it
ended up at the end of this year and kind of what the differences were and then how we
should think about adjusting that for 2016, so we get back to the 97%, plus the change?
Thanks very much.

A - Michel M. Liès
Okay. Michel here. I start with the Admin Re question, which is a question to the point. It's
absolutely fair that the proportion of annuities within the Guardian deal did not bring it
over the limits, but that's definitely bringing us in matters of capacity to a certain amount
of credit risk. And among the opportunities that we do see in the UK market, it's probably
fair to summarize that if we could be effective on the unit-linked opportunity more than
annuity one and they are unit-linked opportunities, it would definitely please us quite a lot.
We are not full for the annuity, but we would like probably to balance a little bit with unitlinked at this stage.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Thanks.

A - Matthias Weber

{BIO 21493871 <GO>}

Okay. The first comment being invited to explain the difference between 99.8% and 97%,
of course, feels like a negative thing to do because, at the end, we ended up a little bit
higher on an adjusted basis compared to what we expected at the beginning of the year.
However, therefore, please let me start with the following statement. The 86% combined
ratio is still a fundamentally very good combined ratio. This is true in the context with

Page 5 of 27



Company N ame: Swiss Re AG
Company Ticker: SREN SW Equity
Date: 2016-02-23

FINAL

others, but it's also true in the context of the market and what was possible by the
market.
And, of course, if we adjust for prior year development and good luck on the nat cat side,
we end up at 99.8%. However, please keep in mind that prior year development is not just
a one-off to put aside. It's still underwriting profit. It's just underwriting profit from a
different underwriting year, but still extremely valuable. So, how to get from the 99.8% to
the 97%, which was the expectations we formulated one year ago approximately? We
have three main reasons that explain the majority of this difference. All are about equal in
size.
The first is, during the year on the Reinsurance side, we experienced an above-average
amount of manmade large losses in the current accident year. This amounts to
approximately 0.8% points. Secondly, as a result of the extremely high degree of good
luck on the nat cat side, we are missing quite a good amount of reinstatement premium.
And in addition to that, especially in Q4, we had to pay higher profit commissions as a
result of this low nat cat activity.

Bloomberg Transcript

This is a second order impact which applied to us already in the past. But this year is the
first year where we experienced such a big discrepancy between our actual nat cat loss
burden of below US$200 million and what we expected, which is equal to US$1.5 billion.
So, as a result of this gap which is bigger than $1.3 billion, something like 0.7% combined
ratio points in reinstatement premiums are missing.
And thirdly, I hinted already, this year, we made some adjustments to our reserves for U.S.
motor from prior accident years. And these adjustments were more than offset by
favorable development from other lines of business. However, when we made this
adjustment, we also looked at the current accident year loss ratio and decided to increase
the current accident year loss ratio in Q3 and in Q4.
This is not prior year development. But you could describe it as current year adverse
development in response to what we have seen in the market. And this impacts the
current accident year loss ratio and with this also the combined ratio by 0.6%. So, it's
current accident year development, most of it driven by business that was written in
underwriting year 2014.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

That clears it up. Can I just follow-up? Matt, are you not – if you're backing out your
reserve releases on one side, do you think it's fair to, I guess, take the hit on the current
year adverse developments as well or are you kind of being overly harsh on yourself ?

A - Matthias Weber

{BIO 21493871 <GO>}

Yes, because prior year reserve development complements current year reserve
development. That's the reason why I tried a little bit carefully to explain this difference.
So, typically, when we speak of reserve development or prior year development, what we
mean is prior accident year development. And here, we are dealing with current accident
Page 6 of 27

FINAL

year development. That does not overlap with prior accident year development. It adds
up.
Normally, it does not happen because when we do the pricing analysis, when we do the
costing analysis, we feel good about it for at least a year, especially on the casualty side.
However, given the recent development, given the recent loss ratio deterioration, we
decided to increase our cost and our price loss ratios as quickly as in the current accident
year.

Next question comes from Olivia Brindle, Bank of America. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Olivia Brindle

{BIO 17273762 <GO>}

Hi there. Good afternoon. So, on my first question, I guess, just picking up where you left
off now on the combined ratio guidance. How do we get to the 99% for P&C Re from
where you are now, which, based on, Matt, what you just said, I guess, underlying is really
more like 98.3%, if we back out what you might call one-off in the year? So, you're not
really pricing in much of the deterioration on P&C Re. And then similarly, on cost, though, if
we take 103.6%, some of that was higher manmade claims. So, you're probably already at
about 101% or even slightly higher. So, again, how do we reconcile that 2016 guidance with
where you are already to the one on adjusted-adjusted basis for 2015?
And then the second question just around the capital. You've disclosed some useful detail
on the sensitivities and how that's affected by Guardian, in particular, on the credit risk
side. Just wondering if that has any effect at all on how much capital you think you need in
terms of the buffer or anything like that. Obviously, your volatility should be slightly higher
now. So, wondering if that affects your thinking at all. Thank you.

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Thanks, Olivia. So, why don't you let me take the second question first and give Matt a
chance to take his breath a little bit? And then we'll wrap back around on the combined
ratio guidance 2016. So, in short and it's going to be too short of an answer. Then I'll
expand upon it a little bit. Now we've maintained a very strong capital position. We say as
a target across the group, 185%, exactly for the purpose of being able to absorb hits to
our capital that may come from a number of different sources, including but certainly not
limited to volatility on the financial markets. We're operating under the Swiss Solvency
Test regime under a system that actually is economical on both sides of our balance
sheet.

FINAL

Now, whenever we acquired Guardian, of course, we were quite cognizant of the fact it
would be bringing on additional assets and certainly also additional credit risk. Now what
we have now, let's say, seen, having concluded the transaction, is fully in line with our
expectations, in fact, if anything, perhaps slightly better than our expectations in one or
two specific areas. I'll come back to that, to be frank, at the time of our Q1
announcements because it's a 2016 event.
The figures that we've indicated in the presentation, we thought it was fair to go ahead
and show the incremental impact, particularly on the credit side, coming from the
acquisition of Guardian based on the volatility that we've all seen over the course of the
last seven week or eight week since the year began. I think what I would like to say is that
the type of impacts that we're seeing are right in line with the sensitivities that we've
indicated to you, also I think so far still very much within a one standard deviation type of
move, which in a portfolio of our nature and the portfolio that we hold, I think, is not
surprising.

Bloomberg Transcript

Perhaps the speed with which some of the market movements have come through over
the course of the last several weeks has been a little bit surprising. But the absolute
magnitude has not been. We continue to be well-capitalized. I think that also is reflected in
the board's upcoming proposal for both a regular dividend as well as a continuation, if you
will, of the possibility, should capital developments warrant during the course of 2016 the
possibility to once again initiate a share buyback programme.
So, in summary, let me just say that you're absolutely right. The additional credit coming
from the Guardian acquisition does increase our economic exposure to credit spreads
widening. But the magnitude is absolutely within the ranges that we anticipated at the
time that we announced the acquisition. And we remain comfortably capitalized. Let me
turn it over to Matt.

A - Matthias Weber

{BIO 21493871 <GO>}

Okay. So, thanks for your question, Olivia. The first comment I would like to make, we do
not call it guidance. We call it – it's our own estimate of what our combined ratio could be.
And we are actually choosing the word estimate also in order to reflect the fact that there
is some degree of uncertainty associated with it. If you look back, there have been years
where we came in lower and there have been years where we came in a little bit higher. In
the long-term, this averages itself out, but it's definitely not a precise forecast. And,
therefore, we prefer the term estimate over guidance.
How do we get from the 97% to the 99%? 97% was the estimate we issued last year.
Please remember the three reasons which I used to explain how we got from the 99.8%
to the 97%. The first is an above average amount of large losses. We believe that's a oneoff. In some years, you're above average. In other years, you're below average. So, we
correct for that and take that out.
Secondly, the missing reinstatement premium as a result of an extremely low amount of
nat cat loss activity, it takes that out as well because our estimate is based on an assumed
mean nat cat loss burden. And in a year with a mean nat cat loss burden, there are no
Page 8 of 27



Company N ame: Swiss Re AG
Company Ticker: SREN SW Equity
Date: 2016-02-23

FINAL

reinstatement premium missing. The third impact, the U.S. motor accident year addition to
the reserve, that we take into account. So, let me explain how we make the walk from the
97% to the 99%.
We start at the 97%. First, we add 0.6% for the U.S. reserve. Secondly, we add another
point for a change in business mix. If you look at this past renewal, you might observe that
we shifted a little bit away from property to casualty. And casualty typically comes with a
higher combined ratio. So, in total, that shift alone adds another 1% point to the estimated
combined ratio.
Then continued pricing deterioration and higher interest rates, if it happens, we assume
on a combined basis this adds another 1.5 points. And then the fourth correction we made
is, with respect to expenses, we reduced our estimated expense ratio by 1.1% in order to
reflect the fact that we expect our volume to slightly increase as a result of increased
activity on the large transaction side and on the tailored solutions side.
And in addition to that, as a result of the strengthening U.S. dollar, the ratio between
costs, which incur mostly in Europe, including Switzerland, and business, which incurs more
in the U.S., actually is expected to decrease. And putting these four elements together
explains the walk between the 97%, which was last year's estimate and the 99%, which is
the combined ratio estimate for 2016.

Thank you very much, Matt. May we go to the next question?

Operator
Next question comes from Thomas Seidl, Bernstein. Please go ahead.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you. Good afternoon. Two questions. First is on the investment income side
after, to me, a relatively stable year, we noticed a quite strong and sharp drop in regular
investment income, partly offset by relatively high levels in net gains and losses. So, my
first question is, what is the outlook for 2016, 2017, if it's fair to assume 20%, 30% drop
year-on-year and what is the outlook on realized gains for those next two years?
Question number two is, again, on the life run-off business. I think I remember you have
appetite for at least one more larger transaction. So, I wonder if you can give us the
update on the current market, run-off market, maybe not only the UK, but also in the rest
of Europe and whether you would see an increased likelihood of you doing a transaction
versus when we spoke last time.

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Okay, Thomas, thanks. Let's turn it to Guido for the first question and then perhaps Michel
will take the second.

A - Guido Fürer

FINAL

Okay. Thank you much. Coming back to your first question, if you look at the investment
result in 2015, I think, it's – in respect of return on investments, it's a change of 0.2%
compared to 2014. Again, most of that is related to have a different net investment
income contribution from, let's say, equity accounted holdings, which we have.
On the gain realization – and probably you have seen it's exactly the same amount in 2014
compared to 2015. That means the change is coming from the – basically from the net
investment income. And, again, if you look at the various contributions, I think, the drop
which you see is on the equity accounted side. Again, that shows equity is a volatile asset
class. Swiss Re has, I think, a relatively modest exposure to the equity market. Of course,
you cannot expect that each quarter looks the same as the prior one.

Bloomberg Transcript

We look to have a long-term asset allocation. And that's why also we try to smooth the
result towards the underlying portfolio composition. I think the biggest change, as you
have already commented before, was that we added more credit. But, overall, the equity
exposure is pretty much the same. That's why to give guidance is a challenge, particular if
it's the current financial market. You have seen and also David commented before, we
had a very volatile start of the year. I do not expect that volatility will disappear based on
the underlying factor.
Now, important is that you see the main driver of investment contribution. One is net
investment income. Again, there, you should mainly look at the running yield, which is a
good indicator. Basically, the gain realization, that's subject to, I think, what the market
offers. Overall, we try to position the portfolio for a volatile environment. And that's why
also you see an asset allocation which is basically in line with our outlook.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Maybe I wasn't clear. So, I was expecting you actually to talk about the running yield has
dropped. It was stable in the past three years. And now it dropped 30 bps year-on-year.
So, my question is, given current reinvestment rate, is this now continuing at this speed?

A - Guido Fürer
I think the drop in running yield, to a certain extent, yes, it's related to that we see still very
low rates and actually, year to date, they are lower than the beginning of the year. You
know all the reasons. I think I don't need to comment on. But the major driver of the drop
of 0.3% last year actually was that we took some of the cash and put it into the short-term
part of the government bond. And in the running yield, we exclude cash. That means we
mainly looked at the fixed income beyond the year, which is the best guidance, in my view.
Of course, if you take – you see it was $6.2 billion of cash we put into the investment
portfolio, approximately $1.5 billion additional credit, and then also we had a real estate
investment of $0.7 billion, which should contribute to future net investment income. And
the rest was basically just the shift from cash into the short-term government. And, again,
if you invest into short government, just take 1.5-year Treasury bill, you'll vary of 0.6%. Of
course, this reduces the respective running yield for the year, particularly if you compare
Page 10 of 27



Company N ame: Swiss Re AG
Company Ticker: SREN SW Equity
Date: 2016-02-23

to the former year. But, again, probably more than half of that drop of 0.3% was related
to the reallocation of cash into the short-term pocket of government bonds.

FINAL

Thanks, Guido.

A - Michel M. Liès
Okay. On the life run-off market, I think, the work which has been done by Admin Re in the
UK to be seen as one of the main consolidator is bringing its fruit in matters of pipeline. I
don't want to go into the details of the pipeline, but they are definitely in the UK, several
opportunities, among which some of them are not exposing us to annuities, as I said it
before. I also did mention that we may see and start to consider opportunities outside of
the UK. But there we need to be very prudent.

Bloomberg Transcript

First, the fact that the company wants to sell a life run-off doesn't mean systematically
that this life run-off is corresponding to our appetite. We don't have solution to problems
which do not have solution. I'm not saying that all the life run-off deals in Continental
Europe are that complicated. But they are definitively sometimes mismatched between
the liability which are engaged and the asset portfolio on which we don't have too much
solutions.
There is also, if you speak about the extension outside of the UK, the fact that it won't be
normally done on a UK platform, meaning that the quality of the platform in any kind of
first deal on Continental Europe will be also a very important element to judge for the
conclusion of the deal. But, again, top, I think, in the UK, because of the deals which have
been achieved in the last one year or two years to really attract the majority of the
pipeline, it's very prudent on the continent about the opportunities, taking especially into
account that we need also a platform and not only a portfolio.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

As a result, are you more confident now that we'll see a transaction in 2016?

A - Michel M. Liès
Sorry. I didn't get that one.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

As a result of these considerations, are you more confident of seeing another Admin Re
transaction in 2016?

A - Michel M. Liès
I cannot commit totally to that. But there is definitively a certain chance of seeing that
happening, definitively, knowing nevertheless also that some of the activities of our Admin
Re team is in the integration of Guardian. They've concluded the HSBC integration
successfully. But there is a lot of work to do in the integration of Guardian. It's not an easy

Bloomberg Transcript

Hello. Two questions from me. Firstly, on the tax gain that you had this quarter. I
understand it's to do with restructuring some of your subsidiaries. But when I look back at
the last three years, there seems to be, I think, only three quarters where the tax rate is
around the 23% to 25% that you normally guide to. So, I was wondering if there's anything
that you can see in 2016 and 2017 that might cause you to have further tax benefits.
And the second question is around the Corporate Solutions. I think there was a question
earlier about it. But I'm not sure if you got round to answering it. But when I look at the
2015 adjusted combined ratio, even if you factor in the higher manmade losses, I think, I
get to the 102% for 2015. So, how are you so confident of kind of improving that to 101%?
Is there still some growth that you're still factoring in the business or is that some expense
– is there some expenses (36:48), for example? Thank you.

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Well, let me pick up the first question. And then I'll turn it over to Matt for the second. So,
on the tax side, indeed, you saw in Q4 that we had a number of tax benefits that come
through, some of which were related to restructuring of various legal entities. But I'd also
like to just point out that we had audits that successfully were finalized in a number of
different countries. And, collectively, that contributed, of course, to the tax benefit that
came through in Q4.
You're right that, over the last couple of years, if you look at our effective tax rate, it's
been below the statutory rate. There are a number of different factors that contributed to
that. Of course, part of it is just the timing difference. If you look at our balance sheet, you
can also see a fairly significant DTA sitting on the balance sheet. We continue to progress
various discussions with tax authorities around the globe. We continue to be a very healthy
taxpayer. Actually, our cash taxes paid in 2015 were up quite a bit from the level in
previous years.

In terms of forward-looking comment, I think, the most appropriate thing to do – and it's
what we also do internally – is we use the effective tax rate, which in our case is actually
now just a little bit higher than the Swiss rate. So, something in the range of 23%, 24% is
probably not a bad starting spot. Let me turn it over to Matt.

FINAL

A - Matthias Weber

{BIO 21493871 <GO>}

Okay. Corporate Solutions, a walk between the normalized combined ratio 2015 and the
estimate for 2016, starting point is 103.6%. This starting point includes an above average
amount of large and medium-sized losses amounting to 2.7% points. If we take that out
and add another 1% point for price softening and subtract a little bit for portfolio
composition shifts, we expect to shift a little bit more away from long-tail business
towards short-tail business. We end up at 101%.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Hi. Good afternoon. So I'll not ask about the underlying for now, but I do want to
understand this portfolio shift that we talk about. For example, slide 37 today of the
renewals, obviously, shows a mix towards casualty. But then this same slide last year, the
numbers are not that different. In fact, on casualty, in fact, if anything, the difference is
more in the shorter-tail specialty lines probably. So I'm just trying to compare or just
understand this business mix shift from a combined ratio perspective.
And that's one more question if I can put in please. On the nat cat slide in the P&C Re, the
ratio of the nat cat expected loss in a given year versus nat cat premiums seems to be
going up in 2016. I can understand why nat cat premiums are going down. But shouldn't
one have expected lower nat cat losses as well in the budget for 2016? So that's the two
questions, please, business mix and nat cat loading. Thank you.

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Thanks.

A - Matthias Weber

{BIO 21493871 <GO>}

So, with respect to the portfolio shift, what you see on page 37 is, to a large degree,
influenced by large transactions. Sometimes, these large transactions include more
casualty. And then that shifts portfolio weight away from property and specialty more
towards casualty. And sometimes, the opposite is happening. What we experienced at
the past renewal was exactly this. We wrote a few but large transactions, including a big
amount of casualty business.

FINAL

And that's the reason why we are seeing an increase of the casualty proportion from 43%
to 46%. We did the math and tried to calculate what is the impact on our normalized
combined ratio for the purpose of coming up with our estimate and concluded that the
impact is of the order of 1%. With respect to your second question, could you please point
me to the page you were referring to?

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Well, these numbers I got more when I asked the Investor Relations team. The nat cat
expected loss is $1.5 billion, both years 2015 and 2016.

A - Matthias Weber

{BIO 21493871 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

And the nat cat premiums are going down, $2.6 billion to $2.2350 billion. So, I can
understand the second trend. But then I could have expected that if you're reducing your
risk for nat cat, you probably would expect a lower nat cat budget as well. And that,
obviously, is important also from this whole underlying debate. But this is just one angle I
wanted to check before we move on.

A - Matthias Weber

{BIO 21493871 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Okay. So, the reason why the premium is lower is pretty obvious.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Matthias Weber

{BIO 21493871 <GO>}

That's the price softening we have been seeing already, which will impact also the
accident year 2016. Why is the nat cat loss the same? The reason is the following. What
you see here is the net after reinsurance and retrocession. So, it's the net after hedging.
And when we determine how much of the gross business we write, we want to keep net
on our book. We take into account the capitalization we have in our group in order to
determine what our appetite is to keep exposure.
We decided in 2016, given that we are still above all our technical thresholds from a
capital perspective that we would like to write against our full risk appetite. And this
means we decided to retain the same amount of nat cat exposure on our book net after
retrocession as we did in 2015. That's the reason for this underlying stability of the $1.5
billion expected nat cat loss.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Thanks, Matt.

Next question comes from Andrew Ritchie, Autonomous. Please go ahead.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi there. First question just back to the issue of credit risk or asset risk, I thought I'd
understood at the time of the Guardian deal that you anticipated probably taking down a
bit of the pro forma credit risk exposure of the combined group. I guess, I think, from
what you're saying, that's not the plan now. You're very happy with the pro forma credit
exposure, even in light of slightly more volatile markets. Can you just confirm that? And is
there any situation where, because this is at a prolonged integration phase, I mean you
don't do the Part VII transfer, I think, until 2017. Does that restrict your ability to do things
you want to do with the Guardian assets?
The second question, a simple one really. You grew the dividend 8% or 8.2%. I guess I'm
just trying to understand why 8.2%? I mean, in simple terms, you've talked about a
dividend policy where, I think, you've said you want to grow it in line with your long-term
earnings growth and at a minimum keep it flat. So, is 8.2% what you feel the underlying
earnings growth is? Should I adjust it for the lower share count, so it's actually really 11% or
12% or something? What is the philosophy behind the 8%? Thanks.

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

All right. Thanks, Andrew. Let's let Guido address the first. And I'll come back to the
dividend.

A - Guido Fürer
Thank you. Thank you for the question, Andrew. I think, on the credit side, you're
absolutely right. There was – through Guardian, we inherited about 6% in respect of our
asset allocation with regard to credit risk. Now, again, this is credit risk which we like. Of
course, it was part of the costing and pricing of the transaction. As you can see in the
slides, I think, the credit quality is still very high. And there's no compromising has
occurred, nor will occur over the next few times.
Overall, we have 44% in credit, which I believe is a reasonable allocation. Particularly, if you
look now at credit, again, U.S. investment grade trading above 200 basis points above
government bond. That means there's a lot of bad news priced in. Again, we have the
capital to ride through some of the volatility. We're a long-term investor. Our main, of
course, focus is on any credit migration or default. And in that context, we're very
comfortable with what we currently have on our book.
Page 15 of 27



Company N ame: Swiss Re AG
Company Ticker: SREN SW Equity
Date: 2016-02-23

FINAL

Although it's a high allocation, but, again, if you look at such type of transaction as
Guardian, this is pretty much you acquire a closed book of business and you basically look
which assets are the best fit for that type of business. It's not a total return view. It's the
opposite. It's basically supporting a long-term positioning, both on the liability as well as
on the asset side. That's why very comfortable what we acquired. 44% seems a
reasonable allocation compared to, I guess, the outlook which we have.
Now, can we move the asset risk before Part VII? Yes. Swiss Re is at risk in this portfolio
since 6 of January, since closing. And, of course, we look at each and every part of the
portfolio. If we don't feel comfortable with any part, any specific name, of course, we'll
move. That means we have the full flexibility which you would expect as an owner of such
a portfolio.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

And, sorry, is 44% the limit you'd want to go to or is there room to go higher or you're
kind of at limit? I'm not sure what you mean by when you say reasonable allocation
because, obviously, it's higher than the last five years – where you've been the last five
years.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Guido Fürer
Absolutely. In the meantime, I guess, also, the riskiness of certain government bond has
shifted over the last few years. At the end, you are a big fixed income investor as an
insurance company, particularly if you're active in life books or the closed book. That
means you need to think which are the most attractive part within fixed income. And I think
government bond probably need to be assessed nowadays differently than I guess five
years ago. I consider a high quality credit portfolio absolutely fit for purpose.
Now, 44% is the current snapshot. Some of the percentage is driven by markets. Of
course, if equity is going up and credit stays, you see different allocation. We work with
ranges. But I believe the current allocation is, again, reasonable in the context of being a
long-term investor, having an ALM principle at the outset and in also respect of the
investment outlook which we have.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay.

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Thanks, Guido. Let me come back then, Andrew, to your question regarding the dividend.
So, first, let me just reiterate indeed what you said regarding our capital management
philosophies. And at the risk of repetition, it really is about maintaining as the first priority
a very strong capital position, which, I think, we, again, confirm today at an estimated SST
of around 205%. We continue to maintain a very strong capital position. The actual
hierarchy is maintain the regular dividend. Where we can invest and invest wisely, of
course, to grow profits in the future, that allows us to increase the regular dividend.

Page 16 of 27



Company N ame: Swiss Re AG
Company Ticker: SREN SW Equity

FINAL

These things are obviously quite closely together. And then, of course, when we come to
the conclusion for various reasons, we may be sitting on excess capital, i.e., capital we
don't reasonably expect to be able to deploy within our businesses according to the
strategy we've articulated at the financial hurdles that we've indicated. Then we look for
ways to return it. So, that's just a generic statement of our capital management
philosophies and approach. And I hope you've seen us actually operate on that basis over
the course of the last several years.
As for the dividend now, the board will propose to the shareholders in April an 8.2%
increase to the CHF 4.6 that Michel referred to. There are a number of different factors
we look at when coming to this recommendation that the management made to the
board. We look at the sustainability of the payout, i.e., maintain the regular dividend where
we can. We look at how successful we've been in actually investing in the business over
the recent period of time.

Bloomberg Transcript

And just think about some of the activities that we've demonstrated to you on both sides
of our balance sheet, where we've properly positioned our assets and, I think, continue to
invest and I would say wisely and attractively in a number of different segments. The Life
& Health continue to show good progress, Admin Re good progress, Corporate Solutions
good progress. So, that gives us the confidence to look at an increase in the dividend
now.
8.2%, you could say couldn't you have made it 8% or 9%, round number? We ended up at
the CHF 4.6. It's not an exact science. But I think it's a good indication of the management
as well as the board's confidence in not only the capital position of the firm, but also the
continued earnings potential of the firm.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

When you think about the dividend, do you think about a dollar million amount or the per
share amount in terms of when you talk about growth and/or maintaining flat on a
previous year?

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

I don't know how we would separate the two. So, we look at a number of different
perspectives simultaneously, Andrew. I can't say that one is more relevant than the other. I
don't know. I don't think we somehow carve one perception of reality out and forget
about it for a while. So, we look at a number of different perceptions. But, most
importantly, we look at the underlying earnings potential of the firm, the sustainability of
the dividend. And we look also at what we see in terms of future capital generation,
opportunities to invest. And we want to both continue to invest wisely in the business and
continue to operate with good capital discipline.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

Q - Vikram Gandhi

{BIO 6133175 <GO>}

Hi. I've got two questions. The first is can you give us some color on the potential impact
that Brexit, if it happens, would have on the group? And, secondly, how do you see the
soft pricing in the U.S. commercial insurance impacting your portfolio over the course of
the year? Thank you.

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Matt, you want to take the second while I get myself ready for the Brexit question?

A - Matthias Weber

{BIO 21493871 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. So, the softening pricing environment in U.S. commercial insurance, we, of course,
are observing this directly with the Corporate Solution business we are writing and
indirectly also on the Reinsurance side. We are taking it into account in the assessment
before we actually accept such a business. But you're right. It is softening in large parts.
And we're observing it. And we are taking it into account.

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Okay. And let me come back to Brexit. And let me just preface my answer by saying, of
course, Europe has been in a very exciting place for financial markets, not only in the
recent period with discussions around Brexit, but going back now already several years,
discussions around the periphery, discussions around the immigration, and a number of
items impacting the overall, I would say, cohesion and the confidence in various aspects of
Europe.
Let me come back to Brexit. So, it's obviously too early for us to make any sort of
prediction, nor are we in the prediction business about what the British voters may
ultimately decide in their upcoming referendum in June. And, ultimately, of course, the
impact and the materiality of the impact will depend a lot on developments between now
and the ultimate decision in June. You could imagine, however, as a large long-term
investor that, obviously, the potential impact in terms of increased volatility on financial
markets, changes in FX rates, all be quite important for us to follow.
Obviously, we don't know exactly how a potential Brexit would be implemented and the
basis upon which those discussions, the actual mechanics of an exit would take place. You
could imagine different scenarios. If we look at a worst-case type of scenario, you could
imagine a breakdown in the ability to come to timely and appropriate agreements
regarding matters like movement of capital or even movement of people and services.

So, we could have a very significant negative impact coming at us from a regulatory
compliance point of view, but also just from an outright operations point of view.
Now, as I mentioned, I'm referring to a worst-case type of scenario. I don't think it would
be appropriate for us to immediately assume that would be the case. Obviously, there's
still quite a lot of debate to take place between now and June. I think I will summarize,
however, in my answer by just letting you know that, as with a number of potential risk –
emerging risk themes, our responsibility is to make sure we watch them carefully, where
appropriate, take measures to position ourselves to be able to respond as needed and,
of course, remain very diligent to the ongoing developments. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Hello. Thanks very much. I'm sorry to put Matt's voice under pressure. First of all, could you
give us a bit more clarity on the U.S. motor charge you referred to? It seems to be buried
within the 5.1 points of positive development. So, could you maybe tell us the size of the
charge you took in the U.S. and help us scale it in terms of what base reserves that was
on? And then could you let us know how much you changed the initial loss ratio pick on
this year of origin?
And then, secondly, David, you seemed – when talking about the caveats around the
buyback for the rest of this year, you were – sorry, for the next buyback, you seemed a bit
more cautious than I anticipated when you were talking about large losses. I thought the
answer would simply be, so long as we're within our budget, everything's fine. But you
seem to be allowing for more spaces than that. You said only if it's a good year like 2014
or 2015 was is everything okay. So, can you just clarify that? Should we be more cautious,
even if you're on that $1.5 billion budget?
And then I'm sorry to stretch it to three questions, but very briefly. Matt, when you were
answering Vinit's question about the nat cat budget, if I paraphrase what you said, it
sounded like you were saying, because we've got more capital, we thought we could
retain more risk for nat cat, which to me is not what I'd like to hear. I'd rather hear you say,
whether or not the business is incrementally more or less attractive drives that decision.
So, I might have misunderstood. But could you just sort of repeat your logic for effectively
on a net basis retaining more exposure to nat cat?

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Okay. Will, before I turn over the mic to Matt, welcome back to our Q&A session. So, it's
good to hear your voice in this. I appreciate not only your questions, but also suggesting
the answers to us. So, we're ready to do our best to meet your expectations in terms of
Page 19 of 27



Company N ame: Swiss Re AG

appropriate answers. Let me turn it over to Matt first. Then I'll come back on the question
regarding the buyback.

FINAL

A - Matthias Weber

{BIO 21493871 <GO>}

Okay. So with respect to your first question, I would like to repeat that the current accident
year development is not part of the prior accident year development. The two things
complement each other. The quantum with respect to prior accident year development
on the U.S. motor side amounts to US$90 million negative. So, that was an adverse
development, part of the much bigger overall favorable development. The quantum with
respect to the accident year 2015 current year adverse development impacted the overall
combined ratio and the overall loss ratio by 0.6% points.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

So let me just ask then. What was the base of reserves before the $90 million
strengthening? And what actually was the loss pick move from two for U.S. motor?

A - Michel M. Liès
Just a second.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Matthias Weber

{BIO 21493871 <GO>}

Let me in the meantime respond to your third question. The US$1.5 billion, on the nat cat
side, this business, while it is not as attractive anymore as it used to be, this business still
generates favorable margin for us and our shareholders. It's just this positive margin is not
as big anymore as it used to be. And, therefore, it does make sense from our perspective
to deploy the capital which we have and which we decided to have on our balance sheet
after paying for the dividend and after using capital for other opportunities such as
opportunities on the Admin Re side than not writing this business and not incurring the
positive margin at all.

A - Michel M. Liès
Will, regarding your question on the motor business reserves, let us come back to you
separately, also look at some of our reserves developments and come back to you, if you
don't mind.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Thank you.

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Okay. Well, thanks. So I'll go into the buyback. Listen, we – of course, we announced and
received shareholder approval in April 2015 for the current share buyback programme,
which is progressing well and we anticipate to successfully conclude it by the beginning of
March. I think we learned a little bit from our communication around that. And what we
want to do now is make sure that there's absolutely no misunderstanding. The proposal
that the board will make regarding the dividend reflects our capital position as of the end
Page 20 of 27



Company N ame: Swiss Re AG
Company Ticker: SREN SW Equity
Date: 2016-02-23

FINAL

of 2015. And, also, I think, as going back to my earlier response to Andrew, it suggests a
confidence in the ongoing earnings capacity of the firm and sustainable payout level
leading to an increase in regular dividend of 8.2%.
The share buyback is – under Swiss rules, we need to get approval for an authorization for
it upfront. But the actual decision to launch that buyback is going to be depending on the
way that the market and our results and our capital position develops during the course of
2016. There are a number of things that can influence that, one being losses, large or
otherwise, another being opportunities that we see throughout the course of the year to
actually deploy the capital that we have available to us.

Bloomberg Transcript

I think it's a little bit challenging to say under exactly what situation, exactly what
timeframe we may or may not launch the programme. I think the key message is that it's a
tool available to the company, subject to approval of the shareholders in April. Obviously,
the decision to launch it is subject to the same regulatory approvals that we had related
to the current programme that allows us in the event that our capital situation develops
such that we do find ourselves with excess capital that we can accelerate a return of
some of that capital through the buyback.
I don't think it's really appropriate now to start drawing out all sorts of scenarios under
which situation we would or wouldn't. I do think it's appropriate to just remind everyone
that, similar to in 2015, it's likely that we'll want to see a good part of the year develop,
see how the results have developed, not specifically tied to North American wind, but
certainly North America wind is important risk event for us. So, I think, we'll just try to make
sure that people understand that the buyback programme is a tool available to us to allow
us to accelerate return on capital as and when the capital developments during the
course of the year would allow it to take place.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Hi. Thank you. Good afternoon. Two questions from my side, please. Firstly, I'm trying to
get an understanding of your kind of sustainable level of profitability. 2015 was obviously a
very good year, $4.6 billion of net income. But there was a very low level of natural
catastrophes. There was a high level of gains in the year. And the tax level was also quite
low. If I try and normalize that starting level, I would normalize the 86% combined ratio at
about 99%. I would think that the level of gains that you realized in 2015 looks high. So,

Page 21 of 27



Company N ame: Swiss Re AG
Company Ticker: SREN SW Equity
Date: 2016-02-23

FINAL

instead of $1.4 billion, I might be thinking about $1 billion as a normal level. And then you've
already said that the tax rate should be about 23%, 24%.
That gives me about $2.2 billion or so of net income as a kind of starting point. And when I
look at the dividend on the ordinary dividend in relation to that after you've increased it by
8% today, it's a 70% payout ratio. So, I guess my question is, are there other things I
should be normalizing for as a starting point or kind of how shall I think about the
sustainability of that dividend if that payout ratio does look quite high? That's my first
question.
Secondly, congratulations on the inching forward of disclosure in the Life & Health Re
business, which is welcome, at the back of the presentation. I suppose I'd like to kind of
understand what your direction is with this because, last year, we were led to believe that
you would significantly improve the disclosure. And we didn't really get much at the – well,
nothing at all really at the Investor Day. And this is the first kind of step forward. It's now
about half of your allocated capital in the business. And from an outsider's perspective,
it's very difficult to understand what the risks are. So, I guess, I'd like some kind of firm
commitment and understanding about where you're going with that disclosure, please.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

All right. Thanks, James. I'll take a stab at both and see whether or not anyone would like
to join me. First, on the sustainability, listen, I appreciate the work you go through in
coming to what you think to be an appropriate normalization. I don't intend to respond to
any of the individual figures that you've cited. Of course, everyone has their own way of
going about it. When we look at our underlying business, the diversity of our business, I
think, the sustainability of the profit flows that we see, the incremental profit that we think
will emerge from some of the investments that we've made recently, we feel
comfortable that the dividend, as increased to CHF 4.6, is a level that's sustainable.
Of course, any individual year can lead to higher or lower actual losses than what we
would have estimated on an average basis. In fact, in most years, we probably have a little
bit of a better performance than what the average would be as we have some peak loss
years vetted in that average as well. But I think the increase to CHF 4.6 is a reflection of
the management's belief and the strong and sustainable profits that will come from the
various business segments that we have. And we also continue to see good opportunities
to continue to invest in profitable growth. So, we feel quite comfortable with that.
As to your second, I appreciate you've noticed that we've included a little incremental. I
appreciate there's a different anticipation or hope that you've expressed in the past. We
will continue, I think, to reflect upon the disclosure that we give regarding each of the
business activities, not just on the Life & Health side. We appreciate that it's an important
component of our overall business mix and overall balance sheet and important allocation
of capital. We announced, of course, toward the end of 2015 around our Investor Day the
formation of this Life Capital business unit, which is clearly more than just Admin Re,
although Admin Re forms an important component.

I think it would be fair to expect us during the course of 2016 to, over the course of the
year, come back with more information about both the Life Capital business, its
aspirations, if you will, our expectations for that business, as well as some incremental
information regarding our expectation regarding the profit emergence, cash flow profiles
of the Life & Health Re business. So, we're thinking about it. We're looking at it. And we'll
come back to you.

Next question comes from Frank Kopfinger, Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.

Q - Frank Kopfinger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

Good afternoon, everybody. I have two questions. My first question is on the Corporate
Solutions estimate for the combined ratio of 101%. Does this higher figure, the 101%, have
any impact on your 2020 targets and the volume growth that you are targeting for? And
the second question is, again, on the tax effect. I think part of the explanation was also a
foreign currency translation effect. Can you share there some sort of sensitivities whether
a stronger U.S. dollar has a positive impact on your tax effect overall and then how we
should think about it going forward?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Okay. I'll pick up the second question and let Matt respond to the first.

A - Matthias Weber

{BIO 21493871 <GO>}

Okay. So the 101% estimated combined ratio, which in the short-term does not impact our
mid-term to long-term targets on the Corporate Solutions side.

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

And short answer on the second is yes. There has been a positive benefit from a rising
dollar related to translation differences between our stat accounts and our GAAP
accounts. We obviously – we reflect that typically once a year in the fourth quarter. It's hard
to predict, of course, what that will bring going forward. But it has been a factor in both
2014 as well as 2015.

Q - Frank Kopfinger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

But can you break down this – split down this effect on the U.S. dollar?

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

No. I won't break it down.

The next question comes from Stefan Schürmann, Bank Vontobel. Please go ahead.

Q - Stef an Schürmann
Yes. Hi. Just two questions, the first one on the renewals again. Can you just update us on
your share of non-proportional business now and proportional? I think, obviously,
proportional increased, non-proportional decreased. And second question, on SST, the
decrease here, can you maybe give us some hint how much the impact was from financial
market and how much from regulatory adjustments?

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Matt, you want to take the first?

A - Matthias Weber

{BIO 21493871 <GO>}

Hold on. I need a second.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Okay. So, while Matt's preparing, let me come back to the question regarding SST. I'm not
in a position to be able to give you a completed answer today, as I will be able to on the
29 of April. As you know, every year, at the beginning of April, we formally file our SST with
FINMA. Actually, what we will do this year is in addition to updating you regarding the
actual SST position, as you know, we estimate it currently to be around 205%, is we're
going to provide to the market a walk, SST to Solvency II walk, for the Swiss Re group as a
whole. So, I'll come back with I hope satisfactory insights to you at the end of April.

Q - Stef an Schürmann
Okay.

A - Matthias Weber

{BIO 21493871 <GO>}

With respect to your question related to the split between proportional and nonproportional, in 2014, we had 58% proportional and the rest was non-proportional and fac.
In 2015 factual, we had 62% proportional and the rest non-proportional and fac. And if we
look at the January 1 renewals, which just did happened, we further increased the ratio
between proportional and non-proportional, driven by a small number of large
transactions, which happened to be proportional ones.

Q - Stef an Schürmann
Okay. Thank you.

Next question comes from Thomas Fossard, HSBC. Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. I've got two questions directed to Matt. The first question would be
on the large transaction, obviously, a large number beyond the proportional side. I think
that, in the past, you indicated especially with Chinese quota share, motor quota share,
that this was huge volumes, but low margin, relatively low margin and predictable margins.
Could you talk about the net share of the large transaction on the proportional side
you've written so far this year?
And the second question will be on your 1% or 2% risk adequacy index. What is the
proportion of the book which is currently on the return below 100%, so below risk
adjusted? And how much of this part of your book may have increased compared to last
year? Thank you.

A - Matthias Weber

{BIO 21493871 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. So, large transactions, if they are proportional, they almost always are characterized
by a lower ratio between margin and premium, but not necessarily a lower ratio between
margin and required capital. Usually, quite the opposite is the case there. And the reason
is, as you indicated, is the case for Chinese motor business. In many cases, the
predictability of the outcome on the proportional side is significantly higher than on the
non-proportional side.
With respect to your second question, I have to tell you we do not have exact numbers
here in front of us. If I could take a guess, I would assume clearly less than 50% of the
business we have been writing has a rate adequacy below 100% right now. However, it is
also clearly more than 0%. A rate adequacy below 100% does not mean it does not
generate economic profit. It just means it generates less economic profit than what we
want to achieve on average across the cycle.
And with respect to your question 2B, given that the market has softened relative to last
year or given that it has further softened relative to last year, the proportion of our book
that is below 100% rate adequacy but still generating a positive economic profit is
accordingly higher than what was the case last year.

Yes. Hi. Thanks. Just two things, guys. On these old manmade losses, we are seeing so
many players in the industry, primary, reinsurers, everybody talking about a certain trend
which is not ebbing – every quarter we see this. And I just wanted a generic comment if
possible from Matt that is there something that we think needs to be done here? Is there
a pattern or not a pattern, purely random? Just a comment here would be really
appreciated. Thank you.

A - Matthias Weber

{BIO 21493871 <GO>}

Okay. So, I'm not talking to the manmade losses of other players in the market. I would
like to just comment on the manmade losses in our own book. On average, on the
reinsurance side, for instance, we are or we have been seeing during the last five years as
an example a manmade large loss burden of US$320 million. In the respective current
accident year, in 2015, we have an actual of US$441 million. In the two years before, we
actually ended up below average. So, I do not see a trend here. And I am not worried
about this. But with averages, you cannot always be below average, right. And the
average is not correct. Sometimes, you are above average. And that's the case this year.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes. But isn't there a demand in the market or there are so many primary players who talk
about this as a problem as well? Is there something you're thinking around from an
industry perspective, not just Swiss Re or reinsurance? Is there anything that you can add?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Matthias Weber

{BIO 21493871 <GO>}

Again, on our own book, we are not concerned. With respect to losses incurred by others,
may I suggest you speak to others about that?

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Sure. Thank you.

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Thanks, Vinit. Thanks, Matt. Next question, please?

Next question is a follow-up question from Ms. Olivia Brindle. Please go ahead.

Q - Olivia Brindle

{BIO 17273762 <GO>}

Hi there. Thank you for taking the follow-up. Just one thing that struck me in your renewals
disclosure was the share of business in EMEA has gone up quite a lot from 42% to 50%. I
presume it's large transactions because that's what you've talked quite a lot about. But
we've heard how European business is probably one of the most difficult areas to be in at
the moment. So, I was just wondering if you could comment on why that pressure is so
much better in big transactions that you've decided to do that much more in that space.
That'd be helpful. Thank you.

FINAL

Okay. So, your comments are actually all correct. It is driven by one big transaction, a large
transaction. It's a proportional one. Your observation with respect to European renewals
have been incredibly tough, relates especially to European nat cat business and,
therefore, has nothing to do with the large transaction we wrote in EMEA.

A - Michel M. Liès
Okay.

A - David Cole

{BIO 7251632 <GO>}

Thank you.

A - Michel M. Liès
Thank you. Yes, no, thank you, Matt. Thank you, David. Thank you very much, all of you, for
joining. Now, just before we close the Q&A, I wanted to come back to your question,
William from KBW, on the $90 million reserve strengthening U.S. motor liabilities. It
represents less than 7% of our total U.S. motor reserves. So, I just wanted to give you the
figure before closing on that. Again, if you have any follow-up questions, you know where
to find us, how to reach us, Investor Relations at Swiss Re. Thank you, again, very much, all
of you, for participating today.
