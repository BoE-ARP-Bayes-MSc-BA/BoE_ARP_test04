Presentation
Operator
Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the SCOR Group 2013 annual results
conference call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the
call over to Antonio Moretti, Investor Relations Director. Please go ahead sir.

Antonio Moretti

{BIO 17681290 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining the SCOR Group Q4 2013 results call.
Before starting the presentation please consider our disclaimer on page 2, which
indicates that the presented Q4 2013 financial information is audited. Also note, as
indicated on page 3, that in this presentation two sets of financial data are used. The first
set is presented on an audited published basis and includes Generali US figures from the
acquisition date of October 1, 2013. Obviously prior-year comparatives do not include

Page 1 of 22

Generali US. The second set of data is presented on an unaudited pro-forma basis and
includes Generali US as if the acquisition had taken place on January 1, 2013.

FINAL

With this I would like to give the floor to Mr. Denis Kessler, CEO and Chairman of the
SCOR Group, who is joined on this call by the whole COMEX team.

Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Thank you, Antonio and good morning everyone. With a record net income of EUR549
million and an ROE of 11.5%, may I say that 2013 was a highly satisfactory year for SCOR.
For me and certainly for the whole COMEX this is largely due to the rigorous and
consistent application of the strategy we've been pursuing over the last 10 years.

Bloomberg Transcript

The Group is transparent about its roadmap and you remember that early September we
presented the new three-year plan called Optimal Dynamics after we completed the
previous three-year plan, the Strong Momentum, by the way a successful completion. The
strategy which is based on a very balanced business mix between life reinsurance on one
side and P&C reinsurance on the other side, and also on the fact we are consistently
striving to optimize the use of resources, human resources, financial resources, capital
resources, is followed by all three of the Group's engines.
SCOR Global P&C, with it's high diversification and status as a tier one partner for its
global clients, is well placed today to make the most of current development on the P&C
business reinsurance market. The success of initiatives like the Lloyds Channel 2015
Syndicate, moreover, demonstrates our agility and our ability to find profitable growth
drivers.
SCOR Global Life, strengthened by the acquisition of Generali US, holds particularly strong
positions in a sector characterized by high barriers of entry. Without deviating from our
core business, biometric risks, we are developing a business in longevity reinsurance
today and financial solutions.
In terms of Investments, moreover, we maintain a prudent strategy that offers the
maximum flexibility.
With regard to the reserves, 2013 has confirmed our ability to combine growth,
profitability and solvency. Gross written premiums have risen by 8.3% in P&C reinsurance
and by 14.5% in life reinsurance at constant exchange rates. We have delivered a high
level of profitability, with a return of 1,129 basis points over the risk-free rate, and this
profitability is based on our technical performance in line with the trajectory set out in
Optimal Dynamics and with the active management of our investment portfolio.
At the same time the Group has consolidated its solvency. SCOR solvency ratio calculated
by internal model stands at 221%. This is at the upper part of the range we have set in
Optimal Dynamics. Combined notably a very strong enterprise risk management and our
capital protection strategy, the famous capital shield strategy, illustrated by the issue of a
mortality bond last September and by the renewal of a contingent capital facility under

very advantageous conditions, amongst other things, this has led Standard & Poor's to
raise the outlook on an A-plus rating to positive.
Finally, the Group's performance has been acclaimed by the financial markets, or at least
recognized, with a total return for shareholders of more than 36% over the course of
2013. These results mean that we will propose a dividend of EUR1.3 per share at the
annual general meeting of shareholders. This dividend increase, which continues the
regular upward trend observed throughout the past few years, brings the total dividend
paid to our shareholders since 2005 to approximately EUR1.5b.
This is sustained by the Group's capacity to generate results and substantial cash flow
over the long term. Thus, more than EUR2.1 billion of cash flow has been generated over
the last three years. With a high rate of total return for shareholders, 14% per annum on
average over the period 2005 to 2013, with a low volatility, SCOR offers a unique
proposition of value creation. And this is what the graph illustrates on slide 7; the optimal
zone is on the top left hand side and this is where we are positioned.
Let me now hand over to Mark Kociancic, Group CFO, who will take you through the
financial details of these results before going to the business engines' results. Mark, you
have the floor.

Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Thank you, Denis. Moving on to page 9, I'll walk you through the highlights of the 2013
results. SCOR wrote more than EUR10.2 billion of gross written premiums during the year,
which represents a 7.8% increase at current exchange rates, fuelled by healthy SCOR
Global P&C renewals since the beginning of the year, by the strength of the SCOR Global
Life franchise, whose teams have signed several major contracts, and by the Generali US
contribution of EUR209 million for the Fourth Quarter. At constant exchange rates the
premium growth reaches 11.5%, highlighting once again the growth story of the Group
despite the depreciation of the dollar throughout 2013.
The net income reaches a record EUR549 million for the year, which generates an 11.5%
return on equity or 12.4% if we exclude the equity impairments.
Both SCOR Global P&C and SCOR Global Life delivered an operational performance
which is already trending towards Optimal Dynamics assumptions. The P&C combined
ratio for the full year stands at 93.9%, in line with the indications for 2013 given in the
Optimal Dynamics plan and the Life technical margin reaches 7.3%, also trending towards
the Optimal Dynamics assumptions. Finally, SCOR Global Investments delivers a return on
invested assets excluding equity impairments of 3.1%, while slightly increasing the duration
of the investment portfolio.
On page 11 you'll find a clear picture of the Generali US acquisition contribution to the Q4
published and pro forma accounts. The net income coming from Generali US stands at
EUR193 million including a gain on purchase, or badwill, of EUR183m, and an operating
performance net if tax of EUR10m. For more details please refer to the appendices, page

27. On page 12, the successful US Generali acquisition and integration enlarges the scale
of the Group. On a pro forma basis the gross written premium for the Group would reach
EUR10.9b, total assets would have increased to EUR34.2 billion and net income would
have been EUR571m.
Moving on to page 13, the shareholders' equity stands at just below EUR5 billion after a
payment of EUR223 million of cash dividends during the Second Quarter of 2013. During
the year the book value per share has increased, reaching EUR26.64 at year-end.
One note regarding financial leverage, it stands at 21.2% as at December 31, after the
issuance of our CHF250 million hybrid perpetual subordinated debt during Q3. Since the
beginning of the year SCOR also repurchased a portion of its subordinated floating rate
debt by acquiring a total face value of $46 million at an average price below 90% of par.
Lastly, you may recall we entered into a bridge loan facility for $228 million on October 1 to
help finance the Generali transaction and I'd like to point out, even though it's not a Q4
event, this loan was entirely paid back in Q1 of 2014.
On page 14 you can see the record operating cash flow, which increased by 18%
compared to last year to reach EUR897 million thanks to the strong contribution of both
business engines.
Now I'll turn it over to Victor for the P&C results.

Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Good morning. We are now on page 15 of the presentation that details the commercial
performance and the technical results of the P&C division for the full year 2013. As you
can see, both the commercial performance and the technical results are in line with or
better than our projections and objectives. They are giving us a good base from which to
implement our new plan for the next three years.
On the commercial side the gross written premiums for the full year stand at EUR4.85b.
We are showing a growth of the gross written premiums by more than 4%, which is
corresponding to more than 8% at constant exchange rates. This compares well with our
projections, whether they are retrospectively by reference to the Strong Momentum plan,
or prospectively as part of the new Optimal Dynamics plan.
In addition, this growth is well spread across the three main business units of the division.
Treaty P&C which accounts for about 54% of the total gross premiums has the largest
progression, up 5% and 9% respectively, that is to say at annual versus constant exchange
rates. Whilst the specialty lines are at the average of the division and business solution is
slightly below, at 3% and 6% respectively.
In treaty P&C the growth is mainly driven by proportional property and to a lesser extent
by casualty, whilst motor is stable. In the specialty lines the largest increases are recorded
in our Lloyds business and in agriculture whilst the activities in construction and the senior
liability are logically the most effected by the crisis.

FINAL

With regard to the geographies, the main increases at constant exchange rates are
located in Asia, Germany and Latin America. Within Asia the largest contributors are China,
India and, to a lesser extent, Singapore because of the regional programs of certain
global and international insurers.
On the technical side the net combined ratio stands at 93.9% for the full year. It is the
resultant of two factors. First factor is that despite the competitiveness of the market we
are able to continue to have a very active portfolio management and to improve the
business mix overall and by client. The second is the good timing of our initiatives like the
one we launched in 2012 towards global insurers and the very positive responses they
have received from the clients and their brokers.
Regarding the global insurers initiative, not only it brings a positive contribution but also it
has expanded beyond the segment of the global insurers as a number of large
international and regional as well as national mid-sized insurers have followed earlier and
faster than we had expected the same path of reconsideration of their reinsurance
purchase and the restructuration of their reinsurance programs.

Bloomberg Transcript

This bold movement, triggered by all the studies that are being made around solvency
and capital management, is offering us opportunities to make the most efficient use of
the strengths of our organization, strengths of this organization that has proven to be
able to be fast to mobilize itself and to leverage our teams and centers of expertise in an
effective and flexible way to adapt and respond to the need of clients when they move
towards a more global and centrally controlled purchase of their reinsurance.
Looking at the components of the net combined ratio, again there is a lot of continuity
and consistency in the trends that are reported. The net attritional loss ratio continues to
improve and the 57.7% achieved in 2013 include only a marginal reserve release affected
in Q2. Considering the current business mix and the opportunities to further manage and
improve it even in today's market conditions, we are confident that the targets set in
Optimal Dynamics are reachable.
The impact from nat cat losses that comes out in the middle of the 6% to 7% range is
consistent with the hypothesis of an increased budget of 7% in the new plan. It is worth
mentioning that the nat cat load for this year is generated by the occurrence of multiple
medium-severe intensity storms, including hail and floods, that have mostly affected
Europe throughout the year and Canada in the summer.
The impact of large man-made losses has been contained by the underwriting discipline
that is applied by all the business units potentially exposed to such losses, which consist
in, one, paying a lot of attention to maintaining balances in the portfolio; two, to be as
vigilant as possible to keep the accumulations from all business units under control; and
three, to respect the risk tolerances before and after retrocessions.
The three main business engines, namely treaty P&C, specialty lines and business
solutions, are producing good technical profit margins that are well in line with their
respective objectives under the operating plan. The largest contributions are coming from
Page 5 of 22

Date: 2014-03-05

FINAL

the property cat segment, business solutions, our business at Lloyds, and treaty P&C
markets such as USA, Asia and France.
As a conclusion, the two trends that are shown on slide 16 are a very good picture of what
has been achieved since we saw the crisis coming and we entered into an operating
mode that has been driven by the clear objective to improve the technical performances
in order to counterbalance the impact of the crisis on the financial side of the revenue
generation.
To achieve this we invested a lot in building all the infrastructure and the practices that are
required to have a culture of portfolio management at all levels of aggregation in the P&C
division and the demonstrated ability to form worldwide deal teams to quickly adapt and
respond to the transformation of the reinsurance strategy and policies of any given client
or prospect we consider as valuable and fitting in with our risk appetite.

Bloomberg Transcript

The investments we made are paying off. We have positioned SCOR as a first-tier
reinsurer and a core partner in reinsurance panels that are getting more compact under
the pressure on buyers to closely monitor the financial security of the counterparties, to
value the willingness to pay beyond the ability to pay, and to ensure the cash flows are
recoverable following major losses and to make savings on the handling costs. All these
considerations are leading to significant and large efforts being made to simplify and
rationalize the reinsurance programs and their placements.
We view this ongoing and rapidly spreading tiering or bifurcation of the reinsurance
market as a major and transformational change in the industry with the implication that will
translate in differentials or contrasts in access to business and quality of performances
over time. Without minimizing the impact of the inflows of new capital and the challenge
from the new coming capacities, they need to be put into context in comparison to the
tiering. As a matter of fact, the overlap and the direct competition with traditional
providers of risk financing and ultimately risk transfer solutions may be more sensitive in
retrocession than in reinsurance.
Simultaneously, the impact and the challenges of this potential competition need also to
be seen having in mind how complementary they can be in the longer run and how
significant they can be in the near future for global diversified reinsurers. In view of the
expansion of the known and emerging risks that are partially transferred or not
transferred at all today by insurers, the complementarity seems to be a given for the midterm.
Currently, and as an illustration of the depth and breadth of the current penetration of the
segment where a global diversified reinsurer life co operates, we estimate in single-digit
the proportion of our P&C premiums that are put under pressure because of the activities
of alternative forms of capital. On this note and having achieved what we have achieved
over the past six years, and in particular in 2013 and at the 1/1/2014 renewals, I believe that
we have good reasons to be positive for the future and to have trust in the successful
completion of our part of SCOR 6 strategic plan.

I'll now let Paolo and Gilles present you the results of the life division and their convictions
in the future of their business. Thank you.

Paolo De Martin

{BIO 15930577 <GO>}

Thank you, Victor. In 2013 SCOR Global Life has posted record growth with total gross
written premiums reaching EUR5.4 billion for the total year on a published basis or more
than EUR6 billion if we include Generali US premiums on a pro-forma basis.
Over the last three years SCOR has vastly increased its global footprint in the life
reinsurance market. Our worldwide portfolio has more than doubled during the last three
years from the EUR3 billion we were writing in 2010. We have achieved this by successfully
combining organic and external growth. On one side, we have kept growing our strong
European franchise by continuing to expand our leading market position in several
European countries and we have significantly expanded our Asian franchise. On the other
side, through the successful acquisition of Transamerica Reinsurance portfolio in 2011 and
then Generali US in 2013, we've been able to reach a leadership position in the US
market.

Bloomberg Transcript

Equally important, if not even more important, is the fact that this dynamically combined
organic and external growth has been achieved without comprising the profitability of the
division. This last year 2013 is a great example of this and I will pass it over to Gilles now
who will guide you guide you through the details of SCOR Global Life results on page 17.

Gilles Meyer

{BIO 3949646 <GO>}

Thank you, Paolo. This is exactly what happened during 2013 where we have been able to
take advantage of a number of opportunities in the life reinsurance market, enabling us to
have a record premium growth of 14.5% at constant exchange rate and reach a premium
volume of EUR5.4 billion on a published basis.
This is thanks notably to the acquisition of the Generali US book, which contributes 4.3
percentage points to the total growth, but in fact the vast majority of the premium
increase in 2013 is due to a strong organic growth of our portfolio, which contributed for
10.2 percentage points. The pockets of growth, of strong double-digit growth in 2013
were in the UK and Ireland, especially on the longevity sector, in Spain in the traditional life
sector mainly thanks to the so-called value-in-force monetization deals we did there, as
well in Asia mainly on the life financing niche.
These strong areas of growth more than offset the negative impact of exchange rates -we have a negative impact of roughly EUR160 million -- as well as the selective portfolio
decrease we did in our health portfolio in the Middle East, which we scaled down at the
last renewal due to unsatisfactory terms and conditions. In France and Northern Europe
too we slightly decreased and reduced our disability and personal accident books.
Our strong pipeline of potential deals have materialized to a large extent during the last
quarter of 2013, which enabled us to record an exceptionally high new business

FINAL

production for the entire year 2013. All the three strategic market segments, namely
protection, financial solutions and longevity, have contributed to this strong new
production. This once again confirms the dynamism of our franchise and our leading
market position in the largest life reinsurance markets of the world.
Regarding the result, we record a robust technical margin of 7.3% including a 0.1% nonrecurring positive item, with all strategic segments contributing to the positive result. This
performance is very stable compared to 2012 and is in line with our new three-year plan,
Optimal Dynamics. On the next slide you will see that it's not only 2012, but it's over also a
long period of six years we have been very stable in the technical margin. So we were
able to combine quite an important growth, doubling the portfolio over the last four
years, and maintaining a technical margin within a very narrow band.
I will pass the word now to Francois for the SCOR Global Investment result on page 19.

Francois de Varenne

{BIO 7447858 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Gilles. SCOR's total investment portfolio reaches EUR23.4 billion at the end of
the December 2013, with an invested asset portfolio of EUR15.2 billion compared to
EUR14 billion at the end of 2012. This represents a growth rate of 9% in 2013, mainly
supported by the Generali US acquisition.
Throughout 2013 SGI has maintained a prudent investment strategy. In particular, the
quality of the fixed income portfolio has been maintained, with a stable average rating of
AA-minus. At December 31, 2013 expected financial cash flows on the fixed income
portfolio over the next 24 months stand at EUR6.1 billion including cash and short-term
investments, facilitating dynamic management of the reinvestment policy.
In 2013 the invested asset portfolio has generated a financial contribution of EUR372m.
The active management policy practiced by SCOR Global Investments has enabled the
Group to record capital gains of EUR130 million in 2013.
The Group has rigorously applied its amortization and impairment policy to its investment
portfolio. Impairments stand at EUR97 million in 2013, of which EUR64 million apply to
equities which are net asset value neutral. The Third Quarter of 2013 marked the end of
equity impairments impacting the profit and loss statement. At current market levels
SCOR does not expect further impairments on the equity portfolio.
Excluding equity impairments, the ongoing return on invested assets reaches a robust
3.1% for the full 2013.
Moving on to slide 20, SCOR considers that the current economical and financial
environment has slightly improved but remains uncertain. In such a context SCOR Global
Investment has continued its policy of progressively reallocating its liquidity while
selectively increasing the duration of the fixed income portfolio in line with the direction of
the strategic plan, Optimal Dynamics.

FINAL

Thus, cash and short-term investments have been reduced by 4 points over the last
quarter and reinvested mainly within the fixed income portfolio as well as in corporate
loans, infrastructure loans and real estate loans. The duration of the fixed income portfolio
reaches 3.4 years, excluding cash, at the end of December 2013 compared to 2.9 years at
the end of June 2013 and 2.7 years at the end of December 2012. This increase in
duration is mainly on GBP and USD dominated portfolios.
As you can see on the table on the right part of the slide, the main driver of the decrease
of the ongoing return is the interest rate environment. Thanks to its active management,
SGI has been able over the last few years to compensate part of this massive interest
rate reduction since our return on our invested assets has decreased much less than the
risk-free rates.
It should be noted that for the full year 2014 our current reinvestment rate is increasing,
with a pick-up of 40 basis points compared to the average 2013 recurring yield. In 2014
we will pursue a rebalancing program along two axes in order to achieve higher
investment results by 2016, the progressive and selective reallocation of the investment
portfolio towards its strategic asset allocation, and the progressive rematching of the
fixed income portfolio towards a target effective duration.
And now I will hand over to Denis Kessler for the conclusion of the presentation.

Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Thank you, Francois. The environment in which we operate today is obviously not static.
Amongst these developments, some are positive, some others are more challenging,
certainly some of them are eventually negative. But whatever the case may be, we
believe that our strategy today positions us well to make the most of the situation.
Among recent developments, financial risks in emerging countries naturally raise the issue
of exposure to these risks. In actual fact our exposure represents just 3% of assets -- I'm
talking about emerging countries -- essentially to ensure ALM congruence, and exposure
represents only 2% of our shareholders' equity. So the crisis of emerging markets is for
SCOR a non-event.
The tough P&C pricing environment is a second challenge, but thanks to its diversified
portfolio and its status as a tier-one reinsurer, SCOR recorded strong renewals in January,
with premium growth of 5% and stable expected net technical profitability.
The third challenge, linked to the previous one, has been mentioned by Victor, is
increasing weight of alternative capital sources in P&C reinsurance. Because of our
business mix, again, we are only exposed to direct competition from these market
instruments on a small proportion of our premiums. Moreover, we believe that (technical
difficulty) an opportunity that we're already seizing, whether in terms retrocession or thirdparty management.

FINAL

And the last development, which I already mentioned, is clearly positive, where insured
clients increasingly want to have a core set of global reinsurers present virtually
everywhere in the world offering a wide range of reinsurance products and services. And
SCOR, with its global presence and its reputation, is part of the inner circle of reinsurers
with special access to clients, thus the famous tiering hypothesis.
Taking account of all these elements, we confirm the Optimal Dynamics objectives, both
in terms of profitability, 1,000 basis points above the risk-free rate, and in terms of
solvency, a solvency ratio of between 185% and 220% according to our internal model.
Similarly, our shareholder remuneration policy remains unchanged and this year we'll
propose a dividend of EUR1.3 per share to the general assembly.
With this I would like to pass over to Antonio for the start of the Q&A session. Antonio?

which we are planned to attend over the remainder of 2014. With this we can start the
Q&A and I would like to remind you to please keep it at two questions maximum. Thank

Q - Jason Kalamboussis

{BIO 4811408 <GO>}

Yes, hi. Good morning. A couple of questions. The first one is on the P&C side we have
seen some peers sharply increase their guidance for reported combined ratios. Now
some can be justified from their mix or expected direction of their mix, but there remains
nonetheless a sharp deterioration. You seem to be very confident to stick to your targets.
Just what do you think could throw you slightly off, not off your target, but could make you
go towards the higher end on the combined ratio?
And the other thing is on the life side, on the technical margin, Generali has shown a 7.7%
technical margin for 2013. Do you find that's likely to be sustained and was it at such high
levels in the previous years or is there anything that -- how should we expect that to
develop basically? Thank you.

FINAL

I think we've demonstrated that we know how to manage our portfolio. And I think our
planning, budgeting and delivering has been pretty much stable and satisfactory year on
year so I myself feel comfortable with where we are. Our reserves are at best estimate
with the same margin as last year, while our business is growing and we have
opportunities to improve the business mix. So I only see unexpected losses, exceptional
losses that could basically put us out of track.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

And on the life technical margin of Generali USA?

A - Gilles Meyer

{BIO 3949646 <GO>}

Yes. The 7.7% is due to some positive results and positive trends on the mortality side on
the Generali US portfolio. In terms of looking forward, I'd like to reiterate the indication
that we gave during Optimal Dynamics, with the 7% indication we've given there. The
performance of Generali US is already factored in that number when we gave that
indication so that's where we believe, with all the portfolio mix evolution we have, that's
where our technical margin will be trending over time.

Hi. I've got two questions, one on capital and one on investments. Your target -- your
capital came in above your target range at 221%. I know it's only 1% above. Could you give
some thoughts on, if you begin to exceed that number significantly, what you might
consider doing there?
And also what yield you're building in to your forward earnings expectations into the 221%
ratio.
Just on investments, we've probably had this number before, but could you give target
duration on fixed income? So I know it was 3.4 year to date, but what that could go to?
Thanks.

Mark on the capital management.

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Yes. So we unveiled a new solvency metric on the IR day last September and we provided
a target range of solvency for the Group in which we're providing the expected rate of

FINAL

protection or solvency to our stakeholders. And as you point out, we're just slightly above
the range at 221%; it's really immaterial. I think when we're in that range of 185% to 220%
that we combine -- it's kind of a sweet spot for us, we combine profitability and the
solvency target.
If we were to exceed the 220% range in any significant and sustained fashion, we outlined
some actions that we could take, which would largely encompass capital return options,
either increasing the dividend potentially, a special dividend if circumstances warranted or
repatriation of capital. But those are more unlikely scenarios. I think the other side of it is
we did in Optimal Dynamics point out that we think we can grow profitably with 1,000
basis points of return target metric in there. So I do expect us to utilize the solvency
capital that we have over the three-year plan.

The target durations we mention in the presentation of Optimal Dynamics last
September. The target duration for the economic balance sheet, that's for the total
Group 4.2 years. But that's for the total invested asset portfolio, so which means for the
fixed income portfolio the target is a little bit higher. It's more in the range of 5.3, 5.5
years.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Hi there. Two quick questions. First of all, you kindly provided the reinvestment rate, 2.6%.
I just wanted to clarify, is that a running yield reinvestment rate? You're not assuming any
or are you assuming any capital gains in that number? Is there anything unusual about it
year to date? But have you been investing in particularly high-yielding assets year to date?
So just give us a bit more granularity behind that 2.6% and where, based on what the yield
curve's done year to date, you'd expect that to be going.
Second question. On the life business, you had a big pick up in year-on-year growth in Q4,
I guess even bigger if I was to FX adjust it. I think you mentioned that a lot of that was
longevity-related and a feed through of a pipeline. Does that mean that that'll have, as
you earn through, maybe there'd be negative impact early in 2014 on the technical
margin? Or maybe just give us some color as to how quickly earnings from that recent
top-line growth feed through to the bottom line. Is there anything particularly unusual
about that growth? Thanks.

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Thanks Andrew. Francois on the reinvestment rates.

FINAL

A - Francois de Varenne

{BIO 7447858 <GO>}

So how we computed this reinvestment rate, that's based on the 2014 roadmap we've
got on the investment portfolio, and that's based on the current rate spread and forward
rates. So that's not where we invest today, so that's the average reinvestment yield of the
cash or cash, financial cash flows over the full 2014 year. So it includes only income and fair
value by income yield, but excludes amortization, impairments and capital gains.
So it should be compared to the recurring yield of the full year 2013. And you've got all
the information in the appendix on slide 51. And this average yield for, recurring yield for
2013 is 2.2%, if we exclude the exceptional item linked to the MRM acquisition and the
badwill for 19 basis points. And that's the same recurring yield that we observed in Q4
2013 as well.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

That 2.6% is a weighted average expected number for 2014 based on observed spreads
today. Is that --

A - Francois de Varenne

{BIO 7447858 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And spreads, yes. But not the average yield of the portfolio. That's the average
reinvestment yield for the full year 2014.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Yes. No. I know. But I guess it makes the assumption that current yields and spreads don't
change. Is that right? It makes an assumption on future asset mix, but it's using observed
market levels today. Is that right?

A - Francois de Varenne

{BIO 7447858 <GO>}

Yes. That's based on current market levels.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay. So if nothing else changes, based on your planned asset reallocation that you've
talked about, the weighted average reinvestment yield would be 2.6%, if nothing --

A - Francois de Varenne

{BIO 7447858 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Right. Got it. Understood. That's clear. Thanks.

On the life development at Q4?

FINAL

A - Gilles Meyer

{BIO 3949646 <GO>}

Yes. On the life development, it's better if we step back and look at the entire year.
Overall we had about 14.5%, if you look at the overall growth on a constant exchange rate
we had about 14.5% growth. 4.5 percentage points is Generali USA acquisition. Then
about 6 percentage points is driven by our inroads in financial solutions. Then you have 2%
longevity and 2% protection. That's how you make up that 14.5 percentage of overall
growth.
In terms of the dilution over the technical margin as the business mix is shifting slightly to
the financial solutions and to longevity, that is factored in again on our Optimal Dynamics
target, target indication that we gave in September, with around a 7% technical margin. So
you will see that happening in 2014 as we transition to this new business mix from the
7.3% where we are now.

{BIO 16462204 <GO>}

Hi. It's Maciej from Morgan Stanley. Thanks for taking my question. On slide, I think it's slide
20, yes it might be slide 20, you show the risk-free rate at the end of 2013 and also give
us that running yield of 2.6%. My question is looking back at your plan optimal dynamics, it
looked like you were expecting a 0.8% spot rate, a risk-free rate, at the end of 2013. Then
you expected it to rise about 1 -- to 1.4% by the end of this year. I'm just wondering -- and
so far yields have fallen 30 basis points rather than rising so far.
I'm just wondering, that 3.1% target that you had, if you had to recalculate it today based
on the current market rate, would it come out to 3.1% still despite the yield moves or
would it be at a lower level, and can you make that up in some other way?

FINAL

So you see on the table, on the right part of the slide, two effects. The first one, that's the
massive decrease risk-free interest rate since 2010. And the fact that what we start to
observe today at the end of 2013 and that we see in forward rates today for 2014, 2015
and 2016, that's an increase of risk-free rate. Having said this, you see the green line in
the middle of the table, which is the average of the last four years of interest rate, is still
decreasing due to the lag effect in the moving average.
We recomputed our investment assumption for the next three years and at this stage,
given market levels, we still maintain the assumption of delivering a return on invested
assets above 3% by the end of 2016.

Q - Maciej Wasilewicz

{BIO 16462204 <GO>}

Okay, because I guess that that 0.7%, you were expecting 0.8% and then yields are down
another 30 basis points, but I guess the yield curve might have, the forward rate curve
might have steepened in that time. Is that what offset that or is it that you're investing in a
more favorable mix than you were expecting at the Optimal Dynamics plan, because it
looks just -- sorry, go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Francois de Varenne

{BIO 7447858 <GO>}

You know in the strategic asset allocation, we have ranges of asset classes, so which
means we actively position the portfolio to take opportunities where we see
opportunities. And the beauty of the portfolio today is the fact that we are invested in
many different currencies. And for instance, we started to increase the duration of the
GBP and USD buckets, where we invest today between 7 and 10 years. We invest, as you
know, in loans as well, where we see many opportunities and still very attractive spreads
and margins.

Hello. Thank you very much. First of all, could you just give us an indication of how the
actual versus expected mortality losses are developing in the Transamerica portfolio of a
couple of years ago? Presumably it's still actually better than expected because there's no
reference to any problems, but I just wonder if you could give us some indication on that
and if there's been any change year on year in that portfolio.
Then, secondly, just a clarification. On that slide 22, when you talk about just 3% exposure
to emerging market currencies, I don't really understand that ratio because you do a lot of
business in Asia and so I'm not quite sure why that ratio is as small as that. So can you just
help me understand what that number actually means? Thank you.

Yes. I think, William, the (technical difficulty) actual versus expected. I think throughout the

the end of the year so at this point we're very comfortable with where we are in the
Transamerica portfolio. Now going forward we really look at the two portfolios joined and
in that case we feel even more comfortable with where the joint portfolio is.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

And on the exposure to --

A - Francois de Varenne

{BIO 7447858 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So just to come back on the figures on slide 22, so on the asset side, we have two
different types of exposure to emerging markets. The first one, as mentioned on the
slide, in an exposure that is linked to our strict policy of congruence between assets and
liabilities, so which means at SCOR we invest on the asset side exactly in the same
currency as on the liability side in the technical reserves. So this exposure at the end of
December 2014 is of EUR339 million and is mainly made of local government bonds and
money market funds.
Our second type of exposure in emerging markets is taken through, let's say, our view
and our wish to be exposed to emerging markets in terms of securities but denominated
in our currencies, in euro or USD. We reduce significantly our exposure to emerging
market 18 months ago and it currently stands at around EUR120m. So the overall exposure
to emerging markets within the invested asset portfolio represents 3% of the portfolio, of
which 2.25% for congruency policy and 0.75% in emerging market funds.

Hi. Good morning. This is Vinit here at Goldman Sachs. Just on P&C growth, Victor, you
mentioned one market which caught my attention. This is Germany. And I think this has
been a market you've been trying to grow as well for the last few years and some
renewals we can check that there's been a 10% to 15% even growth over the last two
years. I'm just wondering if you could comment on anything more on helping us
understand how this growth is coming about, maybe using Germany as an example and
from a broader perspective P&C?

Page 16 of 22



Company N ame: SCOR SE

And second thing is one very minor question on FX. In the investment income this year, a
large charge and FX losses in Fourth Quarter. I was wondering if Francois could just
comment on that given that we just heard the exposure is fairly limited. Thank you.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

FINAL

Thanks Vinit. Maybe on the German marketplace P&C, Victor?

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

In Germany it's a combination of two things, the work that has been done year after year
for quite a number of years now to expand our penetration of the market, in particular in
the mid-sized area. And the second is the successful implementation of the global
insurance initiative. So you combine the two and you get to where you are. I think we still
have in Germany a potential to improve the positions, but I think it's moving in the right
direction.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Sure. And there's no pricing -- the reason I ask it because people say to us that SCOR
might be pricing and this is why you're getting more business. Just to put our minds at
rest, there is no -- this is more recognition of more leadership positions on the contracts
rather than pricing, right, just to reconfirm?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

You would have to segment the market in Germany and see how the market was affected
by the natural catastrophe. And I think that the response of the market to the natural
catastrophe is commensurate to how much each and every sitting company has or hasn't
been affected and how its reinsurance program was affected. So I think there is certainly a
disconnect between the image we have of the natural catastrophe and the impact it had
on the reinsurance programs.
So I think you need really to take pretty specific approach of each sitting company making
a large difference between the global insurers and the top band of insurers in Germany
having a widespread national business or even international, and the more regional ones
that, for some of them, have been much more seriously hit by the natural catastrophe
than the average of the market and was able to absorb it, at least from a reinsurance
standpoint (technical difficulty).

FINAL

Vinit, on the FX, most of that movement, it's roughly EUR10 million in the quarter. Most of
that movement is a result of really hedge effectiveness. We hedge on a quarter -- we set
our hedges on a quarterly basis within the Company and so I would give you a range of
anywhere between zero and EUR10 million in either direction in terms of hedge
effectiveness. We had some positives, for example, in Q3. We had some negatives here
in Q4. But it's really normal volatility in this process and if you look at it over a longer term
it tends to balance out.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

So these are active hedges, not just asset liability, natural hedge?

Yes. Good morning. I have got two questions, one for Victor, one for Francois. First
question for Victor would be on the -- in 2013 we've seen small cat and large man-made
risk frequency increasing. Could you please comment on the potential impact on your
attrition or loss ratios in 2013?
And potentially if you could comment on the trend and if there is, I would say, anything to
worry about for 2014 and 2015, maybe with a pick up of (technical difficulty) recovery or, I
don't know. So if you could please comment on the potential beginning of a trend.
And sorry, the question for Francois would be, coming back to the 2.6% expected
reinvestment yield for 2014, could you tell us what has been the average reinvestment
yield on the full year 2013, so how the 2.6% will compare for 2013?
And what would be the effect of the 2.6% on your guidance for return on investment for
2014, including capital gains realization? Thank you.

FINAL

I don't think there is a trend in large man-made losses. I think that's a bit like natural
catastrophe. It happens and some years you've got more of them and some years you've
got less of them. I don't think we can see a crisis-related pattern, for instance, in the
occurrence of those losses.
I think you can certainly analyze the losses and see which companies are affected, insurers
in particular. Then you can draw some conclusions regarding the underwriting policy of
each and every, and then it's up to you as a reinsurer to select your partners.
I think as I said in my speech, I think the way we've gone through that relatively immune, in
bracket -- we have our share of it but that didn't really affect our attritional or the part of
our attritional that is related to that -- is linked to the way we manage our underwriting in a
sense that we have a control of accumulation because those large losses are generally
coming from many angles in a large global diversified reinsurer. We see them for today
[ph]. We can see them from our facultative operation and large corporate operation. They
can come from many sources.

Bloomberg Transcript

I think we have a management of our accumulation. We have a management of the
balance in the portfolio. And we have a retrocession policy that protects us against those
losses. So you combine the three and for the moment, well, we think that we have the
situation under control. And I see no reason for us to think that 2014 would be behaving
different from 2013. If you refer, for instance, to the shares we have of some of the large
published-in-the media losses, like the Costa Concordia or things like that, you can see
that we've been able to manage the impact of those losses on the net basis to the
Company. And I think we intend to continue that.
We are making even more efforts today with our cedents to try to identify the large risk in
every market and to get through a system that we are developing currently and putting in
place, market by market, a vision of all the streams of commitments that we get on the
largest risk for each and every market. This is part of the underwriting information we are
more and more asking to our cedents and getting computed and aggregated within our
underwriting management business.

A - Francois de Varenne

{BIO 7447858 <GO>}

Thomas, to answer to your questions, so the first one is the comparison of the average
reinvestment yield. So if you move to the slide 51, you can see that the recurring yield, so
with the definition income and fair value by income only in 2012 was 2.4. In 2013, if we
exclude the exceptional item linked to the valuing of MRM, it's 2.2.
You know that in 2013 we maintained a huge amount of cash and we started to put, to
reinvest the cash in the second part of the year. Book yield of the fixed income portfolio -market yield of the fixed income portfolio in 2013 was in the range of 1.6%, 1.7%. So let's
say the average reinvestment yield in 2013 was in the region of 2%.
For the guidance of 2014, so you know that just -- it's not a guidance; it's an assumption
based on the current market level. And I don't like to comment on the constituents of the

Page 19 of 22



Company N ame: SCOR SE
Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity
Date: 2014-03-05

return on invested assets, such as the recurring yield or the realized gains, and we prefer
to concentrate on the total return on invested assets as a whole.

FINAL

As you know and it was mentioned in the slide, year after year we are affected by the
massive and brutal decrease of interest rate. And as a benchmark, the moving average of
the full-year risk-free rate weighted by euro [ph] currency mix in our portfolio, was at 1.5%
in 2010, 1.4% in 2011 and dropped to a (technical difficulty).
So it's early to have a view on full year 2014. But the expectation or the assumption at this
stage is return on invested asset in the range of 2.4%, 2.9%. And given its current
defensive positioning and its relatively short duration, the investment portfolio should,
however, benefit much faster from improved market conditions. You have to compare this
range, 2.4%, 2.9% to the normalized 2013 return on invested assets, which is 2.9% if you
exclude the 19 basis points of the MRM valuing.

Thank you. Good morning, everybody. I have two questions. My first question is on your
reserve situation. As we had only a small impact from reserve releases in 2013, the
question is whether you comment on, could comment on how you see your overall
reserve situation now.
And also related to this, whether you might have reached now a point where we will come
to a status where we should expect more regular reserve releases going forward. This is
my first question.
And second question is, as we are ahead of April renewals, is whether you could
comment on what your expectations are and then how do you position yourselves there.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Thank you, Frank. Frieder, on the situation of the reserves? So Frieder is the new CRO of

A - Frieder Knuepling
Yes. The reserve situation is pretty much unchanged compared to one year before. As
always, we've done a thorough review on an annual basis and gone through all avenues

in the past.

really a few, give a few trends, Victor?

FINAL

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Well just one point maybe on the reserves. I think over the last six years the results we've
presented are the true results of our business. We have not used reserve release or
whatever. We were not basically, during the hard market 2002/2005, we were not there
in a position to accumulate. So I think what you see from the results is two results and with
very marginal reserve release. So that's a comment, we are not.
Regarding April, I think April is for big majority an Asian renewal. And each market is
different from the others there. We have a very long presence in Asia and more than 40
years. I think our franchise there is very deep. So I think there is competition like in any
other market, but I think the franchise and the very, very deep relationship we have with
most of the clients are putting us in what I feel is a good position to have very decent
negotiation and discussions with those clients. So this is an ongoing process. I'm not
particularly worried about those renewals.

Good.

FINAL

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

That's in one word. So the answer is no, Jason. And on the cost ratio of 4-point -- sorry,
yes, we plan an average cost ratio of 4.8% over the next three years according to the new
plan. Now for 2014 I turn to Mark, tell us the budget.

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Yes. So as Denis mentioned, we were projecting 4.8% over the three-year plan, Optimal
Dynamics. We've seen a nice trend downwards in our cost ratio over the last few years,
touching 5.07% for a little more precision. Some of that is due to the increasing scale of
the organization. We are getting larger. We do get economies of scale by adding
companies like Generali and leveraging overhead. I think there's also a significant
productivity component as we leverage some of our global systems and so forth. So
those are the two main drivers over time.

Bloomberg Transcript

I would caution on specific figures because we are a global organization and therefore
subject to a little bit of foreign exchange, differences between the US dollar and the euro.
Still feel very confident about 4.8%, but there could be a touch of volatility in the ratio as
we're a little bit overweight in expenses in euro relative to the US dollar, but we definitely
believe we'll reach that target, that goal.

A - Denis Kessler
