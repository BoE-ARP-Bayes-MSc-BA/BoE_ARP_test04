Eric Salsberg

{BIO 1552007 <GO>}

Good morning, and welcome to our call to discuss Fairfax's 2017 third quarter results. This
call may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ perhaps materially
from those contained in such forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of
uncertainties and risk factors, the most foreseeable of which are set out under risk factors
in our base shelf prospectus, which has been filed with Canadian Securities regulators and
is available on SEDAR.
I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Prem Watsa.

Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Thank you, Eric. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Fairfax's third quarter
conference call. I plan to give you some of the highlights and then pass it on as always to
Dave Bonham, our CFO for additional financial details.

FINAL

The third quarter of 2017 reminded us yet again that our industry is a risk business. During
the third quarter, the insurance industry experienced some of the largest catastrophe
losses in its history, as a result of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria and earthquakes in
Mexico. Losses for the property and casualty insurance industry from these catastrophes
are estimated to be perhaps 100 billion plus.
Our companies' share of the losses amounted to $960 million, well within our expectation
that in a year of extreme catastrophe losses, we expect to break even, but will not suffer
any significant loss of capital. Fortunately, the reduction of our shareholding in ICICI
Lombard to about 10% resulted in cash and shares of ICICI Lombard of 1.4 billion and a
net after tax gain of 930 million, and our strategic alliance with MSI will on closing result in
a net after tax gain of about $900 million. Fairfax expects to have an excellent year in 2017
in spite of the catastrophe losses, with cash and marketable securities in our holding
company at record levels and we are prepared if a hard market develops in 2018.
For the first nine months of 2017 book value per share increased by 15.5%, adjusted for
the $10 per share common dividend paid in the first quarter of 2017. Our insurance
companies had a combined ratio of 109% for the nine months, which included 13.5 points
of hurricane losses. Excluding the hurricane losses, our insurance companies had a
combined ratio of 95.5% for the nine months.

Bloomberg Transcript

In the third quarter we had an operating loss of 680 million resulting from the hurricane
losses, but with more than offset by net investment gains of 1.1 billion, which arose
primarily from ICICI Lombard and net gains and other equities of 186 million.
All-in-all we had net earnings of 477 million in the quarter and 871 million in the nine
months. Insurance and reinsurance businesses net premium written was up in the third
quarter of 2017 by 41% primarily due to modest growth of our insurance and reinsurance
operations and the acquisitions of Allied World, Bryte Insurance, AIG's operations in three
Latin American countries and branches in Eastern and Central Europe, and also AMAG.
Excluding the acquisitions, our net premiums written was up 8.3%.
Net investment gains as I said earlier was 1.1 billion in the third quarter consisted of the
following, please refer to page three of our press release. As I mentioned earlier, we
have realized gains of 930 million resulting from the reduction of our shareholdings in
ICICI Lombard. Net gains in other equity exposures of 186 million resulted from net gains
of 240 million -- 241 million on long equities and 55 million net loss on individual short
positions. We have realized gains of 58 million on equities principally from realized gains
on Grivalia property due to the increase in ownership that resulted in consolidation. We
also had gains of 25 million on our bond portfolio, primarily from a municipal bonds.
As we mentioned in our annual meetings, annual reports, quarterly calls, with IFRS
accounting, stocks and bonds are recorded at market and subject to mark-to-market
gains and losses, quarterly and annual income will fluctuate and investment results will
only make sense over the long term.

FINAL

As I said at our AGM, we continue to hold our CPI-linked derivatives with a notional value
of 116 billion, which produced unrealized losses of 19 million in the third quarter. If some of
the unexpected risk come to pass over the next few years, the CPI-linked derivatives
could become very valuable. We will hold them as insurance for some time.
When you review our statements, please remember that when we own more than 20% of
a company, we equity account and when we own about 50%, we consolidate, so that
mark-to-market gains in these companies are not reflected in our results.
As you can see on page 13 of our quarterly report, the fair value of our investment and
associates is 4.2 billion versus a carrying value of 3.5 billion, an unrealized gain of
approximately $600 million that's not on our balance sheet.
During the third quarter of 2017, Fairfax completed the acquisition of AIG's insurance
operations in Chile, Colombia and Argentina. And we continued to work through the legal,
regulatory and operational requirements to complete the required acquisitions in Uruguay
and Venezuela. The acquisitions of AIG's branches in Central and Eastern Europe is now
complete with Romania having just closed.

Bloomberg Transcript

In August, as you know, the company entered into an agreement with Mitsui Sumitomo to
pursue a global strategic alliance. Mitsui Sumitomo will acquire the company's 97.7%
interest in First Capital, for cash proceeds of 1.6 billion, which will result in a realized net
after tax gain of approximately 900 million.
Completion of the sale, anticipated for late 2017 or early 2018, is subject to applicable
regulatory approvals. Fairfax will retain a 25% quota share exposure to First Capital's
insurance portfolio. The definitive agreement has been signed recently and is now subject
to only regulatory approvals. We expect to close by the end of 2017 or early 2018.
In August, Fairfax Africa acquired a 42% equity interest in Atlas Mara for consideration of
156 million. Atlas Mara is a financial services institution listed on the London Stock
Exchange that operates in seven sub-Saharan African countries.
In July, the company increased its equity interest in APR Energy to 68% by acquiring an
additional 23% interest for a purchase consideration of 109 million. Also in July, the
company increased its equity interest in Grivalia Properties of 53% through the acquisition
of an 10.3% equity interest from Eurobank for purchase consideration of 100 million, and
commenced consolidating Grivalia in the other reporting segment. Grivalia is a real estate
company listed on the Athens Stock Exchange.
As I've said at our annual meeting and our conference calls, we believe the US
administrations proposed policies of reducing corporate tax rates more recently to 20%,
rolling back regulation in business like Dodd-Frank, Obamacare and a myriad of other
regulations and significant infrastructure spending has the potential of boosting economic
growth significantly in the United States. Already sentiment among small businesses has
improved dramatically and animal spirits in the United States are alive and well.

FINAL

When the US economy, which is approximately 20 trillion, does well, much of the world
does well too. To us this means our concerns of China or Europe precipitating a
worldwide recession/depression have been significantly reduced, but not eliminated.
Of Course the trade policies of the US could precipitate a collapse in world trade. So,
these risks will be very much monitored by us. But we continue to think the new
administration's policies may make this a stock picker's market and one in which we have
thrived over the past 32 years.
In the past few years, we have played defense. We are and continue to play offense now,
but always with a long-term value oriented investment philosophy. We will continue to pick
good companies, which provide significant downside protection and potential
appreciation over the long-term. As you know, we have invested about 550 million in
bonds or preferred shares with warrants, recently in Chorus, Altius, Mosaic Capital,
Westaim and AGT Foods. We get 5% to 6% plus upside through the warrants.

Bloomberg Transcript

As of September -- end of September 2017, we have 17 billion in cash and short-term
investments in our portfolios, which is 43% of our total investment portfolios to take
advantage of opportunities that come our way. But as a result of the short-term, our
investment income will be reduced. Subsequent to the third quarter, we bought back
approximately 166,000 shares for 87 million at approximately $524 a share.
We recently announced that David Johnston joined us as a Global Advisor. David was
previously an outstanding Fairfax Director and has been a champion for Canadian and
Canadian businesses around the world for over seven years in his role as the General of
Canada. We look forward to having such a great Canadian rejoin the Fairfax team to bring
his integrity, wisdom and insight and his global advisory role.
Now I'd like to turn it over to Dave Bonham, our CFO, so he can give you some more
information on the underlying financials. Dave?

David Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

Thank you, Prem. So, in the third quarter of 2007, Fairfax reported net earnings of $477
million, or about $16 per share on a fully diluted basis and that would compare to the third
quarter in 2016, when we had net earnings of just a $1 million and that worked out with net
loss of $0.42 per share after taking into account preferred share dividends.
Year-to-date in 2017, Fairfax has produced net earnings of 871 million, or $33 per diluted
share, that's an improvement over 2016, when we reported net earnings of 189 million
and that would have been about $6.62 per diluted share.
Underwriting losses at our insurance and reinsurance operations in the third quarter and
first nine months of 2017 were 833 million and 617 million and those produced combined
ratio of 130% and 109% compared to underwriting profits of 175 million and 379 million in
the same period last year.

FINAL

The decrease in quarter-to-date and year-to-date underwriting profits reflected the
impact primarily of the third quarter Hurricanes that being Harvey, Irma, and Maria and
they totaled $929 million on a pre-tax basis. The lower underwriting profit this year was
also reflective of lower net favorable reserve development.
Looking at total current period catastrophe losses in the third quarter of 2017 they totaled
$1 billion and added 37 combined ratio points to the combined ratio and year-to-date
those losses totaled 1.1 billion representing 16 combined ratio points. So those, the total
cats there include the three significant hurricanes that we just mentioned, the Mexican
earthquake and other attritional losses.
By way of comparison cat losses in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 were
just $59 million and $248 million just 3 combined ratio points and 4 combined ratio points
in those respective periods. And yes, last year, the year-to-date included $67 million and
that was the Fort McMurray wildfires.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our combined ratios was benefited from net favorable prior year reserve development in
the third quarter and first nine months of 2017 of $88 million and $299 million that
translated into 3 and 4 combined ratio points respectively, and that compared to the
benefit of somewhat higher net favorable prior year reserve development last year of
$137 million and $397 million representing about 7 combined ratio points in each of those
respective periods last year.
Turning to net premiums written and excluding recent acquisitions, namely Allied World,
Bryte Insurance, AMAG, Fairfirst Insurance and the AIG branches in Latin America and
Central and Eastern Europe, our net premiums written by our insurance and reinsurance
operations increased by 8% in the third quarter, 7% in the first nine months of 2017 and
that primarily reflected growth at Odyssey Re, Northbridge and Crum & Forster.
So, just moving through our operating company results, starting with Northbridge.
Northbridge had an underwriting profit of $2 million in the third quarter, 6 million in the first
nine months and that resulted in a combined ratio of about 99% in each of those periods.
Last year same periods Northbridge had an underwriting profit of 24 million and 27 million
with combined ratios of 90% and 96%. The underwriting results in the third quarter and
first nine months of 2017 included 2 million and 7 million of current period catastrophe
losses - current period catastrophe losses in the first nine months of 2016 were 26 million
and mostly related to the Fort McMurray wildfires.
The underwriting results in Northbridge in the third quarter and first nine months included
the benefit of net favorable prior year reserve development of 31 million and 65 million,
representing 12 and 9 combined ratio points and that compared to a net favorable
development last year of 42 million and 79 million, representing 17 and 12 combined ratio
points. In Canadian dollar terms, net premiums written by Northbridge in the third quarter
and first nine months of 2017 increased by 8% and 10% and that reflected increased
renewal and new business writings combined with modest price increases across
Northbridge.

FINAL

Looking at OdysseyRe; OdysseyRe reported underwriting losses of 168 million and 64
million with combined ratios of 126% and 104% in the third quarter and first nine months of
2007, that compared to underwriting profits of 59 million and 133 million with combined
ratios of 90% and 91% in those respective periods last year.
Current period catastrophe losses mostly related to Harvey, Irma and Maria with the
primary reason for the underwriting losses in the third quarter and first nine months, with
total current period catastrophe losses amounting to $262 million and $316 million in the
third quarter and first nine months, translating into 41 combined ratio points on the
quarter, 18 combined ratio points year-to-date. And that's a significant increase from the
cat losses of 33 million and 135 million in the prior year third quarter and first nine months.
Odyssey's combined ratios in the third quarter and first nine months included the benefit
of $43 million and $110 million of net favorable prior year reserve development at 7 and 6
combined ratio points respectively, and that compared to the benefit of favorable
development last year $45 million and $148 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

Odyssey wrote $662 million and just over $1.9 billion of net premiums in the third quarter
and first nine months respectively. So, that's an increase of 33% in the quarter, 16% yearto-date, reflecting increases in almost all of Odyssey's divisions, except in the Latin
America division.
Crum & Forster; Crum & Forster produced underwriting losses of $18 million and $12
million in the third quarter and first nine months, combined ratios of 104% and 101%
respectively compared to underwriting profits of $7 million and $23 million last year. Net
prior year reserve development was not significant in the third quarters and first nine
months of either 2017 or 2016.
Current period catastrophe losses were $31 million and $41 million in the third quarter and
first nine months, principally related to the Hurricane and the Irma in the third quarter and
that compared to current period catastrophe losses of just $1 million and $17 million in the
third quarter and first nine months of 2016.
Crum & Forster's net premiums written increased by 1% and 3% in the third quarter and
first nine months of 2017 and that's reflective of growth in their accident and health and
commercial transportation lines of business, partially offset by decreases in excess and
surplus in marine lines of business.
Zenith National reported underwriting profits in the third quarter and first nine months of
$34 million and $92 million with combined ratios of 84% and 85% that compared to
underwriting profits last year of $52 million and $115 million in those same respective
periods. Those combined ratios in 2017 in the quarter and year-to-date included 8
combined ratio points and 10 combined ratio points of net favorable prior year reserve
development compared to 15 combined ratio points and 13 combined ratio points in the
third quarter and first nine months of 2016.

FINAL

Zenith wrote a 175 million in the quarter, $677 million in year-to-date net premiums and
that compared to $180 million in the quarter last year, $671 million in the nine months last
year. And the changes in the net premiums written, quarter-over-quarter and year-overyear primarily reflected the interaction between increased exposure and modest price
decreases.
Brit in the third quarter and first nine months, Brit produced underwriting losses of 222
million and 199 million combined ratios of 158% and 118% and that was compared to
underwriting profits of 12 million and 26 million last year. Current period catastrophe
losses in the third quarter and first nine months of 2017 at Brit were 244 million and 245
million respectively, representing 64 combined ratio points in the quarter, 22 combined
ratio points year-to-date comprised mainly of the impact of the third quarter hurricanes.
And that compared to $13 million and $48 million of current period catastrophe losses in
the third quarter and first nine months last year. Net prior year reserve development in Brit
was not significant in any of the third quarters of 2017 or 2016.

Bloomberg Transcript

Brit's net premium written decreased to 5% and 1% in the third quarter and first nine
months of 2017 and that principally reflected the impact of additional reinsurance
purchased, reductions and some of the core lines of business through active portfolio
management, modest price decreases, the unfavorable impact of foreign currency
translation and then that was partially offset by increased contribution from some of the
business initiatives that they have launched in more recent years and some measure
growth in some other core lines of business.
Looking at Allied World; Allied World was acquired on July 6, 2017 and it contributed $541
million to net premiums written since its date of acquisition. Allied World's underwriting
loss of 416 million and it's combined ratio of 182% since July 6, 20 17 were significantly
impacted by $412 million of current period catastrophe losses, representing 82 combined
ratio points and again principally the Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria in the third quarter.
Fairfax Asia's underwriting profit of 15 million and 32 million combined ratios of 82% and
87% were comparable to the same periods in 2016. The combined ratios in the third
quarter and first nine months included $6 million and $32 million of net favorable prior year
reserve development and that compared to 5 million and 35 million in the third quarter
and first nine months of 2016.
Our insurance and reinsurance other segment, it produced underwriting losses of 60
million and 56 million with combined ratios of 131% and 111% in the third quarter and first
nine months of 2017, whereas underwriting profits of 9 million and 18 million and the
combined ratios of 92% and 95% were the results in those same periods in 2016.
Those underwriting results in 2017 were negatively impacted by the current period
catastrophe losses of $67 million and 34 combined ratio points in the third quarter, $81
million and 15 combined ratio points in the first nine months. Again, the third quarter
Hurricanes responsible for majority of those cat losses.

FINAL

Runoff reported operating losses of $15 million and $95 million in the third quarter and first
nine months of 2017, compared to operating losses of 12 million and 28 million in the
same periods in 2016. The increase in the year-to-date operating loss reflects higher net
adverse prior year reserve development and lower interest and dividends both in 2017.
Looking at some of our consolidated results, interest and dividend income in the quarter
increased from 105 million in the third quarter of 2016 to 152 million in the third quarter of
2017 that reflects a contribution from the acquisition of Allied World and lower total return
swap expense in 2017, partially offset by lower interest income earned as a result of our
sales of US treasuries and municipal bonds late in 2016 and the first quarter of 2017.
Fairfax recorded an income tax recovery of $27 million in the third quarter of 2017 and a
provision for income taxes of 42 million in the first nine months of 2017 and that
represented a negative effective tax rate of 8% in the quarter, a positive effective tax rate
of 5% year-to-date. The low effective tax rates relative to the Canadian statutory tax rate,
primarily reflect the $930 million gain on the sale of ICICI Lombard, which is not taxable in
the jurisdiction, where it's held and that creates a significant benefit to our income tax
provision, when compared to the Canadian statutory tax rate of 26.5%.

Bloomberg Transcript

We ended the third quarter with an investment portfolio inclusive of holding company
cash of $39 billion compared to $28 billion at the end of 2016 and as at September 30,
2017 Allied World had contributed approximately $8 billion to the year-over-year increase
that being the consolidation of their investment portfolio.
Our total debt to total capital ratio decreased to 26.9% at September 30th, from 29% at
December 31, 2016, reflecting the increase in our consolidated shareholders' equity and
additional non-controlling interest.
So with that Prem, I'll pass it back to you.
Thank you, Dave. Now, we are happy to answer your questions. Please give us your name,
your company name, try to limit your question to only one. So, that's fair to everyone on
the call. Okay, Iris, we are ready for the questions.

Hi, good morning, Jeff.

FINAL

Q - Jeff Fenwick

{BIO 15350794 <GO>}

So, you mentioned, you reiterated that Fairfax is back on offense with respect to
investments and you had sitting with that very high cash and short-term investments here
balance of 43% of the total. Just wondering if I get your perspective on what the right
level is to work that cash balance down toward? And what would you expect to be a
reasonable time frame for that balance to be deployed as we look forward here?

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Yes, that's, you know, Jeff, that's very difficult to say because it's very opportunistic, it's
looking at one investment at the time. Our cash positions in the past have gone right
down do maybe 10% or so. And so we've got lots of powder, but we did the AGT Foods
an investment in more recently, where we did a bond plus a warrant. There are many,
many investments that they're working on in a similar vein.

Bloomberg Transcript

What we have Jeff is 32-year reputation for treating people well, friendly investments, so
people companies are comfortable giving us 30%, 40% of that company because they
know we will never do anything hostile. And that gives us huge advantage and that's
based on 32 years, as I said, of a very friendly investments.
And we think we like the ones that we've already made that's five of them and we've
invested, I think, I said 550 million. But we keep looking at it, we've got many
opportunities ahead of us and I can't tell you exactly what time frame because it's very
opportunistic value-oriented, but we will be looking to invest. We are playing offense. This
is what we've done for 40 years.
This is our -- this is what we are good at for a long period of time and there's no change
in the management teams and I'm not speaking for myself, but Roger Lace, Brian
Bradstreet, Wade Burton, we've got a very good group of people. But behind it all, is the
fact that our culture is so good, that people want to deal with us, in Canada, in the United
States, and many, many parts of the world, Jeff.

Q - Jeff Fenwick

{BIO 15350794 <GO>}

Okay. And I guess the follow-on with that would be, you have more cash coming in the
door here shortly from the sale of First Capital. You were active on buybacks over the last
quarter here and should we expect that to continue to be a part of the equation going
forward, if you can have $1 billion after-tax gain coming in the door?

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Yes. So, that's about 900 million, I think, you're talking about in terms of First Capital. And
so we've bought back, we've said about 166,000 shares, I think, it is about 87 million. That
certainly, I have said publicly, I said it in the annual meeting Jeff, that's very much what we
want to do. It's subject to share prices.

FINAL

The point I want to make very clearly to all our shareholders is that our book value today is
always has been a first step for what the intrinsic value is, but the difference between
book value and intrinsic value are pretty significant. I mean just look at ICICI Lombard, for
example, 1.4 billion it was very insignificant amounts on our balance sheet. We have
realized a gain of 930 million.
Look at the -- we have been First Capital, and we've got a terrific partnership with Mitsui,
we are working forward on that Jeff. But it was -- 400 million of premium and the track
record was so good that the price we got was 1.6 billion. And 400 million -- the total
premiums in our company is about $14 billion and you look at all the investments we have,
many of them have got tremendous potential that we have yet to realize on.
And so when we put all of that together, Jeff, we think the opportunity is very significant.
So, the link between book value and intrinsic value is probably never been more different
than in the 32 years that we've had because we took a loss in 2016 and our book value
went down, but the underlying fundamentals of our company are very strong.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, I've said, Jeff, that there is a potential of a hard market that might come and here we
have two significant sales, one is the ICICI Lombard, the one is First Capital 1.4 billion and
1, that goes to the holding company of my band [ph] and 1.6 billion on the other that after
expenses, maybe 1. 5 billion goes to the holding company.
So, you're talking about very powerful position, financial position as we meet this market
Most companies have taken a loss in the third quarter and most companies will have
taken a loss in the year that are exposed to reinsurance particularly. And we've got -we've got the ability to take advantage of the market. So, we are very -- we are really very
excited about the possibilities of our company.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

FINAL

Two questions for you. So, first is on Allied World, and I recognize that it's only one quarter
of results, sort of, it have been included so far. But combined ratio of 101, excluding cat
losses, and I know you didn't buy this business and it was assumption for a combined ratio
of 101 going forward.

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

So, wondering kind of what the view, whether its strategic change you can implement, or
just simply waiting for the market cycle to turn? What's your kind of view on that 101
improving going forward?

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, so the 101 in, there was a reserve development of approximately 20 million, which
in our system, we just flow it right through. Their reserve redundancies are very significant,
Paul, but we look at it in the fourth quarter. And you exclude that 20 million and is more
like 96%. The company has a reserve surplus, all our companies are very strongly
reserved. And Allied World is the public company, they've given -- publicly they've said,
they've reserved in excess of what is needed.
And, but in the third quarter they just flow that 20 million right into the numbers and we
really don't worry about it quarter-by-quarter, Scott Carmilani has got one of the best
track records in the business and he have got a great team, Andy and Peter, our Chief
Risk Officer spent a whole day, not only with the top management, but two or three levels
below and we are really excited.
Where I'm facing this market -- these market conditions today, Paul, with a Brit that we
didn't have and which is a big Lloyd's company. And Allied World, which is very
entrepreneurial company in the United states, which writes Fortune 500, Fortune 1000
business. And they are separately capitalized, they run by the same management team at
both these companies. And I got to tell you, we are very excited about the possibilities for
both companies and, of course, our OdysseyRe, which has been stayed stable for a long
time.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Okay, helpful. And then second question is an accounting one. So, on the consolidated
statement of changes in equity, there's a line called other net changes in capitalization
and that number changed significantly from Q2 to Q3 and was a positive benefit to book
value per share of roughly $7 a share, so fairly immaterial. So, just want to understand that
that line better, and what exactly changed quarter-to-quarter?

And Dave, why don't you address that accounting item?

FINAL

A - David Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

Sure. So, what close through that line is when we consolidated subsidiary and then there
are changes in the amount or the ownership percentage of that subsidiary, any dilution
gains or losses get charged directly into our equity through that line item. So, that's what
you're seeing in there.
And in the current period, what's contributing to that, or changes in ownership of Quess.
Like we've got an order in our financials, the talks about additional shares that were
issued by Quess that we didn't participate in and of course there are some activity in
there related to Allied World.

Q - Paul Holden

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Hey, Srijit.

Q - Srijit Banerjee

Hello. So, I have two quick question regarding Fairfax India. So, on October 4th Fairfax
India Inc. created a intention to make a Normal Course Issuer Bid at TSX.

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Yeah.

Q - Srijit Banerjee

{BIO 22134289 <GO>}

To buyback its own share, right. So, question is like, it's Fairfax India buying back its own
share at the current price range, or is it an insurance, when the price below book value.
And second question will be, can you share some update on Sanmar Chemicals?

FINAL

Okay. So, on the buyback, Srijit that's a Normal Course Issuer buyback that we put in. We
always put that in so that it gives us the ability to buy the Fairfax India stock. So, it will be
function of the stock price. It last for a year and give us flexibility to buyback, whenever we
feel like doing it. Doesn't mean we're going to buy it at these prices, we could buy it -- we
don't say what the price will be, but it gives us the flexibility to do that, that's one.
On Sanmar Chemical, they have an operation in Egypt that will come into full production
sometime in the middle of next year. And then they will be, well on their way. There were
PVC producer, as you know, in India, second largest very, very strong, terrific results there.
And as Egypt comes into production, we think Sanmar will do pretty well.
We really like Fairfax India investment it's about approximately eight companies there.
They come out, they come out with their own statements, as you know, and it's run by
Chandran. AT the annual meeting, many of you have met him. And Harsha, who is in India.
Lots of opportunity in India that's a one country we think there is a tremendous
possibilities. And we've got now an established company there. The investments are all
doing well. We have closed the 48% in Bangalore International Airport, with third largest
city in India, very significant investment for us. And we think the possibilities in the future
are very significant for that company.

We have our next question from Junior Ross [ph], from Private Investor. Your line is now
open.

Q - Junior Ross
Good morning, Prem. How is going?

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Hey how are you doing, Junior?

This shelf prospectus for Fairfax --

Q - Junior Ross

FINAL

Financial, yeah.

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Fairfax Financial, yeah, that's just regular thing we do on a regular basis. I think at every
year you have to refresh it and gives us a lot of flexibility, Junior. So, we don't have to, we
can issue stocks, bonds, cash, whatever we want in very quickly. But, I'll tell you, we have
no intention of issuing shares, as I told you we are just the opposite, we're looking at
buying them back.
And our financial position it's perhaps the strongest we've been in a long time and with
these big losses, the other side of these losses, Junior. I'm talking about the hurricane
losses, the catastrophe losses, the California fire losses, the other side of these losses is
the pricing in our business, which has been going down for a long time, might start going
up and coming to where you get paid to take risk. And if you get paid to take risk, our
management teams are well-positioned to do it.

Q - Junior Ross

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Second question is, how is the Torstar investment coming along?
