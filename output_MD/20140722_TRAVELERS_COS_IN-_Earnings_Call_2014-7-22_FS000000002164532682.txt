{BIO 14011069 <GO>}

Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. We're
quite pleased with the strong results we've posted this quarter particularly given the
magnitude of our catastrophe and non-catastrophe weather losses.
Operating income was $673 million or a $1.93 per share. Operating return on equity was
11.4% and we continue to make great progress in lifting our returns largely in response to
continuing very low interest rates and continuing volatile weather.
Who would have thought we'd be talking about a polar vortex in July and a 2.5% 10-year
Treasury in 2014. As demonstrated on slide 4 of the webcast, comparing this quarter's
earnings to last year is more than accounted for by the tax and legal settlement gains of a
$122 million recognized in last year's second quarter as well as the difference in
catastrophe losses quarter to quarter. The short story for each of our business segments
is good. In Personal Insurance, we are really pleased with the market place response and
production trends from our new personal auto program Quantum 2.0.
While we need more talent, more time and data, the very early on loss indications are
encouraging and consistent with our expectations. Our Financial, Professional and
International Insurance segment produced record results with good results from both the
Bond and Financial Products business and the international business. In Business Insurance,
we continue to generate strong returns as underlying underwriting margins on an earned
basis continued to expand and written rate gains in the quarter approximated loss trend.

FINAL

Because there was so much interest in our assessment of the rate environment in
Business Insurance, we're going to spend a few minutes on that this morning before I turn
it over to Jay.
At our recent Investor Day, we were struck by the fact that one analyst asked a question
about rate, but started off by saying that he knew we didn't like talking about aggregate
rate indicators. That's just not so but the critical caveats in discussing the headline rate are
that, first, we do not manage rate in the aggregate. We manage it account by account or
class by class and the actions that we take ultimately add up to a single number. This
granularity is evidenced on slide 15 of the webcast which we've shared with you before.
The slide is the distribution by rate gain of our commercial accounts business for the
second quarter 2014 and Brian will talk more about this analysis later. Second, we believe
that there can be an incorrect assessment of the competitive environment based upon
the direction of the headline number.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let me say again what I've said many times before. We are a return driven organization.
We have talked with you before and have shared with you data which demonstrates that
the success we are having in improving returns is based upon achieving rate gains on our
poor performing business and maximizing retention on our best performing business. And
we have also said before, if we are successful, the headline rate gain will inevitably
decline over time.
There is a conventional reaction amongst many industry observers that this decline
reflects, as many would put it, a more competitive environment. We just don't see it that
way given our ability to continue to achieve strong levels of retention and increasing
returns approaching our targets. If we have an account where we've been successful at
increasing returns over time and that account has now reached an appropriate level of
profitability, it would be unwise of us to attempt to continue to increase rate significantly
on that account and risk the relationship with the agent and customer.
Consequently we just cautioned everyone from reacting to the decline in the headline
number as an indication that the environment generally has become meaningfully and
broadly more competitive.
At least for us, the environment has become more rate adequate and we are executing
account by account and class by class accordingly. So, now, after three plus years of
actions resulting in improved returns and profitability, the question is: where from here?
We've been reluctant to use the phrase soft landing because we believe that the phrase
is often mischaracterized to mean that somehow we have finished attempting to improve
the performance of our portfolio.
Nothing can be further from the truth. We remain concerned that the weather volatility
remains problematic, and we are not convinced that each of our catastrophe exposed
property accounts is priced to reflect that volatility. In addition, not every line or every class
of business is performing at the same level. For example we are not satisfied with the
returns on our commercial auto book, particularly in Select and we will continue to analyze
that portfolio and take the actions necessary to improve it.

FINAL

So we have more work to do. But there are lots of accounts that after years of successful
rate and underwriting actions are now at return levels that are consistent with our return
threshold and our expression of the soft landing relates to that portion of the book where
we have achieved so much. We don't see anything in the marketplace that suggests that
we are at a precipice or that the increased churning of accounts or significant across the
board rate declines are imminent.
Of course, we could be wrong about this. We know we operate in a fragmented
marketplace with lots of competition but we can only share with you our strategy. From
our view, it's more of the same and as we shared with you at Investor Day, we're going to
relentlessly leverage competitive advantages that should allow us to outselect and
outprice our competition. We expect to produce earnings and capital substantially in
excess of what we need to support our business and we will continue to return that
excess capital to shareholders. In short, nothing new and no shift. We feel very well
positioned to continue our mission of creating superior shareholder value and with that,
let me turn it over to Jay.

Jay S. Benet

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks, Jay. Let me start by saying that we were very pleased with our results this quarter,
particularly taking weather into account. Our investment results continue to be very solid,
driven by private equity returns, as were our underlying underwriting results. Within
underwriting, earned rate increases continue to exceed loss cost trends in each business
segments although the benefit to earnings and to our loss ratio was partially offset by
higher non-cat weather related losses this quarter versus the prior year quarter.
Underwriting also benefited from net favorable prior year reserve development of $183
million pre-tax, down slightly from the prior year quarter and was negatively impacted by
cat losses of $436 million pre tax, up $96 million from the prior year quarter.
We've provided two analyses in the webcast this quarter to help you better understand
the relationship of operating income to both the prior year quarter and to analyst
estimates. Jay already discussed the first analysis shown on page four of the webcast,
which provides insight as to why operating income decreased from the prior year quarter.
The second analysis shown on page five of the webcast provides insight as to why
operating income was less than the consensus estimate. The cat loss estimates contained
within the consensus estimate were significantly lower than our actual cat losses. We hope
this type of analysis is helpful to you.
Each of our business segments, once again, experienced net favorable prior year reserve
development. In BI, net favorable development of $25 million was driven by better than
expected loss experience and general liability excess coverages for accident years 2008
through 2012 resulting from a more favorable legal and judicial environment than we had
expected. This was partially offset by an $87 million increase to our environmental
reserves.

Net favorable reserve development of $146 million in FP&II primarily resulted from better
than expected results and contract surety within Bond and Financial Products, while in PI,
net favorable development of $12 million was primarily driven by better than expected
loss experience in Homeowners and Other for non-cat weather related losses in the 2013
accident year. Year-to-date on a combined stat basis for all of our U.S. subs only accident
year 2004 and prior developed unfavorably by a very modest amount, $73 million, due to
the strengthening of environmental reserves. All other accident years, 2005 through 2013
developed favorably.
We've included an overview of our cat reinsurance coverage on page 22 of the webcast
which has been structured in a way that is generally consistent with the prior year. Effective
July 1, we renewed our gen cat treaty, keeping both the attachment point and the dollar
amount of recovered losses the same as last year, recovered losses of up to $400 million
within the $1.5 billion to $2.25 billion layer. Also effective July 1, we renewed our Northeast
get cat treaty with the same $2.25 billion attachment point as last year but with an
increased dollar amount of recovered losses up to $850 million this year as compared to
$600 million last year.
Given the current reinsurance marketplace, both renewals were accomplished at lower
rates online and with improved terms and conditions, including amending the loss
occurrence definition so that all wind losses have a duration of 168 hours rather than 96
hours. A more complete description of our cat reinsurance coverage including a
description of our two Longpoint Re III cat bonds, our gen cat aggregate excessive loss
treaty that covers an accumulation of certain property losses arising from multiple
occurrences, our earthquake coverage and our international coverage is included in our
second quarter 10-Q which we filed earlier today as well as in our 10-K.
We continue to generate much more capital than is needed to support our businesses
allowing us to return $1.065 billion of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter. We
paid dividends of $190 million and repurchased $875 million of our common shares under
our publicly announced share repurchase program consistent with our ongoing capital
management strategy.
Operating cash flows remain strong at a little over $600 million and we ended the quarter
with over $1.8 billion of holding company liquidity. All of our capital ratios exceeded our
target levels and we ended the quarter with a debt to total capital ratio of 21.3%, well
within our target range.
Net unrealized investment gains rose to approximately $3.1 billion pre-tax or $2 billion after
tax up from $2 billion and $1.3 billion respectively at the beginning of the year due to lower
interest rates and book value per share of $75.32 was 13% higher than a year ago and
over 7% higher than at the beginning of the year. One final note, as you know, we're
revising our business segments and related disclosures to reflect the management
changes that were announced on June 10 and that became effective on July 1.
Accordingly, we report third quarter results using the new segment structure.

We are currently in the process of restating our 2013 Form 10-K, our second quarter 2014
Form 10-Q and our financial supplements for the periods contained therein to reflect the
new segment structure and we expect to make these restated documents available to
you in early September. So with that, let me turn things over to Brian.

Brian W. MacLean

{BIO 4679150 <GO>}

Thanks, Jay. In Business Insurance, second quarter operating income was $409 million and
the combined ratio was 99%. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact
of cats and prior year reserve development was 92.1% for the quarter, an improvement of
a full percentage point year-over-year and 90.1% for the first half of 2014, an
improvement of 2.5 points over the first half of 2013.
The point of improvement in the quarter was driven by about 2 points of earned rate in
excess of loss trend, partially offset by about 1 point of non-cat weather losses. So,
despite the significant impact of weather; solid profitability in the quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to production trends beginning on page 11, retention of 81% was strong and
slightly higher than recent periods. New business volume of $486 million was 8% higher
quarter over quarter while renewal premium change was down somewhat from recent
periods at about 6%.
The 6% included pure rate increases of about 4% which was about 1 point lower than last
quarter. As has been the case for the last 13 quarters, all major lines of business had
positive rate change, with the largest change this quarter coming in commercial auto. Not
surprisingly, auto was the line of business with the lowest return and accordingly, the
greatest rate need.
Loss trend for the segment continued to run at about 4%. So on an aggregate written
basis, rate gains approximated our current view of loss trend. We believe the production
results, both in the aggregate and by line of business are appropriate given our view of
product returns, but as Jay mentioned in his comments, we don't manage the business at
an aggregate or total line level. We execute account by account or class by class and this
is demonstrated on slide 15 which displays the distribution of renewal rate changes for
commercial accounts in the second quarter. As you can see from the slide, most accounts
received a single digit rate increase. But there were numerous accounts that got a rate
increase greater than 10% or got some level of rate decrease.
There are also some general trends in the portfolio. Recently, larger accounts have lower
average rate changes and has been the case for several quarters, commercial auto
accounts have higher average rate changes. And as always, individual account loss
experience matters. But the real take away from this slide is that the aggregate is simply
an average of thousands of individual account actions and accordingly success in this
business is not about achieving a higher aggregate rate number, it's about doing the right
things for the right account and generating an appropriate return over time.

FINAL

So in this context, our fundamental approach is unchanged and the results continue to be
encouraging. Simply put, we are retaining a very high percentage of our best performing
accounts at relatively modest rate increases. While on our poorer performing business,
we continue to get rate increases significantly above loss trend with lower retentions. We
are comfortable moving away from business where returns remain well below target
levels and as always, we actively look for new business opportunities with appropriate
returns.
We continue to be very comfortable with how our organization is executing at the granular
level and accordingly feel very good about the results. In the Financial, Professional and
International segment, we had record operating income of $254 million which was 65%
higher than the prior year quarter.
The increase was driven by higher levels of favorable prior year reserve development,
improved underlying underwriting margins, lower catastrophe losses and the inclusion of
The Dominion.

Bloomberg Transcript

The underlying combined ratio for the quarter was a very strong 89.2%, a slight
improvement from the prior year. The improvement was due to the 2014 exit from a
management liability excessive loss reinsurance treaty along with earned rate increases in
excess of loss cost trend across the segment, largely offset by the impact of The
Dominion.
Net written premium was up 38% in the quarter compared to the prior year due to the
inclusion of Dominion. In the management liability business within Bond and Financial
Products retention of 84% and new business of $37 million were both consistent with
recent periods and prior year, while renewal premium change of about 4% was down
somewhat from recent periods.
In international, retention remained strong at 80% while renewal premium change
improved to 3% and new business was up year-over-year due to the impact of Dominion.
So overall, a great quarter for the segment.
In our Personal Insurance business, operating income of $75 million for the quarter was
down 47% compared to the second quarter of 2013 driven by lower net favorable prior
year reserve development in Homeowners along with higher levels of catastrophe related
losses in both auto and home. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 89.8%,
a slight improvement over the second quarter of 2013 with lower underwriting expenses
and rate increases in excess of loss trends largely offset by higher non-cat weather
related losses.
Looking specifically at auto, on the production side, retention remains strong at 82%.
Renewal premium change was about 6%. While new business volume of $139 million was,
once again, up significantly versus recent periods due to the roll out of Quantum Auto 2.0.
We continue to be very pleased with the early results for Quantum Auto 2. The product is
now live in 31 states and those states represent about 85% of our countrywide auto new
business production. In the states where we've launched the product, we've seen quoted

FINAL

policies increase more than 10% while the number of policies issued has more than
doubled from pre-launch levels.
In addition, we continue to make progress on the expense initiatives announced a year
ago that are fundamental to our ability to make our auto product more price competitive.
To date, we've executed on initiatives responsible for about 75% of the $140 million run
rate savings target and we remain on track to achieve the full run rate saves by the end of
the year in line with our original expectations.
Turning to auto profitability, the underlying combined ratio of 96.2% for the quarter was a
slight improvement compared to the second quarter of 2013 with earned rate increases
more than offsetting loss trend and the impact of higher mix of new business versus
renewal business volumes.
Our current view of auto loss cost trend remains at about 4% with no significant change in
the underlying texture from previous quarters.

Bloomberg Transcript

Looking at Homeowners, production was strong in the quarter with renewal premium
change of about 8%. While retention remains at 84%. New business volume of $85 million
was up from the prior year quarter and recent periods due in part to account rounding on
our auto new business.
From a profitability perspective, the underlying combined ratio of 81.5% was in line with
the second quarter of 2013 with earned rate increases in excess of loss trend and lower
expenses offset by non-cat weather related losses. So overall, in Personal Insurance, we
saw strong profitability and an improving production picture. With that, let me turn it back
over to Gabby.

. And our first question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. Please proceed with your
question.

FINAL

Q - Brian R. Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yes, thanks. A couple of quick questions here for you. First of all, Jay, just curious if I look
at the Business Insurance and you kind of strip out the reserve releases and you kind of
normalized for cat losses, I kind of come up with about a 12% underlying return on equity
for the business. I guess my first question is, is that right? And is that about where you're
kind of targeting given the current interest rate environment?

A - Jay S. Fishman

{BIO 14011069 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I'll answer the second part of it. I'll let Jay Benet fuss with – as he does the math in his
head. We've been saying for some time that our stated target of achieving mid teens
return on equity over time was simply really not achievable in this interest rate
environment. But we were going to keep it as a statement, as an aspirational goal but
also because so much – so many of our systems and our culture are geared around it.
Having said that, we've chosen to avoid the notion of an artificial ceiling on what rate
adequacy or return adequacy is on an individual line or in an individual business. Some of
that is driven by competitive dynamics. What is the rest of the marketplace doing? Some
of it is based upon capacity. So it feels – I mean obviously at a 2.5% 10-year treasury a 12%
number feels pretty good but that doesn't mean that we're going to not take the actions
on an account by account or class by class basis that would continue to lift it if it's possible.
So that's really our honest assessment of it. It feels pretty good to us. But maybe there's
more. We're certainly going to try. But that, again, is a specific comment more than it is an
aggregate rate number. So important that we always keep that in mind. We price
individual accounts, we don't price the portfolio.

Q - Brian R. Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

But if you're pricing right now in line with trend, doesn't that kind of mean you're assuming
that returns are adequate?

A - Jay S. Fishman

{BIO 14011069 <GO>}

I'm sorry, Brian. Try me again

Q - Brian R. Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

You said you're pricing your Business Insurance in line with loss trend, right?

A - Jay S. Fishman

{BIO 14011069 <GO>}

No, no, no. What Brian said was that our best accounts are getting modest loss trend. I
believe, I'm trying to go back to his comments.
Page 9 of 25



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The

Q - Brian R. Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yeah.

FINAL

A - Jay S. Fishman

{BIO 14011069 <GO>}

And that our poor performing accounts, whatever that means in that framework after
three years of rate increases but they're always poor performing accounts. That the poor
performing accounts are getting significantly more rate increase at lower retention.

A - Brian W. MacLean

{BIO 4679150 <GO>}

So another way to say that, Brian, is this quarter the way the arithmetic worked out is rate
that we got on the entire portfolio approximated the aggregate loss trend but that could
be very different and we could be thrilled with the result or unhappy with the result, either
direction depending on how we get there.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jay S. Fishman

{BIO 14011069 <GO>}

And I think the other part of that that really is important is that we wouldn't contemplate
that we can improve our profitability by getting meaningful rate increase on our best
performing business. Our focus there is to do our best to offset trend and to maximize
retention. Our improvement and profitability is going to come from identifying those
segments that underperform and continuing to make real progress there. I recall in the
last quarter, we actually put up a slide which showed the rate gain in our fifth segment in
commercial accounts, I think. I can't remember if it was commercial or middle market, but
compared the number of accounts and the rate gain to the previous year's quarter and
the rate gain in that fifth bucket was 21%, I think, last year and 20% this year was the rate
gain. That's where the improvement and profitability is going to come from. Not just from
that fifth class but that's the example here. It's going to be identifying those segments
that continue to underperform and continuing to drive them.

Q - Brian R. Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great. Thanks.

A - Jay S. Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

The other thing I would add before I'll address your first question is that we had this
internal discussion about margin improvement and you have to look at it in terms what
you're talking about. Are you talking about combined ratio or are you talking about
dollars?
And when you talk about combined ratio, if you do the arithmetic, if you're covering loss
trend – let's just make up some numbers, let's say you have a 60% loss ratio. Obviously
premiums worth 100%, if you're covering loss trend that's 4% with rate increases, you're
multiplying the denominator and the numerator by the same number and you come up
with the same combined ratio at the end of it. 60% – I'm sorry, loss ratio, 60% in this case.
What you lose track of in that are the dollars because you're applying a 4% increase to
100% and another 4% increase 60% of that. So you're actually increasing the dollars of
margin and increasing profitability therefore even when you're covering loss trends. So I
Page 10 of 25



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2014-07-22

FINAL

just say that for all of you to keep in mind that you got to look at it as to what question are
you really asking, is combined ratio changing or are dollars of margin changing?
Getting back to the first question about the overall returns, we do an analysis of our
quarters, our year to dates, and if I look at the year to date operating return on equity,
which was 14.6%. There is prior year development in there. Prior year development to us
counts, because a lot of it relates to recent periods where we've seen trends different
than what we had expected and they've been favorable. So, in any given period you can
adjust for it, but if you look at the 14.6% and back out the amount of PYD and divide by
average equity, you'll come up with something that looks like a proxy for an accident year,
this year. So that's a way of looking at it, but as Jay said, we look at these returns over
time and we try to manage as close as we can to that mid teens goal.

Operator
Our next question comes from Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed with
your question.

Q - Paul Newsome

{BIO 1541286 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning. I was hoping you could maybe revisit the topical issue of the connections
between the reinsurance market and the primary market, particularly in the large account
bases, just given the fact that we've seen a lot of rate decline out of reinsurance. And
how should we think about that affecting your businesses as the competitive environment
changes there quite a bit?

A - Jay S. Fishman

{BIO 14011069 <GO>}

Paul this is Jay Fishman. We think we'll all pitch in a little on that. First, I just observed that
broadly speaking, we are really not a large account writer I suspect in the context of the
question that you're asking. We are a small commercial and middle market account
company. We do large accounts on a fee-for-service basis that are largely independent of
the reinsurance decision. And we obviously do some national property business, we
certainly do that for large accounts.
Anecdotally, although some evidence to this, I think, exists, the layered national property
business and my recollection, again we did this last quarter. I think it's less than 5% of our
premium business overall but the layered large account property business is a much more
price sensitive, price driven marketplace. More challenging than it was before. Now there
are returns in that segment that are awfully attractive and so you've got to balance out
the notion of competitive dynamics within the overall returns, but nonetheless, we think
you're seeing some of the changes in the new capital formation.
Whether it's reinsurance, by the way, or excess and surplus, bumping into that layered
national property account business. And I would say on the primary side for us that's
probably where the impact is most significant. I'm trying to see if anybody else here has a
different view. We're really not, I mean our treaty reinsurance is, for a company of our size,
relatively modest and so we've got either savings opportunities, they're nice, but they're
not going to move the needle very much. Or we can change the way in which we
Page 11 of 25

Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2014-07-22

FINAL

purchase. We can buy more for the same dollars or less for even fewer dollars, but on the
margin, it doesn't change anything.
I've been asked a few times whether in this is an opportunity for us and I suspect that
what people are thinking is, does the calculus behind primary exposure change? Would
you be willing to do either different classes of business or more business particularly in
catastrophe exposed areas and rely more on reinsurance to produce a net acceptable
return.
So far the answer for us is no – that we worry a lot about the mismatch of business. We
worry a lot about relying on reinsurance as a strategic solution rather than as a risk
balancing factor, if you like. And the notion of expanding our liability base and relying on
reinsurance contract to bail us out, where we're not quite sure if that refinance capacity
really sticks, is it permanent, it is really there for the long haul, it's just not clear to us yet.
So, for us, the answer is that the impact of all of this is not yet very much. It's – we spend
not an insignificant amount of time talking about it and thinking about ways in which it
could impact us. But so far, I think you're hard pressed other than in that layered national
property business to find an area where it's really having an impact. I don't know, Brian, do

for us to look at that would also illustrate...?

A - Jay S. Fishman

{BIO 14011069 <GO>}

That's actually a great question, and I think you asked it actually in exactly the right way. It's
not that the number doesn't have arithmetic meaning. We acknowledge it does. But the
tendency to perceive it as a competitive indicator, we just don't see that. We've always
said and have for many years that retention is going to be the leading indicator of a
changing competitive environment. And I'll go back to the last really difficult pricing

environment that we had which was back into the 1990s. You'll see retention rates in
middle market dropped down into the high 60%s, and that really defined what was going
on. There was tremendous churn in the marketplace.
It didn't happen overnight, but retention rates declined and that followed – that led, if you
will, the overall rate dynamic. Now we haven't seen that yet. We haven't seen it on the
way up, we haven't seen it – we're still on the way up although we're at slower rates. We
just haven't seen a drop in retention and we've said for a long time that we think that
that's the principal indicator. Now we also, to provide whatever anecdotal observation we
can, we often have provided you with commentary about what we're hearing from the
field. And you have to take that with a bit of a grain of salt because it doesn't mean it's
right. But they are observations from people in the field, dealing with individual accounts
every day. And our comments remain that there's nothing that we're hearing from our
folks that would cause us to think that we're at a precipice or broadly a more meaningfully
competitive environment. But I watch retention and that's what I look at and when I see a
drop in that, that's when it's time to begin to understand what's going on in that local
environment.

Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my call. My question is regarding to the
segmentation changes and management change recently. Could you comment a little bit
more on that?

A - Jay S. Fishman

{BIO 14011069 <GO>}

I don't know that we have much more to say. We put out a press release. It's part of
management's responsibility. Our responsibility here is to make sure that the younger
talent in the organization gets additional exposure, exposure internally, exposure
externally and position the company for continuity and just felt to us like a very ordinary
and appropriate thing to do. The realignment was, to a great extent, driven by reporting
relationships within those changes. So much more about people than about any particular
realignment about the business.

Q - Kai Pan

A - Jay S. Fishman

Well, I would never speak for the board. And so we think we have a responsibility to
develop talent and present to the board as solid a management team as we're capable
of doing. And we're going to be a management team that is going to step up to that
responsibility and not side step it. The depth of the folks in this place around here never

make sure that those people get additional responsibility and additional exposure. And
that when that time comes that it's very natural, there's nothing upsetting to the

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

That was good to know. Just two quick follow-up questions. The first is – I guess it was
Brian's question, and you answered that. Jay, you said retentions – you haven't seen it on
its way up. And I'm trying to sort of think about this – and you're right; we should focus on
retentions and rate adequacy. If so many lines are at rate adequacy, shouldn't that
eventually start translating into better retentions and eventual growth in premiums?

A - Jay S. Fishman

{BIO 14011069 <GO>}

Well, complicated question. I think that retention – something Chuck Clarke taught me
many years ago, that the real emotional content behind retention is agent comfortable,
market comfortable, customer comfortable. A terrific set of circumstances where
everybody feels good and fair and equitable in the relationship and that will encourage
accounts to stay where they are and that's a really good thing. It's good for the accounts
by the way. We think tenure matters. We think it's an advantage, it's good for the agents.
They can attend to things that they need to attend to and obviously it's good for the
carriers that have the business.
So the retention dynamic is, I think, really a reflection of the level of comfort of all of the
parties to the transaction and that's really good. That's a good thing. The dynamic of
growth is a more challenging one. There's no green light that goes on that says, aha, now
we're interested in growing. We're always interested in doing more business, always. And
when we can bring on new accounts, and we have demonstrated this in slides in years

gone by. Recognizing that there is a – the internal expression is a new business penalty,
but recognizing that there's a new business penalty associated with it if we can see a
pathway to bringing on new accounts and over time managing them to acceptable
returns, we're going to go ahead and do that. There's nothing different about that this
month than there was last month. And it's not as if we weren't booking new business a
year ago when rates weren't as attractive as they are now. We were as aggressive as we
could be and if anything, I would say that if we had any disappointment is that we weren't
actually doing more notwithstanding our encouragement. The thing to recognize is that
and again I've said this before. I apologize for saying that so many times. I don't want to
sound as though we believe this because it's this quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

This is what we said. You're not going to grow your book by marginally changing your
price attitude add the point of sale. First of all, we don't have a price list. We don't have a
price list. It's an individual underwriter sitting down with an agent talking about an individual
account. So it's not as if we can say lower prices by 3% or 4%. It just isn't that precise. And
so the way you grow is bier and perceiving opportunity typically by risk selection. Either
categories of risk, lines of business, geographies that you weren't in before that now for
any number of reasons you perceive opportunity for us – Canada, terrific opportunity.
Brazil, a terrific opportunity.
We showed at Investor Day we've grown our middle markets business and my
recollection is like by 50% over eight or nine years from $2.1 billion to $3.2 billion in
premiums. Now at the same time, our construction surety business has shrunk dramatically
as a result of the environment we're in. And so you have to be – we're not one market,
we're 50 markets, and you have to be nimble enough to see the opportunities where
they are and pursue them aggressively, but also be cautious enough to understand the
risk presented in a changing set of circumstances and dial it back.
So we've been growing in lines of business here significantly and either because
circumstances change or we made mistakes in some markets and we did, we've shrunk
others. So it's all net, but it is in that granular dynamic.

Q - Amit Kumar

Thank you. I had a question about Dominion, actually. If I remember right, that was a

you've really turned that around very quickly. Just curious kind of where is that business

order to kind of get yourself to that place. Thanks.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Sure, Michael. It's Alan Schnitzer, I'll handle that. I guess I would say – I would caution you
from thinking that we've turned it around that quickly. There's certainly a lot of integration
work going on and we're still hard at work on that. So the improvement you're seeing, my
guess is you're looking at the results and seeing the combined ratio relative to what we
guided you to and attributing that to Dominion. That's actually not correct. It's mostly a
reinsurance transaction and some large losses that were better than what we had in the
92%. So it's actually not coming from The Dominion.

Q - Michael S. Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I see.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

But to get to your question, what are we doing. We're doing all the sorts of things you
think that a company like us would be doing. We're working hard with Greg Toczydlowski
in Personal Insurance and the whole Business Insurance team to bring all the knowhow and
sophistication and data and analytics. Some scale and synergy advantage, but really just
taking the knowhow we have resident here at Travelers and exporting it to that platform.
And we feel very good about the opportunity as good as we did when we signed up the
deal. But I can't tell you that it's all been reflected in this quarter.

Q - Michael S. Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

I see. So the expense ratio benefit that we saw is primarily a result of the reinsurance
transaction you mentioned, then?

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

No, no. The expense benefit you saw does primarily come from The Dominion but there
is a more than offsetting loss ratio deterioration from The Dominion. So, on a net basis –
well on an-in basis, loss and expense ratio that Dominion is actually hurting. But it is
helping on the expense ratio pretty significantly. And it's a loss ratio piece we think that
over time we'll be able to work through and bring to hurdle levels. Does that make sense?

Q - Jay H. Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Thanks very much. For those who have been covering the company and the industry for a
long time, I think we all understand that spring storms tends to be a heavy seasonal cat
quarter. I think it would be helpful for folks to get a perspective on what you would view a
normalized annual cat load to be. If I look back over, say, the past dozen years, I think the
average is between 4 and 5 combined ratio points. Is that a good starting point?

A - Brian W. MacLean

{BIO 4679150 <GO>}

And Jay, just for clarification, you're talking about in the second quarter?

Q - Jay H. Gelb

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. We've got something in the proxy.

A - Jay S. Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

This is Jay Benet, Jay. Actually, if you go to the proxy, there's a discussion about results.
And in it we do talk about what the expectation was for cats in the year versus where we
ended up. And my recollection is, the number is about $550 million after tax dollars – in
dollars, yes. So we're just having somebody open up the proxy and make sure we're right
about that.

Q - Jay H. Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. I can certainly take a look at that. And the next issue would be in terms
of capital return. I'm wondering if we were to think about out years, could Travelers
ultimately be in a position where dividends plus share buybacks could exceed annual
operating earnings?

A - Jay S. Fishman

{BIO 14011069 <GO>}

Not permanently. It can obviously year-to-year and that's really a function of timing, but
the only way that it could actually exceed earnings permanently would be if we liquidated
the company. That's the only way to do it. So, not permanently. No.

Jay, let me just jump back, this is Brian MacLean. You started with we all kind of know
spring storms and volatility and clearly, we do. But when we look at our data of particularly
what happened with spring weather over the course of the last – well really since 2008,
it's dramatically higher than what you would have seen in the previous 20 years. To the
extent of a 3X kind of number and in fact – and that's not even counting the 2011 off the
charts number that we had. So we've always known that we would have near term, short
term volatility in our cat numbers and everybody who follows the industry is used to
looking at that, but particularly for the second quarter tornado/hail activity and how our
product is used to deal with that, we really have done a lot of thinking about what's the
long term move to and whether we see continuing volatility in that number. So that's...

A - Jay S. Fishman

{BIO 14011069 <GO>}

A good example anecdotally actually of the magnitude of the volatility. It was not too long
ago, we didn't think about catastrophe load in auto – in personal auto. We do now and
that's just a function of experience. So we're reacting to the changing weather patterns
kind of almost on a real time basis. It's hard to answer the question at this point of what a
normal level is. That's why we've talked about it so much over the last few years as being
a driver of not only rate but underwriting and terms and conditions. It's just proving to be a
challenge.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. First question on the competitive environment. I think you've done a
good job explaining that it's largely unchanged. Jay, you mentioned that you think that
there is likely going to be a soft landing. Just curious, sort of looking at this cycle versus
past, what's different? And what gives you greater confidence that there is going to be a
softer landing this time around?

A - Jay S. Fishman

{BIO 14011069 <GO>}

Vinay, and obviously just because it's my opinion doesn't mean it's so. I need to start off
with that. It's just one person's point of view. We've been talking for years now about the
fact that our view was that the magnitude of the cyclicality in our business we thought
would be lower than historical experience and it was driven by everything from much
better data across the industry. I'll exclude myself but I think much better management in
the industry than was in the case 20 years ago.
You look at capital deployment philosophies it's different than it was 20 years ago. I think
Sarbanes Oxley and the attention of audit committees and boards to adequacy of
reserves, to the level – the procedures and policies around reserve setting has made
Page 18 of 25



FINAL

Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The

them much more accurate. It's not that people were abusing it before, it's that there is a
whole different level of attention and focus on those initial picks, what's driving them,
what are the factors, the transparency that exists throughout the governance committee,
external auditors, internal auditors, boards, those are all things that will make the
accounting and reserving process better. Never a guarantee. We're all talking about the
future. But it will make it better and I think it has. And I think as a consequence of that, the
feedback loop between claim performance and underwriters and pricing decisions is
stunningly faster than it was 20 years ago.
We actually are at the point now where we're booking weather dynamics virtually month
to month. When I first started here, you were lucky if you had it in the quarter. That's the
level of feedback that there was. So the delay in understanding loss trend, factoring it
back into reserving and changing pricing was much more attenuated than it is today. It's
crisp. And I listen to other companies and how they report. I don't think we're unique in
that regard.

Bloomberg Transcript

I think – I listen to other companies and I'm impressed by what I hear and the nature of
controls and procedures and the thoughtfulness and I think as a consequence, the
magnitude of – there'll always be some cyclicality here. There's a cyclicality in every
business. But I said now coming close to probably eight or nine years ago, I thought the
amplitude on the way up as well as the amplitude on the way down were going to be
much more narrow.
I think that was true obviously on the way up. We'll now see how good I am on the way
down. So that's what I think and we'll find out. I think the leadership in this industry has
come to understand that attempting to grow market share by marginally changing price
and actually creating shareholder value from it is impossible. I think about it all the time
and I don't know how to do it and I'm not sure anybody else does. And so we've all
learned within our own cultures and our own environment and our own strategies how to
manage our businesses to create shareholder value. That's what we're supposed to do.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Sure. That's helpful. Thank you. Just as a quick follow-up on the Quantum 2.0, I think you
said that the results were in line with expectations. Just a little bit more color on that.
You've had six months in. So what are you seeing in terms of loss trend versus your
expectations? Thanks.

A - Jay S. Fishman

{BIO 14011069 <GO>}

I'm going to turn it over to Greg in a second to talk about loss trend. But it'd be remiss if I
didn't observe because I think he takes it for granted on this. We mentioned that the
number of quoted policies is actually up 10%. That's one of the really wonderful surprises
here. We thought going into this that we were being quoted everywhere because of the
comparative rating process. And it was not our going in expectation that by putting in a
different model that we would actually increase the number of quotes and so what's been
– that 10% is a big number and what's impressive about that is the agent understanding
and reaction of The Travelers' product of Quantum 2 as a legitimate competitive product
and they're embracing it in their quoting process. So Greg will talk about loss trend. But
Page 19 of 25



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The

we've to some extent taken for granted internally the increase in quotes. But it's a
substantive plus.

FINAL

A - Gregory C. Toczydlowski

{BIO 16615940 <GO>}

Absolutely. And I think that echoes how we feel about loss performance. We're very
encouraged when we saw that increase in quote flow that Jay talked about. Obviously our
focus then shifts right to the margin how we're felling about the profitability of that
business, given that we just launched our three largest states last month, we're not up on
a one year anniversary, obviously we don't have a credible set of earned premium yet to
really declare victory. But our focus is really looking at long term surrogates of profit. Right
now, including the mix of business, short tail coverages like the frequency and physical
damage coverages and all of those things that we're looking at, they're right within
expectation. So we'll continue to aggressively measure the ultimate combined ratio. But
all those proxies that we look at are within expectation. So we're feeling as good about
the quote flow that Jay talked about that we are with the early loss indicators.

A - Gabriella Nawi

{BIO 2211991 <GO>}

Before we go to the next question, Jay Benet has a correction.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jay S. Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

It's a comment more than a correction. We said we would give you the number from the
proxy as it relates to the quote-unquote, normal cat losses. And what we're remembering
was actually from two years ago. The proxy from 2013 had $645 million as the after tax
cost associated with cat. So we had $550 million before and as I'm reflecting on that, the
thing I'd want to share with you is really the fragility of these kinds of estimates because
looking at the $550 million going to $650 million, it's not a reflection of increased
exposure. It's really a reflection of trying to refine year-over-year what these cat estimates
are and it's not all that long ago that, if you asked the same question, we would have said
something like $350 million after tax and thinking back to those times, I would say our
exposure base was actually quite a lot larger than that. So this notion of normal...

Hi. Thank you. I have a couple on reserves; it's in the commercial area. You commented
that better legal environment led to kind of 2008 to 2012 releases. Can we infer, just kind
of from a normal claim-closing pattern on general liability that anything you'd get 2008
and prior in that area is kind of – you would have seen it by now?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jay S. Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

This is Jay Benet. I mean, when we're dealing with reserves by definition we're dealing
with incomplete information. So we're looking at new information that's coming in every
quarter and evaluating that with regard to whatever the assumptions have been. So I
wouldn't look at any one of our reserves as being at finality. We're always looking at the
flow of information and adjusting. There are times when you see something, you're not
sure whether you're going to react in full or in part to it. So I think that's the best I can do
to answer your question.

Q - Randy Binner

{BIO 15145081 <GO>}

Okay. I mean I'm just trying to get a sense of – because there is some tail in GL, but it's
not as long as, like, asbestos environmental. So I'm just trying to get a sense of if there
really even is the potential for a lot more to come from 2008 and prior?

A - Jay S. Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

I mean, our reserves are always at best estimate. We don't really comment on whether
they're going to change. We'll see what the data says going forward. But there's always
new information coming out.

A - Jay S. Fishman

{BIO 14011069 <GO>}

I'd just make an observation. Asbestos and environmental is a general liability exposure.
The difference there is that particularly in the asbestos arena, much of it came from the
Page 21 of 25



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The

time when there were no policy aggregates – where there were per-occurrence, at least
on a committed basis. I think we ended up with policy aggregate starting in the early
1980s. So that was – that pre-dated that. But liability is a policy that lasts forever. You can
always have things pop, you just never know.

Thank you. I guess the question I had was on loss trend. You talk about a loss trend in
Business Insurance of roughly around 4%. And I'm wondering: is that the number you price
for, or is that what you are observing? Because seemingly, what you've been pricing for,
for the past five years, you've seen something less than that given the reserve releases.
So when you talk about that number, what exactly are you referring to?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jay S. Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

Our actuaries, our finance folks, our business folks are always looking at what they think
frequency and severity is going to be and building in various assumptions. They take into
account what recent trends have been. There's always the question of, gee, if you've
seen – I will make up an example, if you have seen recent inflation running at 1% or
whatever, what does that mean going forward? Is it going to continue at 1% or is it going
to get better, is it going to get worse. So at a very granular level, we're making
assumptions every day in pricing and reserving as to what the future has in store based
on current events and past trends.
And when you look at the kind of environment that we're faced with today, looking at very
tame inflation but some of the factors at work as to creating uncertainty as to what those
inflation rates are going to be going forward, you have to take that into account and
ultimately that along with every other assumption comes down to a series of numbers for
frequency and severity. And things have been running pretty moderately, but when we say
there is a 4% trend factor and if you go back in time, I think you're absolutely right in
saying well maybe it was actually a little less severe than we had expected. So we had
favorable development. But going forward you have to make a determination as to
whether that's going to continue or whether the world is going to change.

Right so specifically, Jay, when we say this quarter 4% loss trend, we're talking about both
what we're seeing as trend in the current year and what we're pricing for and obviously,
that's an aggregate number so it's all over the place by different lines. As we have prior
year development, we're looking at why we had that development and does that change
our outlook of what the current year should be. So an example of one which usually

wouldn't would be if we had favorable development on prior year cats, we'd probably say
that doesn't unless they were dramatic, wouldn't fundamentally change our view of cats
this year. There are other things that you could obviously say would change it. So for the
base year it does move, but it's...

A - Jay S. Fishman

{BIO 14011069 <GO>}

Yeah, and the most volatile part of it is non-cat weather. Our loss trend numbers make an
assumption about non-cat weather and that's obviously at least I think the most
unpredictable part of that loss trend dynamic. And it's one of the reasons why you're
hearing us relentlessly talk about offset by favorable and non-cat weather or offset by
adverse non-cat weather. It's just – who knows.

Q - Jay A. Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Yeah, and on that topic, you had talked about non-cat whether relative to a year ago
being worse. Can you speak to non-cat weather relative to a normal second quarter? Was
this worse than you might have expected normally, instead of just compared to last year
versus a normal expectation?

A - Brian W. MacLean

{BIO 4679150 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So, I'll take that and it's a little different BI to PI. So in Personal Insurance, we would say this
quarter the non-cat weather was about normal. It was a couple points worse than last
year, which was abnormally low.
In BI, this quarter non-cat weather was a little bit high. So about 1 point unfavorable to both
last year which was kind of normal and what we would have expected this year. And the
difference there is especially when you get into tornado/hail, the impacts in the
commercial business can be really random and volatile. Personal lines, you have a storm
and it hits the neighborhood and we can kind of see the claims. In Business Insurance, you
can hit our risk or not hit our risk and it could dramatically change the numbers. So that's a
perspective relative to kind of normal. PI about normal this quarter, BI a little bit worse
than normal.

Great. And this will be our last and final question.

And our last question comes from Josh Stirling with Bernstein. Please proceed with your
question.

Q - Josh Clayton Stirling

{BIO 17463087 <GO>}

You guys are kind for fitting me in. So we talked a lot about reserves. I was wondering if
you could give us some color. I know it's a best estimate, but there's a range of different
approaches across the industry. Some companies consistently target something like zero
favorable development target; some consistently target a much larger number. You guys,

just from observation, seem to be sort of in the middle of the range. But as everybody is
thinking about earnings over the next few years, pricing is slowing; you know, I think you're
guiding – in your outlook section, you talk about how underwriting margins on the
underlying basis seem to be slowing and stabilizing. I'm wondering what we should be
expecting. You guys truly would like to be sort of a normal level of favorable
development, when you think about sort of what's your real philosophy, really, and
through the cycle ought to look like would be really helpful for us.

A - Jay S. Fishman

{BIO 14011069 <GO>}

Looking at each other, Jay and I are. My own view is that our goal is to get it right. If we
could pick the right number and first of all, that's our responsibility. Our obligation is to
record best estimates and that's what we do. We attempt to record best estimate. And
the accounting rules are critical, they're a really big deal. But it's also how you price and
how you think about the returns in your business and where you perceive risk versus
reward. So the importance of making it our best estimate is just critical. And we'd struggle
to figure out how to manage the business if we were recording something other than that
because we price to that loss ratio, we price to that trend. We price to that yield curve, it's
just critical for us.
So I'm sure Jay and I would say this, but I look at him – would give you the same answer
which is our expectation sitting here today is that – there won't be any development. We
think we've got it right. It doesn't mean that we don't have issues that we're watching and
aware of that you all ask us often about emerging trends in claims and where we keep
track of all that. But our goal is to get it right. And so the notion of a question about a
normal level of reserve development just doesn't resonate with us. We don't think of it
that way. We don't think there say normal level of reserve development.

A - Jay S. Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

And I fully agree with that. It's always about a best estimate, it's always about getting it
right. And I just echo what Jay says.

Q - Josh Clayton Stirling

{BIO 17463087 <GO>}

That's fine. Thank you. Again, I guess I just asked the question and if this quarter seemed
to slow a little bit, the composition was – I think you talked about there are some good
guys and bad guys. FP&II was obviously good news, and then there was some
environmental. Is there anything we can infer from sort of the lower BI favorable
development and the lower personal lines favorable development that we should look at
as sort of a forward-leading indicator? Or is the process still the same? And should we just
sort of look back over the average and make our own conclusions?

A - Jay S. Benet

{BIO 2456473 <GO>}

We try to give you as much information as we can with regard to what the drivers of
favorable development are. So in the case of PI, you think about the first quarter, a lot of it
dealt with weather related losses both cat and non-cat and we had some additional noncat weather related losses that turned out to be more favorable. In Business Insurance
you just mentioned the level of favorable development was 25. But that was after the

environmental. So, I think if you just look at the numbers, you've got a story line that over
the last many years has provided insight as to what are the drivers of it and we'll see just
how those drivers or others manifest themselves moving forward. But I don't think there's
more that we have to offer as it relates to that. We try to be pretty transparent – very
transparent on it.

A - Gabriella Nawi

{BIO 2211991 <GO>}

Very good. That will conclude our call for today. Thank you very much for joining us and as
always, Andrew Hersom and I in Investor Relations will be available for any follow up
questions. Thank you.
