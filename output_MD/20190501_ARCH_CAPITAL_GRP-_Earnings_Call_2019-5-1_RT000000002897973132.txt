I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference Mr.Marc Grandisson and
Mr.Francois Morin. Sir's, you may begin.

Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Thank you, Crystal, and good morning to you all. We have had a good start to the year as
Arch grew book value per share by 7.4% to $23.12 at March 31 and generated operating
earnings of $0.67 per share due to strong underwriting and investment results in the first
quarter of 2019. As mentioned on our call last quarter, we continue to see modest upward
rate movement in property and select casualty lines, along with reductions in ceding
commissions paid by our reinsurance units. Our mortgage insurance or MI group,
continues to operate in a market characterized by historically strong credit conditions and
conservative lending standards. For Arch, this is an underwriting market where selection
and segmentation remain key to generating favorable results. It is not a one size fits all
market by any means.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the one hand, we believe that the modest improvement in the property and casualty
markets reflect broader economic growth particularly in the United States, while on the
other hand we see inconsistent evidence of increased discipline by underwriters. We can
sum up our view of current market conditions with two key virtues that describes how we
operate at Arch prudence and patience.
Prudence has been a good advisor to us. In our P&C segments, rate changes in the
quarter for our Insurance Group has been positive, but ranging in any one line from minus
5% to plus 8% averaging about plus 2.3%. Considering that insurance loss trend, our claim
inflation typically runs about 200 bps above the CPI, we remain prudent in setting our loss
picks and allocating additional capital in any single line given the uncertainty of future loss
costs.
Prudence in our reserving process dictates that we maintain an appropriate margin for
error because reserving errors can lead to pricing errors. We saw modest growth in the
first quarter of 2019 in our Insurance Group as net written premium increased 8% due in
part to the UK acquisition we mentioned last quarter.
The balance of the growth was from a combination of rate and new opportunities in short
and medium tail lines. In typical Arch fashion, we remain focused on risk-adjusted returns
and patience means that we seek evidence of acceptable margin improvement even as
the market experiences some pullback in capacity such as in the larger commoditized
lines and also within some E&S markets that you have heard about on other calls. Within
our Reinsurance Group, property cat exposed rate are moving up after absorbing severe
industry wide catastrophe losses these past two years. These losses have caused some
dislocation in capacity across the industry and have paved the way for new opportunities
which our underwriting teams were able to participate in. However, we remain focused on
the absolute level of risk adjusted rates and selective in our approach to cat exposed
business.

FINAL

Now, turning to our MI segment. Overall the underwriting environment remains very
attractive. Growth in our insurance in force is producing increases in earned premium and
contributing to a future stream of earnings, that is strong and predictable . In MI, the key
underwriting characteristics that drive earnings are credit quality and the economy, with
which more than pricing drive ultimate performance. Therefore, even as pricing has
become more competitive credit quality remains excellent and key macroeconomic
factors are very good, which has resulted in very strong risk-adjusted returns.
As you may know, in MI from an accounting standpoint, these returns will be reflected in
earnings, over several years. For the first quarter of 2019, our U.S. MI new insurance
written or NIW, was $11.2 billion down about 2% from the same quarter a year ago. While
NIW, reflects business written in the quarter, the more relevant indicator of insurance
earnings is insurance in force, which Arch MI U.S. grew to $277 billion at the end of March
of 2019. As with all our business units, in MI, we are focused on returns rather than market
share and we intend to remain disciplined and agile. We believe that our long experience
with RateStar and our insurance linked notes known as Bellemeade Securities provide
Arch a competitive advantage with respect to risk management, our interface with
lenders and our upfront risk selection.

Bloomberg Transcript

As I alluded to earlier, our key risk parameters are at very healthy level levels. Credit
quality as indicated by FICO scores remain strong across our enforced book with a
weighted average score of 743. Our combined ratio in our MI segment remains
exceptional 25.6% in the first quarter, which is substantially better, than the long-term
industry average of the mid to high '40s.
With respect to our investment operations, higher yields available in the financial markets
produced excellent results on both a yield and total return basis. Turning briefly now to
risk management. For the past few years, and continuing into 2019, our property cat
exposures remain at historically low levels with a 1-in-250 year peak zone at about 4% of
tangible common equity at April 1.
In our MI segment, our issuance of Bellemeade Securities continued the pace with our
second issue this year that closed yesterday and provides $620 million of reinsurance
indemnity on more than $35 billion of insurance in force. We have issued $3.5 billion of
Bellemeade Securities over the past four years which remains an important part of our risk
management capabilities.
As of today, Bellemeade Securities provide protection on more than 90% of our existing
insurance in force. With regards to PMIERs as of March 31 2019, Arch MI's U.S. sufficiency
ratio was 146% of the GSE capital requirements known as the PMIERs as I mentioned. With
that in mind and with that, I will turn it over to Francois, Morin to provide you more
specifics on our quarterly results. Francois?

Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

Thank you, Marc, and good morning to all. Before I give you some comments on
observations on our results for the first quarter, I wanted to remind you that consistent

FINAL

with prior practice, these comments are on a core basis which corresponds to Arch's
financial results excluding the other segment.i.e., the operations of Watford Holdings Ltd.
In our filings the term consolidated includes Watford.
As you know, Watford's common shares began trading on the NASDAQ global select
market, on March 28, 2019. While this event now provides a market price on the value of
our ownership in Watford, it does not impact the presentation of our financial statements
or any of our disclosures which have remained unchanged since Watford's formation in
2014. After-tax operating income for the quarter was $275.9 million which translates to an
annualized 12.3% operating return on average common equity and $0.67 per share. Book
value per share was $23.12, at March 31st, a 7.4% increase from last quarter and a 13.3%
increase from one year ago. This result, reflects the effect of strong contributions from
both our underwriting operations and our investment portfolio.

Moving on to underwriting results. Losses from 2019 catastrophic events in the first
quarter net the reinsurance recoverables and reinstatement premiums stood at $7.9
million or 0.6 combined ratio points. These losses, were nearly all observed in the results
of our reinsurance segment, which were impacted by a handful of minor events across
the globe. As for prior period, net loss reserve development, we recognized
approximately $36.7 million of favorable development in the first quarter net of related
adjustments or 3.0 combined ratio points, compared to 4.6 combined ratio points in the
first quarter of 2018. Both the insurance and the mortgage segments experienced
favorable development at $1.7 million and $36.6 million respectively.
The reinsurance segment experienced the minor amount of approximately $1.6 million of
adverse development including 16 million related to Typhoon Jebi. The increase for this
event reflects updated loss information received from scenes [ph] and additional industry
data. The mortgage segment benefited from significant favorable development in our
first lien portfolio or cure rates observed in recent quarters continued to be materially
better than long-term averages and expectations. The insurance segments accident
quarter combined ratio excluding cats was 100.2%, 150 basis points higher, than for the
same period one year ago. The year-over-year comparison for the insurance segment is
affected by two notable items.
First, as we mentioned on our previous call, our operating expense ratio was impacted by
the shift in the timing of share based compensation from the second quarter to the first
quarter. This shift increased, the first quarter expense ratio for this segment by
approximately 94 basis points relative to one year ago. Second, we continue to invest in
our insurance operations, including the integration of recent acquisitions in the U.S. and
the U.K. The most notable impact to our expense ratio this quarter relates to our U.K.
regional book, whose operating expenses added 110 basis points to our overall expense
ratio for this segment.
As mentioned in the earnings release, we did not acquire an unearned premium portfolio
with this acquisition and as a result the expense ratio will remain higher than the long-term
run rate until the associated earned premium reaches a steady state. Overall, the
underlying performance of our insurance segment showed improvements in the quarter
mostly due to lower levels of attritional losses and acquisition expenses. The reinsurance

FINAL

segment accident quarter combined ratio excluding cat stood at 92.4% compared to
93.4% on the same basis one year ago.
As we mentioned on prior calls we tend to look at trailing 12 month analysis in order to
assess the ongoing performance of our segments given the inherent volatility in the
business that can emerge from quarter-to-quarter. The year-over-year comparison for the
reinsurance segment is affected by the presence of a $10.2 million premium retroactive
reinsurance transaction, we entered into this quarter, which contains sufficient risk transfer
for insurance accounting treatment under GAAP.

Bloomberg Transcript

While the overall combined ratio for this segment was basically unaffected. The impact of
the transaction to each of the loss and expense ratio components was more observable,
with the resulting increase of 90 basis points to the loss ratio and a decrease of 80 basis
points to the expense ratio. Overall, we were able to reduce our expense ratio by
approximately 400 basis point, mostly as a result of the growth in earned premium. Since
the same quarter one year ago. The retroactive reinsurance transaction just mentioned
and the shift in business mix. Once we adjust for these variations, the underlying
performance of our reinsurance segment will remain stable this quarter. The Mortgage
segments accident quarter combined ratio improved by 650 basis points from the first
quarter of last year. As a result of continued strong underlying performance of the book,
particularly within our U.S. primary MI operations.
The calendar quarter loss ratio of 3.5% compares favorably to the 15.5% in the same
quarter of 2018, due to substantially lower delinquency rates. Part of the difference is also
attributable to increased favorable prior year development, which was approximately 670
basis points higher, than last year. The expense ratio was 22.1% lower by 120 basis points
than in the same period one year ago as a result of a higher level of earned premiums.
Total investment return for the quarter was a positive 270 basis points on a US dollar basis
and a positive 348 basis points on a local currency basis. Contributing to this result was
our decision to extend our portfolio duration slightly during the second half of 2018,
combined with the defensive high-quality position of our fixed income portfolio and the
solid performance of our equity portfolio consistent with the recovery in global financial
markets.
The repositioning of our portfolio, during 2018, combined with the reinvestment of
shorter maturity bonds of higher yields generated higher investment income year-overyear. We also benefited from higher than usual investment income from investment funds
in the quarter. The corporate effective tax rate in the quarter on pre-tax operating income
was 13.1% and reflects the geographic mix of our pre-tax income and a 50 basis point
benefit from discrete tax items in the quarter.
As a result, the effective tax rate on pre-tax operating income excluding discrete items
was 13.6% this quarter higher than the 10.4% rate from the same quarter last year. At this
time, we believe it's still reasonable to expect that the effective tax rate on operating
income will be in the range of 11% to 14% for the full year. As always, the effective tax rate

could vary depending on the level and location of income or loss and varying tax rates in
each jurisdiction.
With respect to capital management, we repurchased approximately 111,000 shares at an
average price of $25.96 per share and an aggregate cost of $2.9 million, under our Rule
10b5 plan, that we implemented during this quarter's closed window period. Our
remaining authorization, which expires in December 2019, stood at $161 million at March
31.
Our debt to capital ratio stood at 14.6% at quarter end, and debt plus preferred to total
capital ratio was 21.2%, down 130 basis points from year-end 2018. With these
introductory comments, we are now prepared to take your questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Question And Answer)
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from
Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Yeah, thank you very much. Mark, I appreciate your comments about CPI and lost cost
trend, look I think that at the very time you make a change in your outlook it might be the
wrong time, but if you look at the past few years, what has been the lost cost trend and
what year you're comfortable making that statement about, what year is two green and
what years can you say yes, we know where the lost cost front wasn't say 2015?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

I think. Yes. So you have to -- it takes about three to four years to redevelop, and we're
talking about primary business to really get a good sense of the CPI. So I think, if you look
at the CPI I mean, we know what it is 1.8%, 1.7%, 1.9% that range has been consistent for
the last two to three years. The pickup in the delta that I talked about the claim inflation
spread above that CPI takes two to three years. So we have some good sense for
probably 2015, 2014, 2016, we still have things developing for more reason underwriting
years. And I would add that it's even more problematic or more difficult to fully assess
when you in a specialty line of business and when you have of course excess policies.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Generally, speaking was '15, '16 about 200 basis points above the lost cost -- above CPI?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

It was a bit above, that I believe. If I last time I checked the numbers about six months ago.
We had a 150 bps above the CPI in trend inflation from '09 to about 2012 and I think it's
Page 6 of 16

since then picked up. So, I'm trying to look at a long-term average it's very hard to pin
down the exact numbers.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

FINAL

And I hope I can get two and a half questions in but there's some related.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Okay

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

I want to understand this structure of your Jebi exposure, I don't know how much you
initially fixed for it, but you're not a big Japan player and you're not a huge property cat
player. So I'm just trying to figure out what happened in the contract that you paid more,
obviously the picks went up there and two, to what extent are higher reinsurance costs
particularly on the Japan renewals that just passed, and then when you get to Florida, and
the Gulf in the mid-year to what extent are the pricing increases we're seeing in property
going to get somewhat swallowed by higher reinsurance costs.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Okay. So that's about 3.5 questions. But I'll sort of take one at a time. The first one on
Jebi. You're quite right our exposure has been on the weight for quite a while. We had
actually, increased our exposure to quake of the Tohoku earthquake, but on the win side
you're right we had been more careful. And this one is having a small amount of limits out
there, mostly on the excess of loss basis and Japan also buys somewhat on the
combined business, but most of all our exposure is on the wind and flood only still to this
day. And really the initial numbers came in at $3 billion as you know developed to about
$12.5 billion to $13 billion we believe as we speak.
What was missed by our ceding company not only by the reinsurance community was the
business interruption and contingent via loss exposures that we're inherent in, exactly the
location, where Jebi hit, and a lot of it had to do with semiconductor that carry a lot of
issues a lot more issues from the BI and CBI perspective, which was not properly
reflected, when you went through the path of the storm and modeled it that through the
your existing portfolio exposure and the ceding companies had done the same thing, did
not see happen, did not see this developing and it just so happened that it created it was
not fully appreciated by most people by the whole market frankly.
So, this is sort of, where we are right now with Jebi. So, you talked about price increase,
we've had we've seen some price increase in April 1st, as you know in Japan. But the price
increase that we saw brought us back to about 20 -- the grade level in 2014. So, with a lot
more subdued and lot more attained than we would have hoped for, based on those that
indicator Josh, knowing us that we've increased somewhat but did not go significant
increase. We are still trying to be patient, in seeing further rate changes.

Page 7 of 16



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td

As we talk about Florida, the initial discussions are that the demand is going to be stable
but the supply of reinsurance is taken a pause. We don't know yet where it's going to go,
but initial sign is that, it's taken a pause which should mean an interesting renewal from a
reinsurance provider perspective.

FINAL

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

I was more interested in your outwards costs more than inwards opportunity. As you pay
more for Reinsurance, does that limit the extent of these rate increases we're seeing in
property lines?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Well, no. Because, the big reinsurance purchase that we would do, would be on the
insurance side. And we don't, we do not have a significant Florida or these kind of
exposures, that would have created the loss into our layer. So we have a very different
exposure from our cat perspective. So it doesn't really factor itself into pricing and it's not
a significant change.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

That's perfect. Thank you very much.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Kumar from Buckingham Research. Your
line is open.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Okay, and good morning. Maybe two questions. The first one is a follow-up on the Jebi
question. Can you also talk about, I guess, what's your -- what was your Trammy [ph]
exposure and also talk about if there were any aviation losses in the accretional loss ratio?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Well, first of all our Trammy exposure is de minimis, we have basically none. And the
question in aviation is not something we're a big participant in. So it's also de minimis in
terms of aviation losses part of the accretional loss.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Got it, that's helpful. The other question, I guess, the only other question, I have is going
back to Joshua's question. There is this sort of debate emerging between E&S pricing
and commercial pricing and you haven't talked about this a lot earlier today. Can you
maybe just spend some time? You gave us a range of minus 5% to plus 8%, and then that
came out to plus 2.3%? Can you just talk about, how you're feeling about pricing versus
Page 8 of 16



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2019-05-01

loss cost trends in some of those lines and what would be the lines, where we're still
trying to get rate increases? And how should we think about 2019 or is it time to sort of
sharpen our pencils and think about margin expansion from here? Or would that be
premature? Thanks.

FINAL

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yeah. So I think the best answer I can give you on what we think of where the margins are?
Is, if you look at where we grew premium in this quarter. That will give you great indication
so as to what our teams think in terms of absolute margin. Margin expansion is one thing,
but it doesn't mean it's necessarily enough to get the return. So we've seen enough
margin expansion in a few lines that we grew our exposure. What is the second part of
the question again?

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

In terms of some of those lines and adequacy in those lines versus loss cost trends?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yes The ones that we grew on a shorter tail of sign mostly, most of the growth has been
in a shorter tail lines and the reason it's a little bit more easier to do so a because the lost
costs are a little bit easier to pin down. You have loss less uncertainty about ultimate loss
costs on the shorter tail lines. So that means that if you think you are perceived you're
preceding a margin safety of rate above loss trend of X, you're more certain you're going
to get this. In other lines of business such as E&S casualty, we like others have seen some
pick up in pricing there, but there's a lot more uncertainty there in terms of what the gap
between lost cost and end rate increase is and I would argue with some of them in some
lines of business even though we would look to have like a 300 pickup let's say in margin
they probably need a bit more than that to really make a big allocation of capital from our
perspective. So it's really a transition and really an incremental marketplace.

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

Yes. One thing I'll add to that just quickly on -- I mean the London market, as you know is
going through a period of dislocation. We benefit from that we're not huge players in
London, but we have a meaningful participation and -- both on the syndicate and the
company side. Who knows, whether that is going to be sustainable for the rest of 2019
and into 2020 but certainly as Marc, alluded to some of the growth, we saw in the
premiums, we wrote in Q1 are specifically related to opportunities in London in particular.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Got it. I will stop here for the moment and I'll reach you. Thanks so much for the answers.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

FINAL

Thank you. Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is
open.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

Hi, thanks. My first question on the reinsurance side. Marc, in response to an earlier
question. You said that supply is taking a pause. So now when we think about supply of
capital in Florida. Is that a comment that you would make to overall capital to alternative
capital to traditional capital, I guess as you think about the buckets of the capital sources
for the upcoming part of renewals you could give us a little bit more color on how you
think this will play out?

A - Marc Grandisson

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Well I don't know how it's going to play out. I'll just talk about the early signs. But in terms
of where it's coming from the supply the pause has been taken by all participants,
because, implicitly in some of the traditional players, some of it is relying on alternative
capital and is also alternative capital stand-alone as well. So, it's really it taking a step back.
There are lot of moving parts in Florida. The (inaudible) benefits, the LAE adjustments and
whatever else, the department asking for buying more limit. I mean there is a lot of
moving parts right now, so people are still and people are waiting to see more up-to-date
numbers, they've been developing as we all know for several quarters now. So
everybody's taken a part.
I think it's a collective, it's not obviously a consensus that's developed by talking to one
another obviously, but it seems to be this taking a pause positioning from the supply. But
we've seen as before these, I want to be open. Sometimes, you see this and at the end
people sort of roll over and do act differently than you would have thought they would
behave. But, I'm just telling you, as we speak last information that I received this morning
about the current state of the overall feeling in the marketplace

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay, thanks, and then back to some comments you guys have been making throughout
the call on the primary insurance market. So it sounds like you guys are finding more
opportunity in the shorter tail lines as opposed to some long tail lines. Just given on,
some concerns about loss cost. Another company earlier today pointed to this being a
casualty driven market upturn. Would you agree with that statement and maybe there's
just, you guys are holding off really pushing for growth on the casualty side, just given -waiting to see how loss translates out?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

So, well, I don't know if it's casualty led, but we've seen in terms of where we've allocated
our efforts. Our efforts in capital such as that Francois mentioned, a lot of it is led by cat
exposure and marine exposure and short tail exposure. So this is where we've been more
Page 10 of 16



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2019-05-01

FINAL

allocating capital for the last six quarters, for three to four quarters and still continue on as
we speak this quarter.
On the liability side for us to have a casualty led we would still need to see some pain in
the marketplace. We're not seeing broad pain yet at least emerging on the insurance
portfolios. What I would tell you and that might probably sort of size or is in line with what
you the comment that was made earlier on some calls is that, the reinsurance market is
actually being a bit more disciplined, a bit more reactive to the casualty placements. And
that tells us indirectly that there's probably a bit more negative perception about the
ultimate results in those numbers but I'm not sure that these results have been published.
Yes.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. And then, you see sorry, one last question. Are you seeing more business come
from the standard market to the E&S market?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Most of what we see is through, the E&S market. Most of the growth except for the UK
regional obviously which is the specific focus but yes, the Lloyd's market, the Lloyd's
business and the E&S market is where we are seeing more opportunities. Yes.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Then sorry, one last question. On the intangible what were a little bit higher than I'd have
thought this quarter I think that's due to your two newer acquisitions, is that Q1 level kind
of a good run rate for this year and can you give us a sense of where the intangibles
amortization expense might come in in out years?

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

Yeah. Well, certainly yes the part one, our practice for the amortization of the intangibles
is linear throughout the year. So you should expect the remainder of 2019 to be at very
much close to the same level that we had in Q1.
In terms, of outer years, we had given direction on specifically on the UGC transaction
how it was going to wind down in 2020 and beyond. So we'd happy to recirculate that and
give you an update on that. But that's very much scheduled and we know where we're at
it's going to be. I don't have the numbers in front of me for 2020, but we can certainly,
yes, give you that.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay, so the UGC numbers aren't changed and it's just up a little bit in the two recent
yields?

Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Your line is
open.

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Hey, good morning. First question is on a mortgage insurance. I believe in Marc in the
prepared remarks, you mentioned even as pricing has become more competitive we use
that term. Is pricing currently becoming more competitive, I know that a lot of it's within
these dynamic pricing models. So it's not as transparent and maybe you could comment
on is that maybe why your market share, I know you don't focus on market share but
maybe that's why your market share seems to like you've fallen quarter-over-quarter?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yeah. I think that, yes, I think it's true that there's well it's hard to see if it's a broad
competition but certainly, there's a lot of dislocation occurring in the pricing, in the
marketplace as a result of all these new risk-based pricing. It's very hard to see what it
means and to even evaluate whether it's down or up or sideways. So we'll reserve
ourselves some more time to evaluate and come to terms to what it means in this
quarter. But certainly we haven't changed our pricing. We held the line and stayed the
course on our risk-based pricing and at the end we just harvest what we put out there and
what's stuck to the marketplace and but it's gonna take a while right markets are going
through establishing their systems, educating the loan originators how it's used and fixing
some of the bugs. So it's going to take several quarters for us to really see if there is truly
that much more price competition. But I think the price competition that I mentioned in my
remarks has been over the several last quarters. I was not specifically talking about this
quarter.

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Okay. That's helpful. And lastly, moving to kind of leverage levels on excess capital. If you
could remind us, leverage is down to 21%-ish historically for UGC It was in the teens. Can
you remind us is there a level that you've kind of soft promised the rating agencies and
then also kind of curious whether holding dry powder is more or less important today
versus in the past?

Yes. Part one to your question, yes, 20% was roughly the number that we were the
leverage level, the leverage level that we were targeting at the time of the acquisition
and we are there today. So I think we're we accomplished what we set out to do and
that's good news. And yes, part B, to your question absolutely dry powder is something
that we always have been firm believers in. Whether it's deploying the capital in a
potential other opportunities, whether they're acquisitions or if this rate environment picks
up steam and gives us the opportunity to put more of capital at work in the business in
any of our three segments, we want to have that ability to do so. So the answer to your
question is yes. Having the flexibility is something that we've always believed in and
thankfully I think we're there right now.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Your line is
open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Hi, good morning, I want to circle back on the reinsurance part of your development, so
even exclude the Jebi adverse evolvement I think net you see a bit of a decrease yearover-year. Can you maybe talk about the moving pieces there?

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

Yeah. A couple of things that I'd say more minor I mean there has been some timing of
some claims that came through that yes impacted favorable or the level of favorable
developments in our reinsurance segment reserves. No question that we didn't -- we've
had a healthy level of reserve releases over the years that were not we never planned for
it. We always observe the data and we always react to the data. It turns out this quarter,
the level of favorable wasn't as high as it has been in prior quarters.
Does it revert back to a higher level next quarter? We don't know we'll find out in three
months. But no question that Jebi was a big part of it. There's a couple of other small
moving parts that are just I think a bit more noise and somewhat (inaudible) in terms of
the timing of the events that affected the aggregate level of PYD on the reinsurance
segment.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

And I think our lost cost trend the discussion Yaron is certainly key into our being prudent
and careful and the way we sort preserves, because things could be shifting and so that is

already part of the part of informing our decisions currently, is not recent but it's certainly
part of that as well.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

FINAL

Understood. I guess what I'm trying to get had those is the over year change, again
excluding Jebi coming more from short tail lines more for longer tail lines?

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

It's a mixed bag. It's a bit of both.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Okay, and then with regards to the U.K. block that you acquired. Should we expect it to be
fully earned in within roughly 12 months period until January of 2020.

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

Yeah. Pretty much right. So the premium it's a ramp up. So it's effectively a start-up. And
we it won't be 50% earned by in 2019 but you're right Q1 into next year like to think that
the run rate of earned premium is going to be a pretty steady. And there's nothing
specific nothing special about their annual policies and that should the accounting should
follow pretty easily from there.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Thanks, Yaron.

Operator
Thank you and our next question comes from Meyer Shields from KBW your line is open.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Thanks, I also wanted to ask about the U.K. acquisition. Once you get past the steady run
rate for earned premiums. Is there any difference in its loss ratio, expense ratio
breakdown and the legacy Arch Insurance segment?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Well it should. I mean there's a lot of moving parts in the expense ratio. What we're trying
to improve on that point, in the U.K. particular and you guys all know about the realities of
the London market and that's generally an expensive place to do business in, so that was
always one of our objectives here is try to reduce our expense ratio specifically from U.K.
side and this acquisition helps us achieve that given it's a more it's a better business
model for us and more efficient on that sense. But the counter to that I will say is we're
Page 14 of 16

FINAL

very there's other opportunities, other investments that we're making within our Insurance
segment that may offset some of that.
So I we don't have complete visibility on everything we're going to do in 2019. But if you're
looking for some view on what the expense ratio may look like for the insurance segment
for the remainder of the year, I would say, no question that Q1 was elevated because
again the lack of our premium on the UK book and the timing of the share based
expenses or competition expenses, by the end of the year we'd like to think that we
could bring it down between the 100 basis points and 200 basis points from where it was
in Q1, but my overall the business that we've acquired is retail business, as you know, it's
not cheap necessarily, it is still there's a lot of commissions as I have to go through, But
the problem which means the loss ratio would hopefully be lowered and then
comparative E&S portfolio.
Having said all this I think with by virtue of the critical math that Francois just talked about, I
think that it should improve the overall expense ratio. But I wouldn't expect it to go to be a
significant improvement.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. No, that's great. Very helpful appreciate it. Looking at mortgage I think Marc you
talked earlier about the benefits of the current economy I don't know how to ask this
without being too politically charged. But do you see that as being vulnerable to next
year's presidential election?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Well, politics are part and parcels of what we have to deal with all the time. Now we're on
the receiving on what's happening out there. The one thing I'll tell you about the politics
we've been worrying about this we've been we've had we've asked that question for a
long time. But the consistent answer on any kind of any administration that was in place
and anybody that runs the FHA, there's clearly a recognition that private market has a
place in delivering the product to the homeowners and providing insurance and
protection.
So we don't see any major change there, we also don't see any change to the GST,
mandate and the way that MI is one of the collateral that's used to bring the LTV down. So
none of those core essence things that are really essential for -- to make sure that the
market exists has been under siege or will be under siege. I mean there might be some
changes to the delivery of the product and we certainly have been participating in some
of those new innovations and we will continue to do so for the future, but, the way we
think about politics and as it regards to MI is. We are agnostic as to what happens. We will
react and are able and willing to help in any way that we can to deliver the product to the
homeowners and to the banking system.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. No understood. Thank you so much.
