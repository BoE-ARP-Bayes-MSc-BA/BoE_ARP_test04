Thanks, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Overall, I am pleased with our team
performed in a difficult market, exercising discipline and executing well across all lines of
business. There are three major themes for the quarter. First, in a period of high cat
activity, heightened macroeconomic uncertainty, and a continuing rate of competition, we
achieved a 6.1% operating return on equity and grew our book value per share, plus
accumulated dividends by 2.8%. Second, we took advantage of market volatility during the
quarter and repurchased a substantial number of shares. Finally, and most impressively,
our team worked hard to achieve growth in all three of our reporting segments.
Today's soft market started several years ago for property cat. We continue to see the
impact of this dynamic at the June 1 renewal, where rates continued to fall, although at a
slower pace than in previous quarters. Despite market conditions, we grew in property cat
due to our leadership position and our continued emphasis on superior customer
relationships. This growth reflected our ability to meet the bespoke needs of our clients
by using our integrated system and by matching good risks with efficient capital. It is
sometimes difficult to demonstrate leadership in a softening market. So, it's gratifying to
see that in times of stress, our customers valued our long-term commitment and continue
to look to us for help managing the risks.
Turning to the casualty and specialty market, which faces many of the same market
dynamics, we were pleased to find opportunities to grow in key areas such as mortgage
reinsurance. Overall, we saw relatively flat ceding commissions compared to prior years.
However, we have seen some reduction in economics over the last 12 months in some
lines of business. We will continue to closely monitor our profitability by line and by
underwriting year and look for further signals of weakening.
Given the current market dynamics, we continue to believe the best opportunity to
improve our performance will come from managing our net underwriting risk and seeking
to increase our participation on the best transactions, while reducing participation on the
worst. We will also to continue build optimized portfolios of risks, as measured by
expected net returns on modeled required capital.
Of course, there's been a great deal of speculation about the recent Brexit vote. While I'll
talk more about how we believe that it might impact our Lloyd's business later on the call,

our global structure and the specific platforms and initiatives in which we have chosen to
invest will continue to provide us access to the markets we currently serve.

FINAL

We had an active quarter from a capital management perspective, with share
repurchasing being roughly equal to net income year-to-date. Our philosophy is to reward
long-term holders of shares when we have excess capital, but only when doing so is likely
to be accretive to tangible book value.
Finally, I want to take a minute to thank Jeff for his efforts on behalf of RenaissanceRe
over the last seven years. Jeff's contributions to our success have been substantial, and
he has worked tirelessly to continue to advance our thinking about risk and capital in ways
that will benefit us long past his retirement.
As we previously announced, Jeff is retiring, and today will be his last call as our CFO and
COO. I am grateful to him for both his counsel and his friendship. I look forward to
introducing Bob Qutub on the next call and know that he will continue to challenge us and
push the team to even greater accomplishment.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.

Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Thanks, Kevin, for those kinds words, and good morning, everyone. Before I begin my
prepared remarks, I just like to say how much I've enjoyed getting know and working with
all of you in the analyst investor community over the last seven years. I know I leave
RenaissanceRe in one of the strongest financial positions in our history and in the capable
hands of a top flight management team.
I'll move on to discuss our results for the second quarter and year-to-date, but before I
do, I'll touch on some highlights from the quarter. While the second quarter was an active
one in terms of insured catastrophe losses for the industry, our losses were very
manageable, and I think, demonstrate our disciplined approach to underwriting in a more
challenging pricing environment.
As we noted in our press release, the total net negative impact of our exposures to the
2016 Texas events and the Fort McMurray wildfires was $41 million. Top line growth was
strong across each of our segments. Some of the main drivers of our growth were some
unique opportunities on the Catastrophe Reinsurance side and continued expansion in
specialty credit.
The decline in interest rates during the quarter, again, resulted in strong mark-to-market
investment performance that helped our reported net income and book value growth.
However, as you might expect, this will likely have negative implications for longer-term
expected returns for the investment portfolio. And lastly, as Kevin mentioned, we also had
one of our more active quarters in terms of capital management through share
repurchases, and I'll discuss that later on in my comments.

FINAL

Moving on to financial results. We reported net income of $136 million or $3.22 per diluted
share and operating income of $67 million or $1.55 per diluted share for the second
quarter. The annualized ROE and operating ROE for the quarter were 12.6% and 6.1%,
respectively. Tangible book value per share, including change in accumulated dividends
grew by 2.8%. On a year-to-date basis, our ROE and operating ROE were 12.1% and 6.1%,
respectively. And tangible book value per share, including change in accumulated
dividends increased by 5.5%.
Let me shift to our segment results beginning with our Cat segment, followed by
Specialty Reinsurance and Lloyd's. In our Cat segment, managed cat gross premiums
written in the second quarter increased 5% from the year-ago period. As Kevin
mentioned, we saw some unique and attractive opportunities for new business as well as
for greater placements on existing business. These more than offset some of the
continued price reductions and repositioning of the book in a soft pricing environment. For
the year-to-date, managed cat gross premiums written declined 2%. This compares with
our top line guidance for a decline of 10%. As a reminder, managed cat includes business
written on our wholly-owned balance sheets, as well as cat premium written by joint
ventures DaVinci, Top Layer Re, and Upsilon.

Bloomberg Transcript

Net premiums written for the Cat segment actually decreased 5% from the prior-year
period during the second quarter, reflecting increased purchases of retro relative to a
year ago. For the year-to-date, net premiums written declined 10%, as we have elected to
cede more premium, as pricing has softened. The second quarter combined ratio for the
Cat unit was 64.3%. Our losses were manageable and well within our expectations for
these types of events.
Our main exposures related to the Texas events, which had a $24 million impact on the
segment results; and to the Fort McMurray fires, which resulted in a $19 million negative
impact. Net favorable reserve development totaled $14 million for the Cat segment in the
quarter. For the first six months of the year, the Cat segment generated an underwriting
profit of $150 million and a combined ratio of 46.2%.
In our Specialty Reinsurance segment, gross premiums written increased by 25% relative
to a year ago. The main driver was significant growth in our credit book, primarily
reflecting increased mortgage reinsurance opportunities that we had been highlighting in
recent quarters. Most other classes of casualty and specialty business were flat to down
relative to a year ago.
For the year-to-date, specialty premiums are up close to 100% from a year ago, reflecting
strong growth in mortgage reinsurance and timing differences related to the exclusion of
Platinum's results from our financials prior to the close of the transaction in March of last
year.
As we have grown our specialty book, we have also increased the use of ceded
purchases to manage our assumed risk and enhance our overall portfolio returns.
Consequently, net premiums written in the Specialty Reinsurance declined 5% in the
second quarter, but were up 61% for the first half of the year. The Specialty Reinsurance

Page 4 of 23

FINAL

combined ratio for the second quarter came in at a profitable 89%. Attritional loss trends
have remained generally benign. The segment reported net favorable reserve
development of $17 million in the quarter. The year-to-date combined ratio on Specialty
Reinsurance was 94.8%.
In our Lloyd's segment, we generated $161 million of gross written premiums in the
second quarter, an increase of 38% compared with the year-ago period. Top line growth
was driven by select opportunities in casualty, property per risk, and property catastrophe
reinsurance. For the first half of the year, gross written premiums increased 19%.
As we have done across our other segments, we have meaningfully increased our
cessions at Lloyd's to manage the risk profile of the business. So, while our gross written
premiums are up 19%, our net written premiums are up 11% for the first half of the year.
The Lloyd's segment came in at a combined ratio of 103.1% for the second quarter. The
segment's results included a $5 million net negative impact related to the Texas events
and Canadian wildfires. The unit reported $2 million of net adverse reserve development
in the quarter. The expense ratio at 42.7% was down relative to a year ago. For the yearto-date, the Lloyd's segment generated a combined ratio of 97.3%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to investments, we reported net investment income of $54 million in the second
quarter. Investment income from fixed maturity securities totaled $46 million for the
second quarter and included a few non-recurring items. Outside of those items, I'd
characterize the recurring income on fixed income securities as probably more in line with
what we've seen in previous quarters.
Our alternative investment portfolio generated a gain of $10 million in the second quarter,
reflecting a rebound in the valuations of our private equity investments and continued
positive performance of our Catlin (13:55) portfolio. The annualized total return on the
investment portfolio was a solid 5.5% in the quarter. A continued decline in treasury yield
and spreads from many investment classes resulted in strong unrealized gains on our
investments.
Our investment portfolio remains conservatively positioned primarily in fixed maturity
investments with a high degree of liquidity and modest credit exposure. The duration of
our investment portfolio remained relatively short at 2.2 years and a stable relative to
where it has been in recent quarters.
The yield to maturity on fixed income in short-term investments was slightly lower at 1.8%
reflecting the decline in interest rates we saw.
Turning to capital on liquidity. Our capital and holding company liquidity positions remain
very strong. During the second quarter, we were active in the market for repurchasing our
shares and bought back 1.7 million shares for a total of $187 million. Since the end of the
quarter, we repurchased an additional 315,000 shares for a total of $36 million. This
brings our year-to-date share repurchases to slightly over $300 million, which is above the
level of net income we have generated in the first half. As we look forward, any decision

FINAL

related to share repurchases will, as always, depend on our view of business
opportunities, the profile of our risk portfolio, and the valuation of our stock.
Finally, before returning – turning the call back over to Kevin, I'd like you to – I'd like to
update you on our top line forecast for 2016. For managed Cat, given that the majority of
our book renews in the first half of the year, we're not updating our guidance at this time.
There isn't much premium that is renewed in the second half, and as such, we believe
that the year-to-date premium decline is a good indication of the forecast for the full year.
For Specialty Reinsurance and Lloyd's, we are maintaining our top line guidance for an
increase of over 20%.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kevin.

Kevin J. O'Donnell

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks, Jeff. I'll divide my comments between our three segments, Catastrophe, Casualty
Specialty and Lloyd's, and I'll also make some comments on the ventures unit. We
performed well over the quarter with respect to our cat renewals. With rates declining
about 5% and teams continuing to push terms and conditions, the market demonstrated
more discipline than in prior years and either pushed back or added rate for coverage
expansions. As I mentioned earlier, we were able to achieve decent growth despite
generally difficult pricing conditions. I am pleased with the growth we achieved as it was at
the right terms and with the right customers, and our underwriters continue to exercise
sound judgment and discipline.
We grew the cat book at this renewal for several reasons. For the first time in several
years, we saw shortfalls during the June 1 renewal, as the number of aggressively priced
programs were unable to achieved 100% placement. In many cases, we were first call for
these clients, and we're able to write deals at relatively better terms than earlier in the
season. Although the market is difficult, our success is primarily a function of us having
better access to business and being a first call market to solve problems for our
customers. In general, the amount of limit purchased by the U.S. market was relatively flat.
Reductions in purchasing from state entities were offset by corresponding increases in
private sector purchases. Overall, supply was ample to meet the demand.
Outside of the U.S. market, the largest renewal in the second quarter was Japan, where
rates were down in the range of 5% to 10%. This was better than what we saw more
broadly internationally where rates were down between 5% and 15%. Even though rates
have moderated somewhat since the 2011 Japanese Tohoku earthquake, we continue to
see opportunities for RenaissanceRe and Top Layer Re to write Japanese business.
Moving on from the recent underwriting results. As Jeff highlighted, it has been a busy
quarter with regard to natural pare losses. The bulk of which came from the Fort McMurray
Canadian wildfire loss and the Texas severe convictive storm event. The Fort McMurray
loss is the largest natural catastrophe loss in Canadian history, and as is often the case
with large events, has certain unique aspects, which will take time to fully develop.

FINAL

We have typically been somewhat underweight on Canadian programs due to our view of
loss potential and pricing, whereby so called non-major perils are seemingly ignored.
Interestingly, we also expect to see reasonable market losses to non-peak retro writers
from this event. While we participate in this market, we have sold less retro than in prior
years as prices moved below a level we could support. Consequently, we were
underweight on the Fort McMurray loss. Further, our ceded program responded to reduce
the net impact of this loss on the portfolio.
The Texas hail numbers consists of losses from 10 separate storms, many of which are
relatively small, localized events, and will largely be retained by insurers and not
transferred to the re-insurance market. Our analysis indicates that while 2016 is a relatively
average year for industry losses from convective storm nationwide, it is the worst year on
record for severe convective storm in Texas. We believe these elements are not related
to a specific predictable pattern of weather. They are more likely explained by a random
clustering of storms around populated areas in Texas, rather than by El Niño or jet stream
patterns alone. Following up on our discussion from the last call, our losses on the
Japanese and Ecuadorian earthquakes earlier in the second quarter were minimal.
Moving over to casualty and specialty, our strong brand and increasingly recognized
expertise in many specialty lines served us well and allowed us to gain access to the
business that we targeted. As an example, we continue to see select growth
opportunities in the financial and credit lines, where we grew strongly in the mortgage
reinsurance space. This is a market where the supply/demand balance is more favorable
and, therefore, relatively attractive. We are recognized leaders in this space having taken
steps to establish to a strong position early on. This has made us a First Call market and a
lead on the best programs. As this book continues to grow, our gross-to-net strategy
becomes more effective, and we believe we can continue to write an attractive portfolio.
As I mentioned in the last call, mortgage reinsurance has the type of business profile that
we like, one in which the market meets our capacity and is looking to transact with only a
select number of well-rated and highly-respected reinsurance counterparties. In general,
we always look to grow our business with core clients in areas in which we're able to
generate the best returns. The characteristics of this market match well with our three
competitive advantages of customer relationships, risk selection, and capital
management. And we are optimistic there will be more opportunities to deploy capital in
this area.
As I alluded to in the opening segment of the call, the softening in specialty casualty
market was initially limited to increased ceding commissions paid to primary companies.
Our analysis showed that these books were achieving good returns even with the
increased ceding commissions, which we were willing to bear. From our perspective, it
was preferable that the entry cost was a fixed reduction in the form of higher ceding
commissions, which was easily – which was an easily ascertainable cost.
Today, ceding commissions remain elevated but largely unchanged from last year. An
issue we are now watching is if rates in underlying portfolio start to slide. This type of
production is more concerning for several reasons. First, these books develop slowly, and
it can take years to recognize under pricing. Second, unlike fixed reductions in margin due
Page 7 of 23



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2016-07-27

FINAL

to elevated ceding commissions, price decreases in underlying portfolios can be more
uncertain and difficult to accept.
We have a strong underwriting team and have built good tools to allow us to better
understand changes in the underlying business. I am pleased with the gross premium
growth in this segment, because the business provides diversification to our portfolio,
which remains dominated by cat risk. As the portfolio grows, we are increasingly utilizing
our gross-to-net strategy to optimize our specialty book. This also affords us increased
access to risk, which in today's market is more critical than ever before. And most
importantly, we have selectively chosen the most profitable classes and worked hard to
achieve desired signings on the best business. A specific sample is our early move into
mortgage business in 2009, which I previously discussed.
As I've noticed in the past, our Lloyd's syndicate will have good quarters and bad quarters.
While the combined ratio of this quarter kicked above 100%, including losses from both
Fort McMurray and the Texas hail storms, year-to-date Lloyd's is profitable. As we
continue to grow this book, our goal is that it will become more consistently profitable
over time.

Bloomberg Transcript

The growth this quarter in Lloyd's has come from a few sources. Firstly, there's natural
organic growth in a number of underlying portfolios we support on a proportional basis at
Lloyd's. Secondly, having added to our underwriting team early this year, we have seen an
immediate impact of expanding our skill set. And lastly, some of the growth witnessed this
quarter is testament to the value of having multiple platforms to support our clients.
With respect to the UK's decision to exit the European Union, we believe the impact on
our Lloyd's business will be minimal. Lloyd's has a number of pre-existing relationships
with Europe, and we'll be working hard to bridge any potential gaps. Our most vulnerable
exposure in terms of potential loss business is on insurance business from Lloyd's to
Europe, which is only about $2 million or less than 1% of our syndicate premium.
Our ventures unit had a good quarter, contributing to our broader investment results and
our ability to execute our gross-to-net strategy. Specifically, our joint ventures continue to
perform well, driven by investment returns, and we maintain our disciplined approach to
selecting risks that fit our appetite.
Our strategic investments also continue to perform well despite some choppiness in the
equity market. The ability of our ventures unit to innovatively match risks and capital has
long been a differentiator for RenaissanceRe. We will continue to evaluate opportunities
to grow in this area and structure transactions that are consistent with our disciplined
approach.
In closing, I'm pleased with our June 1 renewal, and the steps we have taken to reduce
our peak market risk going into this year's wind season. Across all three of our segments,
we have deepened our relationship with key clients and expanded our ceded program to
improve capital efficiency of our portfolio. We have executed well in a difficult market,
driving growth in areas we found attractive, while maintaining our underwriting discipline.

While there's still work left to do, overall, I'm proud of our team for what we've
accomplished in order to maintain our underwriting leadership position heading into the
second half of 2016.

FINAL

And with that, I'll turn the call over to questions. Thanks.

Q&A
Operator
And your first question comes from the line Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs. Please
go ahead.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Thanks so much. I guess, Kevin, one question, to start out, is how would you look at the
first half of 2016 compared to what a normal-ish year would look like for rent today, given
the mix of business that you have and that you expect to move towards in the future?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell

Bloomberg Transcript

So, I think, the strategy that we have in 2016 is reasonably consistent with the strategy we
had in 2015. And looking at what's likely to occur in 2017, I think, 2017 is likely to be more
difficult than 2016, but I think our strategy will continue. We've increased the scale of the
organization quite considerably, both becoming deeper in the lines that we're in, but also
opening new platforms, which allow us to serve our clients better.
Looking at the Lloyd's book of business, we are working hard to maintain profitability
there. I think, we've done a good job hedging the portfolio. And as we continue to grow
the benefits of those hedges or the increased ceded that we have there will continue to
endure to our. With Specialty and Casualty, we're increasingly being recognized as a lead
in many lines. And, I think, that will continue to provide us with opportunity. The mortgage
book has performed well, and we see that as a continuing area of growth for us.
And Cat's one that, I think, looking at what at happened at 6/1 is a little different than what
happened at 1/1. We saw more discipline at the 6/1 and 7/1 book than what we saw at 1/1.
I'm not sure that necessarily translates to what can happen at the 1/1 renewal for 2017. But
to be perfectly honest, our strategy doesn't rely on being able to call the market. Well, if
that's where the market is, we'll build a performer for 2017, and then we will execute the
strategy, and which I think will be largely similar to the strategy that we have in 2017 and
2016.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it. I mean, I guess, more simplicity thinking just ROE. I mean, first half of year, your
average about a 6% ROE, $50 million in Cat, or $40 million, depending on how you're
looking at it during the first half of the year. Is there anything about – I think if – is the Cat
load higher than you would think? In a more normalized environment, is it about right? And

Page 9 of 23



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2016-07-27

what are put and takes for that 6% to be higher from here, assuming that we're at some
sort of bumping along the bottom line Cat, and we don't see a shift in margins in that
business?

FINAL

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Sure. It's a difficult market currently to touch on. It's been difficult in Cat for a while, and
increasingly, we're monitoring more closely what's going on in the specialty line.
Investments, obviously, I won't spend a lot of time on that, but that's going to be more of
a challenge going forward for everybody. We're not trying to optimize returns in a single
quarter, or even on the single year. We're trying to build an optimal portfolio against the
full set of outcomes. I think, in looking at the first quarter, we had a good quarter, a low cat
quarter, but the value of our hedges cost us return. In the second quarter, we hedged our
portfolio beyond just the losses that occurred, but we did receive some value for that.
There's a cost associated, I think, for doing the right thing in difficult markets. And I believe
that we're doing that, but we're managing risk, I think, well across the entire portfolio, well
across the whole distribution. And according to the measures that we have, we're still
producing output to the market. So, without getting specific as to what returns might be, I
think, we're looking to build the franchise – to be a more valuable franchise next year in
five years and 10 years. And if that's at the cost of current year earnings, that's okay,
because what we're doing now, I think, puts us on the stronger platform going forward.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it. That's very fair. Thanks for that. And, I guess, just a couple of quick numbers, I
wondered if I could, Jeff. Good luck with the where you go – with what's next in front you,
Jeff. But fixed yield, should assume the Q1 $36 million is better starting point than the $46
million in the second quarter. Sounds like there's some one-timers there. Just want to
confirm that. And in the Lloyd's business, the operating expense number, the dollar drops
in the second quarter which contributed to the lower ratio. I just wanted to get some
context on that as well.

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Okay. On the fixed income securities, yeah, I would say – I wouldn't put too fine a point on
it. I think the – on the last few quarters, the recurring income on fixed maturity investment
has been between $36 million and $38 million. I think, it's going to be – my guess is it's
going to be around that number, perhaps around the higher end of that range going
forward. But, yeah, there were a couple of onetime items in the quarter that created that
anomaly. And the second question is about Lloyd's, right – the Lloyd's expenses?

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Yeah. The operating expense at Lloyd's, yup. Just sort of seeing the growth there,
normally, I mean, I would expect that the operating expense maybe would be flat, and
then, you'd get some leverage. But it looks like you got both. You got leverage on the top
line, but also the notional dollar went down.

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah. Michael, I think, probably a better way to look at it is it's – I think for the first six
months, it's about flat or maybe just slightly higher. I wouldn't – any given quarter, I
wouldn't point too much at, but I think we don't see any significant expense growth in the
near term at Lloyd's. So, I'd say, the first six months compared to the last six months is
probably a good proxy.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it. Great. Thanks so much.

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Your next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar from Macquarie. Please go ahead.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

Thanks, and good morning. And thanks for all your help, Jeff, over the years.

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Thank you.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

Just two or three, I guess, quick questions. Maybe a follow-up to Michael's question too.
The first question is on the discussion on the cat rate. And I think you mentioned maybe a
5% number for June 1 renewals. And I know that you don't sort of look for that when you
think of the book. Did that number change materially for July 1 renewals? And I know that's
a different book altogether? The reason why I asked is a competitor mentioned that cat
pricing stabilize from 6/1 to 7/1, but the latter seeing flat renewals. So, I'm just trying to get
some perspective on that.

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
So – yeah. Thanks for that. Firstly, generally, the June, July renewals were better than what
we anticipated when we built our pro forma back in October of 2015. The – going in, I
think, the comment that you're making, renewals that were done further away from June 1
or July 1 were more competitive than those that were done closer to the actual expiration
of the contracts. So, we did see some improvement of terms and some hardening of
underwriting stances, with regard to expanded terms, as we got to the actual renewal of
either the June 1 or July 1. So, it wasn't a static renewal. Later renewals were more – early

renewals were more competitive than late renewals. And the overall renewal was better
than we anticipated when we built the pro forma for the June, July renewal period.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

Got it. That's helpful. The other question I had was on – I think, on the cat side in the
opening remarks. And forgive me if I mixed up with all the calls. You mentioned the
increase in retro purchase this year. And did you describe what areas will that protect in
your book?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
I did mention that we bought more retro, but I didn't give any color as to the type of retro
that we bought. Looking across the overall cessions that we're making, increasingly, we
are taking the gross-to-net strategy that's been effective on the property cat book and
deploying it into Lloyd's and deploying it into Casualty, Specialty. Once books become of
size, we have more flexibility as to how to think about putting different types of capital
against it.

Bloomberg Transcript

Different books have different strategies for ceding as well. So, if you take the mortgage
book, we are seeing more opportunity, presenting itself more quickly than we want to
build our net portfolio, and we're finding opportunities to represent other capital that
want to leverage off our underwriting, our tools and our ratings to give them access to
that business. So, the combined risk capital that we're deploying and the fee capital that
we're generating, really works to great advantage on that book of business.
Looking at property cat, our strategy is much more around managing the net retained risk
that we're taking and balancing the portfolio. And the one comment I'll make regarding
the cessions that we made this year is our net risk going into wind season for Atlantic
hurricane is less this year than what it was last year. So, despite the growth we are able to
achieve in property cat over the course of the quarter, we're still managing our net risk to
be lower.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

Got it. And the – so, the Florida specific piece that was non-renewed last year, that hasn't
changed?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
The Florida...

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

Specific retro you had previously.

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Yeah. We – I guess, I'd make two comments on that. The reduction that we have going
into Atlantic wind season comes from really two things. It's the change in our overall

FINAL

ceded program, without getting into specifics. But also, we diversify the books, so the
growth that we had, actually, we deployed less limit in Florida this year with Florida –
indigenous Florida companies than we did last year. What we talked about last year is that
we were taking Florida risk in a different way, more through nationwide programs that
have Atlantic hurricane risk. That trend continued this year, although to a lesser extent, but
we do have slightly less limit deployed in the indigenous Florida market, and we have a
different ceded program, which has reduced the net risk.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

Thank you. Thanks for the clarification. And final question, and I'll get off. In terms of – we
always talk about consolidation, and there's always chatter, and again, there is chatter
today, this is sort of a step back question, do you think RenRe would – being a private
company, would that serve you better, would that benefit you in these market conditions,
or you see that as a non-factor? I'm thinking about the competitive advantages of being
private versus public for a very strong franchise such as you in these market conditions.

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks for the question. I think – I love our position in the current market. We benefit from
having DaVinci, which is private and access to private investors coming in. And we also
benefit from being a publicly traded company and having access to the equity market. So,
I think, having the balanced approach from where we are and the way we're executing our
strategy is preferred. And we really enjoy having the most diverse group of capital that
we can possibly attract and bringing it to our customers and our clients.

Yes. Good morning. I was hoping we could just spend – I had a few more questions. Just,
first, in terms of the Specialty, you guys didn't update the guidance for the year. Is that just
that you kind of just don't really – it's a little bit of a lumpy business, I know, just being with
the mortgage, if – based on your commentary, expect you continue to see growth there
kind of as we go through 2016?

I'm sorry, Elyse, if I wasn't clear. Our expectation for Specialty is that it will be up over 20%
on the year.

FINAL

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Yeah. But I guess, I mean, you've seen pretty strong growth in the first half of the year, so
that would imply, I guess, a slowdown in the second half of the year, or was that just the
20% growth more just a half-year too comment?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
No. It's a full year comment. It's just taking into account the timing differences over which
the business is originated during the year, and the fact that, as you said, it is a bit of a
lumpy business. We don't want to put too fine a point on percentage increases in the
book.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Thanks. And then, Kevin, just following up on some of your market commentary.
Just from some of the calls that we've heard throughout this season. I think, the overall
comments that I've put together is that we're kind of getting a bit close to a bottoming of
reinsurance market. No one's really kind of wanted to call for price increases from here,
but maybe we'll stay around this level for a while. Would you agree with that? And then, if
you can just start to give a little bit of some comments on January 1 just based on where
we sit today.

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Sure. Let me comment a little bit about the one different thing that is – we talked about on
this call is the fact that we grew our property cat book, which we haven't done for quite a
long time. That growth comes from opportunities that were broader than just what
occurred in the Florida-specific market. So, within the Florida-specific market, we saw
programs that struggled to get placed, and we were able to come in at terms that were –
better terms than what the market saw. So, that is generally good sign.
The other side of that coin is, I think, it's difficult to extrapolate what happens in Florida to
the 1/1 renewal, because the 1/1 renewal is a much broader book of business than what is
really Atlantic windstorm-focused, mid-year renewal. But the signs of what we saw at 1/1 –
sorry, at 6/1 are good. I think, for us, whether it's – the bottom rates are up 5% or rates are
down another 5% doesn't really change the way that we're going to execute on the
market. So, we spend a lot less time really thinking about whether we're at the bottom
and look at what is likely to occur and build the portfolio out.
A lot is going to happen between now and 1/1/17, so I think, it's a little early for us to start
thinking about building a pro forma. We'll sit down in October, make an assessment as to
where the market is, and then build a pro forma and have a much keener sense as to
where we'll ultimately estimate 2017 to be.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. And then, Jeff, on the alternative investments that did rebound this quarter, what's –
for modeling purpose, what's kind of a normal return that you would assume on those
investments on a quarterly basis?

FINAL

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

We don't have – I wouldn't suggest there is a normal, Elyse. It's – I think, the way we think
of it is on an expected basis is kind of tracking the S&P 500. But given the makeup of it,
that's – there – it's hard to say. But we generally think about it as kind of tracking the S&P
500.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. And then, one capital question, the share repurchase did pick up this quarter. Given
that we're now in wind season, would you guys book, I guess, maybe to curtail repurchase
a little bit, or is it just kind of more based on opportunity and evaluation of the stock. How
does that kind of come into play this year in your decision-making?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Well, the third quarter is rarely the largest quarter for share repurchases in any given
calendar year. And I'd probably say this year is no exception to that. But it tends to be
really based on opportunities we see for the business, the profile of our risk portfolio and
just evaluation of stock as I said in my current – or in my prepared remarks. So, I'd say, that
other things being equal, we expect to be in the market over the course of the remainder
of the year. As I said, we have a very strong capital and liquidity position. I wouldn't worry
too much or think too carefully about what – how much we do in any specific quarter. We
try and steer away from that. But other things being equal, I expect us to be in the market
over the course of the remainder of the year.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

So, Kevin, you mentioned mortgage risk have been growing very strong, and we saw a lot
of competitor coming into that place. I just wonder, could you talk more about your sort of
underwriting competitive advantage in that and risk management in that, particularly longtail business, as well as sort of what capital requirements is in this line of business?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Sure. Currently, within RenRe, we take mortgage risk in three areas, and we're constantly
looking at those three areas and making sure that we're managing not only the risk we
have, but the opportunity that exists. So, within the investment portfolio, we're taking
traditional securities, traditional mortgage type risks. Within the ventures team, we have
an ownership asset, which is a private mortgage insurer. And then our reinsurance book is
really the highest level broken up between two groups of players. And the private
mortgage is about two-thirds of the premium, and the GSEs are about one-third. The
private mortgage book is more quota share, and the GSE book is more excess of loss.

Bloomberg Transcript

Looking across each of those, we're constantly optimizing what is the right place for us to
deploy the capital that we're allocating to this business. We think, there's still good
opportunities, but we do agree with you that there's more people – or more competitors
looking at this space. And we anticipate that it'll become more competitive over time.
We think we've built an advantage in it, having gotten into the business in 2009, having
strong underwriting talent committed to it, and increasingly, have built proprietary tools,
as well as leveraging externally valuable tools. Finally, having the ratings that we have, puts
us in a preferred position to many of our competitors as well. So, I think we do have
unique capabilities here. We do see continued opportunity, but I think, you're right, as
more people look at this it's likely to become increasingly competitive.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

In terms of capital requirements?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
The capital requirements in the reinsurance book on an economic basis is not large,
because they're balance sheets are not built to support tail risk within the mortgage book.
They're built to support tail risk within the property cat book. We do have limits on each of
deals that we have, so we're not taking on limited risk here, even the quota shares are
capped. And we have a finite level of risk that we – we'll work towards across all three
segments that we're taking risk in. But it's something that we're – as opportunity changes,
we will amend. More opportunity we'll allocate more capital, less opportunity we'll allocate
less capital. But we're not at the point, where we're capital constrained within the
mortgage business.

Great. My second question is on the reserve side. I would just go through each of your
segments. If you look at Cat segment, since Katrina, if you like look at your case reserve,
almost reduced by two-third from $600 million – $700 million down to like $200-ish million.
You have some small releases of 2015 events in this quarter. So, just wonder, is there –
since we haven't seen large scale event over the past several years, does it mean
naturally the potential pool for future release is becoming smaller? That's on the Cat side.
And then the second bucket, you mentioned you have some actual (48:16) assumption
changes in your Specialty business on the reserve side. Could you elaborate on that?
And the third, on the Lloyd's. We saw some small adverse development. This is probably
early of your book. I just wonder sort of like, because you're building out Lloyd's, how do
you make sure your reserve is prudent like – as you have did – always did in the
Catastrophe book.

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Let me try and take those, and I'll let Kevin add in if I miss something. So, on the cat
side, Kai, I would say, certainly, as you described the level of remaining ACR and IBNR up
against old cats, is certainly much lower. I would say that, still, the two largest prior year
cats that we have outstanding in terms of ACR and IBNR, the storm Sandy and the Thai
floods. But in dollar terms, those – they aren't horribly large events, but they are still, in
percentage terms, what we thought our initial losses are still reasonably or higher than
most.
On the Specialty side, we do, usually every first or second quarter engage in a review of
our specialty loss assumptions in our reserve calculations. We did make a change in the
quarter, and the magnitude of that change in terms of the Specialty and Casualty reserves
was about $6 million favorable. So, that was the only change – or that was the net impact
of the change in assumptions that we made for this year.
And as it relates to the Lloyd's, the adverse development there it was relatively small. We
don't – I don't – I wouldn't ascribe it to anything significant. Our reserving methodologies
at Lloyd's are very closely aligned with our reserving methodologies elsewhere in the
company, and we believe we're very well-reserved there. It was just a combination of very
small things that resulted in the adverse development at Lloyd's.
Kevin, you want to add anything else?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
I think, that's exactly right. I think, the two things I would add – you asked the question as
to how do we think about the Lloyd's reserve or how do we know. One benefit we have in
Lloyd's is we do report into Lloyd's, and they look at the reserves that we have by line. So,
we get feedback on that basis, and it continues to give us comfort about the overall
reserve levels we have within the syndicate.

FINAL

And then secondly within the Casualty and Specialty, Platinum, when we purchased them
had great reserving tools. Our first priority in the integration was to get everything on a
single platform and, increasingly, we're improving our tools by looking at what was best
within the RenRe framework and what was best within the Platinum framework. So, there
might be some continued shifting around of stuff, as we change methodologies or
combine methodologies.
But again, I agree with everything that Jeff said. We're comfortable with our reserves, and
I don't – we're not seeing any signals at this point that are concerning with the overall level
of reserve that we have by class or by underwriting year.

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Okay. Great. And then, any thoughts on kind of appetite from the alternative kind of
capital providers at Florida renewals, and maybe your renewals, any change?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
I think, it's harder to press the point to Florida, because there's not a specific Florida
sidecars that we've deployed right now. I'd say there's still interest in capital coming into
this space, where they're saying that reinsurance generally is attractive against other
alternatives that they're looking at. We've been disciplined about keeping our facilities
roughly the same size as we have in the past. We did add a little bit of capital but not
worth highlighting in any material way to both Upsilon and to our Medici Fund but we kept
DaVinci, the same size as it was previously.

Q - Quentin McMillan

{BIO 19411547 <GO>}

FINAL

Hi. Thanks very much, guys. Can you just elaborate on one of the points you made earlier
and help me to try understand? You said that higher ceding commissions within the
Specialty market is less concerning to you than a decrease in pricing. And just from my
perspective, one year paying a little bit more, one year getting a little bit less. Can you
sort of help just tie those two things together of why the pricing dynamic is less – is more
concerning to you than the increase in the ceding commissions?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Sure. What I mean to highlight there is reduction in economics is reduction in economics.
The difference between the two is that ceding commission is fixed and known definitively
at times zero, where you need to monitor books very carefully, and it takes a while to
figure out whether underlying rates are moving up or moving down. Our concern now is
that there could be rate pressure coming in on the underlying books, and we're spending
a lot more time monitoring those reductions because they are less transparent than an
increase in ceding commission. Either one has the same net effect on the overall returns
on the margins on the business, which is one is harder to figure out than the other.

Q - Quentin McMillan

{BIO 19411547 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks. Just a quick numbers question as well. The credit business that you wrote,
is that basically a 100% mortgage, or is – what is the mortgage number in there?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
For the growth, it is – the vast majority of the growth is coming from the mortgage
business. We do have some renewals in there for the trade credit stuff. But in thinking
about the growth, the vast majority of it is coming out of the mortgage markets.

Q - Quentin McMillan

{BIO 19411547 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks. And then last, you guys have – you were talking about the cession strategy
and appreciate the color there, but can you just – is there any sort of optimization of the
portfolio or optimal level that you guys are kind of moving towards? Is it just what the
market bears and gives you, or are you generally trying to move the net to gross lower,
and we should be thinking about that movement continuing over the next 6 months to 12
months at least?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
I would say, broadly, it's really a function what's available in the market and whether you
can add that your portfolio and improve net returns. We don't have a bias at this point to
try to increase or reduce cessions. And I would say, the opportunity from now to year-end
certainly for increased cessions is pretty minimal.
Looking at next year, the only – the place that we – let me divide the world just between
casualty, specialty and property cat. Property cat, the net risk we retain and the cessions
that we apply to get there changed the level of capital committed to the business. Within
casualty and specialty, it really is around optimizing the risk profile and the risk return/fee
Page 20 of 23



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2016-07-27

return we're getting on the business, but it doesn't necessarily change capital. So, it's two
different philosophies for the different books, but there will be no change in the way
we're thinking about our ceded between now and year-end, and probably limited to
opportunity to increase the cessions.

FINAL

Q - Quentin McMillan

{BIO 19411547 <GO>}

Okay. Just to quickly follow-up on that, within the casualty, specialty, then you're saying
that's more about the risk profile, so to kind of follow-up on Brian's question within the
retro market and sort of buying some of that. It's not about the fact that you might see
more attractive pricing in the retro market, it's really about the optimal portfolio strategy?
And are you seeing more attractive pricing in the casualty retro market?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
For ceded or for...

Q - Quentin McMillan

{BIO 19411547 <GO>}

For ceding that, sorry.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
I think the cessions that we have in 2016 compared to the cessions we have in 2015 are
more favorable to us, but that's really – I think, as people become more comfortable with
us as underwriters and being partners of ours, they generally will share more of the
economics back to the cedent. I wouldn't say, broadly, we're seeing a material change in
the economic benefit of cessions between last year and this year, though. I think, that's
normal market behavior what I'm commenting on.

FINAL

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Yeah. Good morning, everyone. My first question relates to – I don't know if you've
listened to other conference calls but a very widely listened to conference call this
morning suggested that the catastrophe activity in the quarter was in line with long-term
global averages. I'm wondering what you think about that? Is there a reason to all this, and
what it means if true for your ROE current pricing levels?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
So, I did not listen to that call this morning, so I'm not familiar exactly what the
commentary is. I think, looking at it, I think, I don't have an answer to your question as to
whether it was high or low relative to the worldwide cat expectations of our competitors.
But I think, what we try to comment on is it was a big loss in Canada, as Canadian market
is protected differently than the U.S. market. A lot of that'll come to the reinsurance
community. And the Texas events, even though we discussed this Texas convective
storm, it really was 10 events. I don't think it certainly showed that there was an increase in
convective storm activity in the United States, but it was pretty bad for Texas and for
Texas companies.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

That's fair. And on the Canadian wildfire, to what extent has the industry reinsurance been
exhausted for that event? And if numbers were to go up, would that go back to primary
layer, or could reinsurance loss continue to rise for that event?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Yeah. I think it depends on – it's kind of by company within Canada. But in general, our
view is to where the most likely estimate of losses that we could see continued increase
in primary loss and increase in reinsurance losses. The analysis that we did was, as we
normally do bottom up and top down, we did a much more granular bottom up analysis.
And we feel pretty comfortable with our estimate, even at a larger than what's discussed
industry loss.
