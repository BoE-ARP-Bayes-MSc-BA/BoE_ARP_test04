{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. This is Gianandrea Roberti, I'm Head of Investor Relations at
Tryg. We are hosting this call this morning to present you the acquisition of Alka. I'll – a
few short words, I'll leave the word to Morten.

Morten Hübbe
Thank you, Gian, and good morning from me as well and, particularly, thank you for
spending the time with us this morning. This is a special day for us with very good news
and an important driver in the value creation for Tryg in the future.
We start on slide 2, announcing this important acquisition for us. It's quite clear that Alka
will strengthen our core Danish private business in a very high-quality customer segment.
Alka having delivered average combined ratio of 84% in the last ﬁve years on average. If
we look at Alka's technical results during the last 12 months to September this year, it is
more than DKK 300 million, and we expect run rate synergies of DKK 300 million in 2021,
which would be the third full year after authority approval.
There's no doubt that there's very large synergy opportunity to improve both businesses.
There are areas where Alka is clearly more advanced than Tryg and vice versa areas where
Tryg is more advanced than Alka. Christian will return to the synergies. But just to give you
a few examples, we can see, for instance, that fraud, which was the theme we discussed at
Page 1 of 17

FINAL

the Capital Markets Day. Alka is signiﬁcantly more advanced than Tryg and even more
advanced than our ambitions for the next three years. It is also clear that on cost of sales,
which we discussed on the Capital Markets Day Alka is signiﬁcantly ahead of Tryg. Those
will drive amongst others signiﬁcant ﬁnancial impact in Tryg.
On the other hand, it's clear that there are number of areas where Tryg is more advanced.
For instance, we showed our advantage of claims procurement, driving a lot of value in
Tryg. This is not an area that Alka has developed in an area where we can add signiﬁcant
synergies in the Alka business. And then of course, we have a number of areas where
there are overlapping functions which will drive synergies. But Christian will get back to
that.
We will issue DKK 4 billion of equity which is already fully underwritten. This will be
accretive to earnings in the ﬁrst full year, which will be 2019. And then we will have high
single digits accretion by 2021. Also on this slide, we reconﬁrmed our extraordinary
dividends of DKK 1 billion expected to be paid in Q1 2018.

Bloomberg Transcript

We turn to slide 3. We comment that this is a very rare opportunity to buy a high quality
business in our core Danish private market. We show a headline purchase price of DKK
8.2 billion, but bear in mind that that includes excess capital of DKK 2.5 billion, which can
be released in the transaction in Alka, and therefore, the actual price for the operations
we're buying is DKK 5.7 billion.
As I mentioned, the business we are acquiring is generating a technical proﬁt of DKK 325
million rolling 12 months. And we intend to deliver merger beneﬁts of DKK 300 million by
2021. Financing supported by our largest shareholder, TryghedsGruppen, and of course,
we're very pleased that this will drive higher earnings growth. It will also drive a higher
potential for dividend growth in the future. We show also here a pro forma solvency ratio
calculation after the transaction and the capital increase.
On slide 4, we elaborate on the strategic rationale. We will clearly deepen our presence in
Tryg's core market segment. We will grow the market share and Denmark in general by
4% and more importantly by 6% in the private lines market, as this is predominantly a
private lines business.
We are, very importantly investing in what you already know is our most eﬃcient and most
important business. And Alka brings very high-quality customers and high-quality
business. We see that over a number of years, the loyalty and satisfaction amongst Alka
customers has been extremely high, while at the same time delivering very strong growth
and very strong ﬁnancial results.
And through Alka, we'll have – Tryg will have a long-term business with the unions and the
union members. And bear in mind that in Tryg stand-alone, we already have more than 75
years of experience working with unions to build upon. As part of the transaction, we've
entered into contracts with the current union customers for ﬁve years, which is the legal
maximum period.

FINAL

Also important that the union members and all other customers of Alka will become
members of TryghedsGruppen, and as a result, they will also in the future receive the
membership bonus, which for the past two years has been 8%, and of course, that
reinforces our belief that the partnership will create value, both for the members and
customers, and for Tryg.
As I've said, it's quite clear that Tryg can learn in a number of areas from Alka. It's quite
clear that in, for instance, online sales but also the work with data pricing and a number of
technical skills also including fraud detection, Alka is very, very advanced.
On slide 5, we have shown our Capital Markets Day targets, and then we have shown an
update post this transaction. Importantly, we shown updates of the technical result target
for 2020, previously DKK 2.8 billion, increased to DKK 3.3 billion, of course driven by the
current earnings ability of Alka, and then of course, the synergies driven in both Tryg and
Alka as a result of the transaction. And then bear in mind that the full peak of the
synergies is not in 2020, but in 2021.

Bloomberg Transcript

You'll also see that we have revised our ROE targets back to 21% post tax. This is of course
a function of the DKK 4 billion of incremental equity. And, of course, while 23% to 21% is a
reduction, when you do the math, it's actually a tightening of the ﬁnancial targets on ROE,
and that reconﬁrms our focus to work with our balance sheet and work with capital
repatriation. And then, ﬁnally, please notice that we are improving our combined ratio
target from 87% to 86%.
If we turn to slide 6, there's no doubt that we have always admired the success of Alka
business from the outside, particularly, the ability to combine strong combined ratio
results with growth, above market growth level and very high customer satisfaction. The
quality of the business is supported by strong relationships with the unions and given our
more than 75 years experience with unions, we are certain that we can drive that in a
strong way forward.
We show that the historical evidence of 84% combined ratio for Alka standalone over the
past ﬁve years indicates a very strong business. And in addition to the ﬁnancial metrics,
it's quite clear that we attracted the strengths of the technical capabilities, but also, the
digital market presence. We show here for instance that in 2017, 36% of Alka sale is online,
of course, with a substantially lower cost of sale, while Tryg's Danish proportion of online
sale is extremely limited.
And then, also, we see a very strong Alka brand awareness and we show that on slide 7.
Now Alka might not be as large as some of the other insurers shown on this graph; as I
mentioned, a 4% Danish market share and importantly, a 6% Danish private lines market
share, but what you also see from this graph is that the brand awareness is very strong.
Only Tryg is ahead of Alka and in other words, we're combining brand awareness in
Danish insurance, number one and number two, which clearly bodes for strong market
positioning in the future. We believe we can further capitalize on the strength of both
brands, both to build even higher customer satisfaction, grow the business and deliver
strong ﬁnancial results in the process.

FINAL

On slide 8, we show a little bit of the split of the business; there's no doubt that the Alka
business is very focused on Danish private non-life, which is almost 80% of the total top
line, and of course that is highly complementary to Tryg's business.
On slide 9, we show that over the past 10 years, Alka has consistently outgrown the Danish
non-life market, while delivering very high customer satisfaction and very strong
combined ratios in the process. We also show the historical development in market share,
which of course, gives us signiﬁcant conviction regarding the strength of Alka's prospects.
We believe it is realistic to take Alka through also in the future, another stage of signiﬁcant
growth as part of the Tryg family, but of course very importantly, it's continuing to build
upon the strong ﬁnancial result track record.
Finally, on slide 10, before handing over to you, Christian, we show market shares where,
clearly, Alka adds signiﬁcant presence to our core lines of business. Alka has
approximately 6% in private lines Denmark and here we show a little bit of the product
split where Alka brings 5% to 6% in each of motor insurance, accident and health, and ﬁre
and property.
And over to you, Christian.

Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

Thank you, Morten. And as you can see on slide 11, Alka have had a long track record of
very good combined ratios, and they are here compared to Tryg's private business. So,
very much in line with how Tryg's private business has been performing. There has been a
period of elevated run-oﬀ in Alka, and during our due diligence, we actually found that
we were dealing here with a company that was even more conservative in their reserving
practice than Tryg has been. So, a very strong due diligence and very strong balance
sheet when looking at the reserves of Alka.
The 2016 numbers that kind of peaks up a little bit is, however, some work that was done
on the reserving models, giving a peak to the results, but in 2017 we see the results
coming back down to historical levels – or the combined ratio coming back down.
On page 12, which is basically our DKK 300 million beneﬁt, merger beneﬁt, and I think it's
important here that we're calling it merger beneﬁt. From our point of view, we can see a
lot of things that we can learn from Alka and that Alka can learn from us. Morten has
already mentioned on the claims side and we see here about 45% of the DKK 300 million
is coming from claims. When we, at the Capital Market Day, showed that we are detecting
1.5% of fraudulent claims, Alka is excess 4% of detection. That's 3 percentage points more
detection than Tryg is doing. Basically, this is where a lot of the value is going to be driven
and where are going to learn a lot from Alka, taking their models and their data analytical
models to improve our business in Tryg's name (14:17).
On the procurement side, this is an area that Alka has not been working on for the past, as
much as Tryg has, and for example, looking at – when we showed on the Capital Market
Day that we have a 6.6% average better procurement on auto, Alka does not have this,

FINAL

but when we merge together, Alka will beneﬁt from this procurement agreement that we
have and thereby giving us better performance in Alka. On the cost optimization, we
basically are talking about double functions and a lot of these double functions will be
reduced by natural churn. The other 25% of revenue optimization and commercial best
practice, Morten has already mentioned their presence online; with 36% online sales, they
have been working with cost of sales over the past many years, where Tryg is just getting
started and we have much to learn from Alka here.
Generally, the use of data and analytics is an area that we will beneﬁt and reap a lot of
beneﬁts from over the next coming years. However, on the product and services side, we
can see that our product oﬀering is much larger than what Tryg is and there we can sell
more products to the Alka members or the Alka customers. And lastly on component then
(15:39) you wouldn't ﬁnd in the normal cost ratio, but is a synergy for us; it's about 5% of
reinsuring and investment synergies where combining the two entities are going to give
us this beneﬁt. Bear in mind that there is a DKK 250 million transition cost that will aﬀect
our 2018 numbers.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to the next page, which is the funding page, as Morten has already mentioned,
the DKK 8.2 billion consists of DKK 2.5 billion excess capital in Alka that would be
released upon closing. The price paid is then DKK 5.7 billion and of that, we are raising
DKK 4 billion of equity, which has been fully underwritten by TryghedsGruppen at a
minimum price of DKK 146 guaranteed. Furthermore, to ﬁnance this transaction, we have
our Tier 1 capital issue that will be done during Q1 2018, and we have DKK 1.2 billion of
Tryg capital used for this transaction.
Trying to put – on the next page which is our solvency ratio and pro forma, again, trying to
give these moving parts a little bit of content, we have put a solvency ratio pro forma
based on Q3, 2017. How would our solvency ratio look if we apply all these numbers, and
it ends up at 170%. Now, bear in mind, once upon closure, these numbers will diﬀer to the
extent that time has passed and we will kind of get the ﬁnal numbers on all these
components.
I think that was on the ﬁnancial side. Morten, back to you to summarize.

Morten Hübbe
Thank you, Christian. And just lastly before we turn to Q&A on the last slide, we
summarize that we are extremely pleased with the news today. It is indeed a very rare
opportunity to be able to buy a high-quality business in our core Danish private lines area.
The economic value of the operations we're buying when you take out the excess capital
of DKK 2.5 billion is DKK 5.7 billion. Alka has rolling 12 months; now been delivering in
2017 technical result of DKK 325 million and we expect to deliver DKK 300 million of
synergies across Tryg and across Alka in 2021. This will be strongly accretive to our EPS
and it will strengthen our ability to grow our dividends in the future.
We very much look forward to welcoming the management and the employees of Alka
once we have completed and received approval. We very much look forward to

Page 5 of 17

welcoming the customers of Alka with strong propositions in the future, including the 8%
membership bonus, and then we very much look forward to continuing a Tryg journey of
long-term proﬁtable growth and very strong shareholder returns.

FINAL

And with that, we will turn to your questions.

Q&A
Operator
And the ﬁrst question is from Per Grønborg from SEB. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Per Grønborg
Yes. Good morning. A couple of questions from my side. First of all, one clariﬁcation; you
write gross premium was DKK 2.5 billion, all tables points to DKK 2.1 billion-something.
Can you elaborate on what the diﬀerence is? If it's life, what's the proﬁtability of what is on
the life business? That was my ﬁrst question.

Bloomberg Transcript

My second question is related to the DKK 2.5 billion you are taking out in excess capital
from Alka seems to leave the company with an equity to premium ratio of only 20%
assuming DKK 2.1 billion and not DKK 2.5 billion, that seems like a quite aggressive
gearing compared to where you're running your own business must imply that you could
run your own business with almost half the capital it has currently.
And my ﬁnal question on the goodwill, I guess part of that will end up as client intangibles
that needs to be amortized over a period of time. Can you elaborate a bit on how we
should expect that accounting treatment to turn up?

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

Good morning, Per.

Q - Per Grønborg
Good morning.

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

The DKK 2.5 billion to DKK 2.1 billion, the diﬀerence is the group life business that's there
and the life business is basically more or less a zero some gain with a collaboration with
the unions. So the DKK 2.1 billion is what you would ﬁnd as our non-life portion of the
business.
When it comes to the DKK 2.5 billion in excess capital release and the solvency ratios and
the premium ratios you are talking to, you have to bear in mind that this is a private line
business and when we look at our numbers and look at our private line business, it's very
comparable to the ones that we're using for Alka. So, you're right, if Tryg was an only
Page 6 of 17



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2017-12-04

private line business, we could be running our solvency at a diﬀerent level, but since we
have workers' comp and other corporate lines that does consume more capital per
premium, when you combine those things in Tryg, it is a higher solvency ratio.

FINAL

And on the goodwill part, could you just repeat the question? Sorry.

Q - Per Grønborg
The goodwill arising from this deal, I assume part of that will be classiﬁed as client
intangibles that needs to be amortized over a period of time, what sort of amortization
cost should we expect?

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

I think we'll revert to that at a later stage, Per, and give you more details once we have
kind of ﬁnalized and closed the deal.

Q - Per Grønborg
Okay. Can I just add one more? In your closing marks, you said that this deal will be
strongly accretive to EPS. In the release, you say that this would give high-single-digit
proﬁtable, or is that EPS growth?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

It is EPS growth. So, it is within the three years, so, we're saying 2018 will be sort of a
transitioning year. We'll get the authority approval, et cetera. 2021 will be year three of full
collaboration and ownership and in 2021, we will see a high-single-digit EPS accretion.

Q - Per Grønborg
Okay. Thank you.

Operator
And next question is from the line of Steven Haywood from HSBC. Please go ahead. Your
line is open.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Hello. Good morning. Can I just clarify that last statement quickly? Sorry. You say the
acquisition is initially earnings enhancing, is that on an EPS basis?

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. And then...

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

I'm saying it is slightly enhancing the ﬁrst full year and high-single digit in 2021.

FINAL

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

On a per share, that's good. Couple of other questions; the excess capital of DKK 2.5
billion that you removed from Alka, what would that drop the 360% Solvency II ratio to?
That's my ﬁrst question. And then the reserve – the buﬀer and reserves now triggers us I
think with a 7% buﬀer. What level does Alka reserve at? And then you also – and ﬁnally,
you mentioned that you grow – you aim to grow the dividend in the future. This deal is
supportive of that. Is there any change to your special dividend philosophy going
forward? Thank you.

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. So, the DKK 2.5 billion excess capital, you have to think of this as a
combined entity. So, we will not post the Alka solvency ratio post this. This is both
combined with a cash excess and also the capital synergies that we get from Tryg, that is
the total of the DKK 2.7 billion excess capital. When it comes to the reserving buﬀer, we
are not disclosing kind of like Alka's reserving buﬀer, but as I mentioned, during our due
diligence, it was very evident for us that the reserving practice at Alka is at a conservative
level, and even more conservative than Tryg has been working at.

Bloomberg Transcript

With respect to your last question which was...?

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

On the – any change in the special dividend.

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

So, thank you. Yes. Sorry, I didn't think – I didn't get to write that one down. I think you
have to bear in mind the way that we operate with our special dividend, it is at a year-end
consideration where we look at our capital position and our ﬁnancial forecast, and by
then, we will decide whether to dispute excess – extraordinary dividend.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

So there's no changes to our practice.

A - Morten Hübbe
I can just complement by saying that over the past 15 years that I've been in Tryg, we've
had a number of due diligence exercises, and it's fair to say that I've never previously seen
our actuaries being positive about anyone else's reserves, but they were in this case and
of course, that is very positive.

Operator
Our next question is from the line of Paul De'Ath from RBC. Please go ahead. Your line is
open.

Q - Paul De'Ath
Yeah. Hi, there. Just a couple of questions, please, more around the kind of brand and
growth aspects of the deal. So, eventually, how strong the Alka brand is relative to its size?
Are you intending on running the two brands in parallel going forward and how does that
work? Does that aﬀect anything in terms of the way the businesses have run?
And then the second (26:03) on that was, you also mentioned, you're conﬁdent that you
can continue to grow Alka's business going forward; does that have any impact on Tryg's
business? Where has Alka been growing in the last ﬁve or six years? Has that been
impacting Tryg's market share? Essentially, does two plus two equal four, or does it equal
three in terms of sales? Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hübbe
Thank you. Good morning to you as well. Yes, on the branded faction, it is our intention to
continue to use both brands. It is our expectation that it will be separate products,
separate prices. The unions have special agreements. Those special agreements will
continue. There is, of course, a strong link between the high brand awareness and the
sales methodology and the cost of sales because what we're seeing in the Alka business
model is that they have reduced the cost of sales signiﬁcantly amongst others, the 36%
online sales, which is extremely high in a Danish market context and of course, the high
brand awareness creates a pool impact of customers contacting the company.
And as such, there is a very strong value creation in continuing the Alka brand, continuing
the products and the pricing and continuing the cooperation with the unions and that is
very much a part of the transaction and the agreement.
When it comes to your second question on growth and how that relates to Tryg, we can
see that over time, Tryg has lost, net, some customers to Alka every year, but to be honest,
that is not a large number and it's not – Tryg customers has not been the main source of
Alka customers at all. So, the overlap or cannibalization, if you will, has been quite small.
So generally, Alka has been active in the entire Danish market and not speciﬁcally towards
Tryg. And then of course, you should bear in mind that we expect that the 8%
membership bonus will gradually grow in awareness in the Danish market, and that that
will, over the next four, ﬁve years, beneﬁt both the Tryg private lines customers,
commercial customers, corporate customers, and now in the future also, the Alka
customers. And of course, that will strengthen the value proposition of Alka which is
already attractive in the Danish market.

Operator
Next question is from the line of Asbjørn Mørk from Danske Bank. Please go ahead. Your
line is open.

Q - Asbjørn Nicholas Mørk
Yes. Good morning from my side. Just two questions really. First on the excess capital
DKK 2.5 billion, just to clarify, will that capital be freed up more or less from day one or is
that sort of a transitional phase here?
The second one, relating to your rating, so I guess your solvency ratio will increase quite a
lot the next couple of quarters before the transaction goes through because you take on
the equity, but the 170% solvency pro forma, I guess that leaves the risk on your ratings. Is
that factored into your synergies of DKK 300 million per year or what impact do you
expect from this? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

Good morning, Asbjørn. So, to the excess capital, yes, it will be once upon closing that we
will release this DKK 2.5 billion, so that will come up and be freed up more or less at
closing. With respect to the rating, we don't – we have had a discussion with Moody's and
given them all the material needed. We don't expect any signiﬁcant changes. If we are
having any changes, bear in mind that not too long ago we actually had a notch up from
Moody's and has not really given us some impact on the business overall. So, you could
argue that it is included in the DKK 300 million synergies, but we expect very low impact
by any kind of rating changes.

Okay. Thank you.

Company Name: Tryg A/S

Q - Per Grønborg

FINAL

Yes. I have a few other things. You're addressing the high brand awareness of Alka; it's
pretty obvious that Alka has probably had a marketing spend that was way above what
Tryg had. Is that part of the synergies? Taking away that marketing spend in that case, how
much are we talking about?
My second one is, the synergies you will take into account, is that including a head-oﬃce
relocation? That was my two additional questions.

A - Morten Hübbe
Yeah. Thank you, Per. It's nice to see that you're awake twice this morning. No. On the
brand awareness, to be serious, we expect – you're right, Alka has a very high brand
spend. They will continue to have a very high brand spend in the future because we see
that, again, it's a combination of cost of sales and branding spend. I think that once we
have had closing oﬀ of the transaction, of course, we will do some changes to branding
spend, but you should expect that we will continue a higher branding spend on Alka
because combined with the very, very low cost of sale and a 36% online sale, the totality
of those two is extremely attractive.

Bloomberg Transcript

And there's no doubt that we are not planning to just return to a traditional Tryg model
where our branding spend is lower, but then our cost of sale is signiﬁcantly higher. So,
some adjustments you should expect Per, and some of that would also ﬂow into the
synergies, but you shouldn't expect revolution on the branding spend.
Then on the head oﬃce, on the other hand, it's quite clear that Alka's employees in
Denmark are positioned in three diﬀerent locations. They are positioned in Taastrup in
Copenhagen area and also in Aarhus and Kolding (33:21). In all three of those locations,
we expect that they will be a relocation. It will happen expectedly in 2019 on all three
locations and of course, that will both do something for the culture and also do
something for the cost.

Q - Per Grønborg
Okay. Can I add one more question? When I look at the pricing of the products of these
two companies, I just take up my own house, your price is 35% more expensive than
Alka's price. You are buying a mid-to-low-end priced company. Your own company is
priced typically at the upper end of the price range. Now, the content of these products,
will it be the same? Don't you feel that there will be a cannibalization that the people will
take the cheap Alka product knowing that there is Tryg quality behind, which some might
have a bit some uncertainty about yesterday?

A - Morten Hübbe
I think ﬁrst of all, Per, it is completely clear that there is a lot of diﬀerence on prices, there
is a lot of diﬀerences on products, and there is a lot of diﬀerence on process. There will
continue to be a lot of diﬀerences on all three. Alka products will not become Tryg
products. We will continue to drive this as two separate market positionings, and
therefore, you will continue to see the same diﬀerence in the future. What you will, of

course, add to the equation is a membership bonus which our 60% shareholder is paying
for. Of course that will strengthen the Alka equation. But there's no doubt – and that is
one of the reasons why we will continue to have two brands and to a large extent, two
separate parts of the organization with separate focuses.
That is also today, if you look at Tryg's current business with the unions, the unions'
business within Tryg is a separate organization that has other prices and other products
and another business model to the broader private lines Tryg Denmark business. And
similarly, that will continue for Alka as well. So, very separate proﬁle, separate products,
separate prices and, therefore, I'm not worried about the challenge you're mentioning.

Hi. Two questions from me. Just on capital, I just want to check that the slide 14 roll
forward (36:01) supersedes the Capital Markets Day. One, i.e., no more IT investments,
and then it looks like the partial internal model approval is dropped oﬀ.
And then, the second question what – can you tell us what reserve releases we're running
out at the nine months for Alka? And a bit of color around what the reserve addition was
in 2016? Thank you very much.

A - Morten Hübbe
Good morning, Robert. With respect to the solvency ratio pro forma, I think when we've
mentioned at the Capital Markets Day that we're working on internal model you can see
the second bar being internal model for Danish workers' comp is the one that has been
approved. Now, the continuous work on our model is something that will come in the
future. So, we haven't taken all the components in. And also, as you mentioned, the IT
spend that will come in 2020; this is more a pro forma of what this transaction does to us
now.
With respect to the other question...

Q - Robert Rampton

{BIO 20079733 <GO>}

Okay, so just on that...

A - Morten Hübbe
What's – go ahead, sorry.

Q - Robert Rampton

{BIO 20079733 <GO>}

Okay. So, both – we can still expect both the IT and the continued optimization?

FINAL

A - Morten Hübbe
Yes. That is correct. And your second question was on the run-oﬀ levels. The run-oﬀ levels
for Alka in 2016 was somewhat lower than average. It's been around 8% over this last ﬁveyear period. I think that we expect the run-oﬀ levels of Alka to go down to levels of Tryg
bringing the ﬂeet to (37:29) 5% in long term. So, that's what's been contributing their
performance over the last ﬁve years.

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

It is fair to say that that – given that the reserving position of Alka is slightly more
conservative than Tryg's, we're quite comfortable with that, but we're trying not to be too
positive in our outlook on future run-oﬀs. So, we've taken a conservative stance. So, what
you can actually see when you do the math is that we have assumed that run rate (38:05)
combined ratio increases, assuming more conservative run-oﬀs, and then we improve it
again with the synergies. That is the math we've done.

And next question is a follow-up from Steven Haywood from HSBC. Please go ahead. Your
line is open.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Thank you. Thanks for taking my next question. The pro forma 170% solvency II ratio, is this
level quite comfortable for you? And looking at your history and you've previously given
the solvency II ratio in a standard formula, could you provide some information here?
Would it be around the 130% level on a standard formula? Thank you.

A - Morten Hübbe
Well, I'll kick oﬀ, Steven, we're showing the 170%, which we think is fully comfortable given
our business model and the transaction we've now done. But you should bear in mind
that prior to this transaction, we have given no guidance as to target range of solvency in
the future, and we're not starting to give guidance on solvency ranges in the future either.
For us, it's quite clear that our important drivers are on the earnings targets including the
targets for return on equity, and then we have our dividend policy and our track record of
high capital repatriation. So, no further guidance than we're (39:47) comfortable at the
170% we're showing here.
And with respect to your second question on the standard formula, I can see that Gian,
he'll get back to you on those numbers to give you the details, Steven.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Thank you. I just wanted to clarify one more question regarding – most of mine were
answered, but the accretion of the new – is after the new shares of course. And ﬁnally,
there was some noise during the weekend from a lot of stuﬀ in the local press. I just
wanted to conﬁrm or hear your thoughts on those noises as you have acquired Alka.
Thank you.

A - Morten Hübbe
Good morning to you as well, Jan Erik. Yes. The EPS accretion is of course the net impact
of the new shares issued and the change through to earnings so that is completely
correct. You're correct that there has been some noise in the local papers during last
week and over the weekend, and I guess it's fair to say that when you change a company
from being owned by unions to no longer being owned by the unions, then there's a lot
of – of course getting used to what does that mean and how does that potentially impact
the unions. We're quite clear that the oﬀerings with union members until now has been
very strong, and the customer satisfaction has been extremely high.
The growth and the results have been strong. We are continuing exactly the same
membership beneﬁts for the union members. So, there's no deterioration on that, and
then of course our 60% shareholders adding the 8% membership bonus in addition. So, I
think once everyone has gotten used to that there has been a change, I think what we'll
be seeing is that the new oﬀering is actually the same or if anything slightly stronger than
the old oﬀering.

So, I think that will be positive to the customers and the union members. And there's no
doubt that that has been a very important part of the choice also on the unions when
choosing whom to sell this company to, that they saw a strong commitment on our side,
and they saw a strong DNA relationship, our strong experience with unions through 75
years, our giving back to society through our main shareholder and the 8% bonus. So, I
think that will come down during the coming period.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay. Just two very quickly, on the life side and the capital it's use (43:15), is it so that
there is no risk for Tryg shareholders at any (43:20) stage because this is covered by sort
of 100% combined ratio scheme for the union members or is it anything and capital at risk
on the life side even though it's a very small part of it?

A - Morten Hübbe
There is no signiﬁcant impact on the risk proﬁle of Tryg given the small portfolio of life. It
is a very – currently a very proﬁtable portfolio that where there is a – as mentioned, a
combined ratio of 100 sharing between the unions and Tryg in the future. So, no
signiﬁcant change in the risk proﬁle.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. And ﬁnally then, who approached who in this transaction, is it so, that you we're
approached by Alka or did you approach them?

A - Morten Hübbe
I think what you can read from the press, of course, we are well informed of our own
process, but what you can read from the press is that it was an initiative taken by the
company and the seller. And therefore, they approached us.

Your line is open.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Good morning. Hi. Sorry, just one question I had was a few years ago when there was a lot
of pricing competition from the likes of Alka, I don't think it was that complementary
about the reserving and pricing practices. So, I just wanted to understand, why your view
is diﬀerent today? Have they changed something?
And then just one follow-up is that, what was the motivation for Alka to seek a buyer, I
mean, if everything was going so strongly, what could drive them the solvency goals were

not very easy thereby (45:17)? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Christian Baltzer

{BIO 19705595 <GO>}

Good morning, Vinit. You always have a good memory of what has happened in the past.
I think that when you look outside in on a (45:29) company, you kind of – and you see
them performing, as Morten mentioned, with strong combined ratio and strong growth,
you kind of get – trying to ﬁnd out what is actually driving this. But during our due
diligence, we have found that it's a strong focus on pricing, it's a strong focus on just
performing on – with the portfolio constantly, which basically giving them the ability to
keep their – maintain their low prices and maintain a high proﬁtability. So, once we've
been under the hood and see if the engine is actually a well-oiled engine that we are
absorbing into Tryg, which we're really looking forward to learn a lot from.

A - Morten Hübbe

Bloomberg Transcript

I'll just complement what Christian said. I think it's fair to say, Vinit, that from the outside,
strong competitors with low pricing is now the – of course, that is challenging for
everyone, so we have mentioned that in the past. I'm quite sure we have never mentioned
anything about Alka's reserves. So, I think that is your interpretation, not something we've
ever said.
And then when it comes to the motive of the unions, it's quite clear that that it is very
important for the unions to have strong value creation for their members, so they get
oﬀers and propositions that are unique to their members and that is an advantage to the
members. Therefore, it has been very important for the unions and the negotiations to
secure that that will continue in the future and even be strengthened further with the
membership bonus.
So what has also been clear as to the motive is that there's really no reason why the
unions would have to own the company to have those advantages. And it is a very, very
signiﬁcant value concentration for the unions to have so high asset value in one speciﬁc
company. And that has been the main motivation.
