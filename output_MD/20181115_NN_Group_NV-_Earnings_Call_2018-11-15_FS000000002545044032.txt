nothing in today's comments constitutes an oﬀer to sell or a solicitation of an oﬀer to buy
any securities.
Good morning, Mr. Friese, over to you.

FINAL

Eilard Friese
Thank you, operator. Good morning everybody and welcome to this third quarter analyst
call. I will start today's presentation by talking about the highlights of the third quarter
results and the business developments in the past quarter. Delﬁn Rueda, our Chief
Financial Oﬃcer, will then take you through the details of the ﬁnancial performance and
talk about the free cash ﬂow and capital position. After wrapping up the presentation, I
will open the call for Q&A and Jan-Hendrik Erasmus, our Chief Risk Oﬃcer, is also with us
today to answer your questions.

Bloomberg Transcript

So let's move to slide number 3, the highlights. NN Group's operating result of the
ongoing business for the third quarter of 2018 was €463 million, which is up 7% compared
with the same quarter last year. The higher operating result was driven by improved
underwriting performance at Netherlands Non-life in both the disability and accident and
the property and casualty books as well as €48 million of private equity and special
dividends at Netherlands Life. Lower expenses also contributed to the increase, as we
have continued to extract the synergy beneﬁts from integrating Delta Lloyd.
We achieved further cost savings of €33 million this quarter, bringing the total cost
reductions in the business units in the scope of the integration to €269 million compared
with the full-year 2016 expense base. We are therefore progressing well towards our
target of €400 million by the end of 2020.
In terms of commercial performance, total new sales in the third quarter amounted to
€328 million, down 14% at the same period last year. This was mainly due to increased
competition in the COLI market in Japan as well as lower volume of group pension
contracts up for renewal in the Netherlands Life, which as you know are skewed to the ﬁrst
quarter of the year.
Our balance sheet and capital position remain strong. NN Group's solvency ratio at the
end of the third quarter was 239%, up from 226% at the end of the second quarter of
2018, reﬂecting operating capital generation and positive market impacts. Free cash ﬂow
to the holding company was €293 million, bringing the cash capital of the holding to €1.9
billion at the end of the third quarter.
Let's move to slide number 4. Our ambition is to be a company that truly matters in the
lives of our stakeholders. For our customers, this means developing innovative solutions
and value-added products that meet their needs.
Let me give you some examples of how we're doing this across our businesses. NN Bank
has recently launched mortgage products speciﬁcally geared to the needs of senior
citizens and for expatriates wanting to settle in the Netherlands. A new accidental health

insurance is being sold online in Poland and is a unique solution for children covering a
broad range of accidents and care assistance.

FINAL

We also look for ways to enhance the customer experience. For example, our non-life
business in Belgium has a service called My Advisor@Home whereby an advisor is
available within 24 hours to assess the damage and who takes care of all the necessary
arrangements and repairs throughout the claims handling process.
Our asset manager NN Investment Partners uses partnerships to support its growth
ambitions and to reach customers through new channels, for example in Japan where NN
IP and Rakuten Securities have announced a new investment service for retail investors.

Bloomberg Transcript

We take our social and environmental responsibilities seriously. ESG factors are
embedded in our investment process and we are also incorporating these in our
products. BeFrank is the ﬁrst pension provider to introduce a Sustainable Impact
Dashboard which allows employees of pension schemes to monitor the impact of their
contributions on waste production, water consumption and CO2 emissions.
Let's now turn to slide 5. As you know, we have a target to reduce the administrative
expense base for the business units in scope of the integration by €400 million by the
end of 2020, of which at least half by the end of 2018. The integration of Delta Lloyd is
progressing well. So far we have reduced expenses by a total of €269 million compared
with the 2016 expense base. Looking ahead, we will continue to drive eﬃciency
throughout the organization. However, please bear in mind that the expense reduction
will not always be linear from quarter to quarter and some units may at times see expense
increases to support growth and make the necessary investments.
We have submitted the application to include Delta Lloyd Life and Non-life in our partial
internal model and we are on track to have this expanded partial internal model
approved by the end of this year. This will allow us to complete the legal merges of the
Dutch Life and Non-life (00:06:25) entities in 2019 as planned.
I will now hand you over to Delﬁn Rueda. Delﬁn, over to you.

[06F1LR-E Delﬁn Arroyo]
Thank you, Lard, and good morning, everyone. Let me start with NN Group's third quarter
operating results of the ongoing business which was 7% on last year at €463 million. This
increase was driven by an improved underwriting performance at Netherlands Non-life
and higher dividends at Netherlands Life as well as a reduction in administrative
expenses. This was partly oﬀset by a lower technical margin at Netherlands Life as well as
lower operating results at Insurance Europe and segment Other mainly due to
nonrecurring beneﬁts in the third quarter of 2017.
The net result of €788 million represent an increase of 7% on last year. In addition to the
higher operating result this quarter, we also recognize an additional divestment result of
€56 million related to the sale of ING Life Korea.

Moving on to slide 8, I will take you through the third quarter performance of the
individual segments. Starting as usual with our largest segment, Netherlands Life posted a
higher operating result supported by €48 million of private equity and special dividends
as well as lower administrative expenses.

FINAL

This was partly oﬀset by a lower technical margin as last year included some nonrecurring
beneﬁts and favorable mortality experience variances.
The operating result of Netherlands Non-life increased to €46 million versus €1 million a
year ago, reﬂecting an improved underwriting performance in both disability and
accident and property and casualty and also lower administrative expenses.
The current quarter also beneﬁted from favorable claims experience and a €5 million
private equity dividend. It is encouraging to see that both D&A and P&C reported a
combined ratio below 100% this quarter, with the total combined ratio coming to 97.1%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Needless to say that the claims experience is volatile from quarter to quarter and that we
will continue to implement measures to structurally reduce the combined ratio to 97% or
below.
At Insurance Europe, the lower operating result reﬂects a lower investment margin and €5
million of nonrecurring beneﬁts related to the Life business in Greece in the third quarter
last year. The lower operating result at Japan Life was mainly due to higher DAC
amortization on surrenders, which was partly oﬀset by higher fees and premium-based
revenues driven by higher in-force volumes.
The operating result of Asset Management of €43 million was due to lower fees, partly
compensated by expense reductions.
Finally, the operating result of the segment Other was €28 million versus €41 million last
year, which included a total of €38 million of nonrecurring beneﬁts compared with €14
million in the current quarter. This quarter also reﬂects higher results at the reinsurance
business. On the other hand, the banking business saw continued pressure on the interest
margin partly compensated by lower administrative expenses.
Moving now to the next slide which shows our cash capital position. The holding
company cash capital increased to €1.9 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2018 from
€1.8 billion at the end of the second quarter. The free cash ﬂow during the third quarter
was €293 million driven by €338 million of dividends received from subsidiaries. This was
partly oﬀset by €193 million of capital ﬂow to shareholders, representing the cash part of
the 2018 interim dividend of €127 million and share repurchase in the current quarter for
an amount of €66 million.
As always, details of the dividends upstreamed by segment can be found in the Appendix
of this presentation.

FINAL

To ﬁnalize my presentation, I will take you through the developments in NN Group's
solvency on slide 10, starting with the movement for the quarter. Our Solvency II ratio
increased to 239% at the end of the third quarter, up from 226% at the end of the
previous quarter. Operating capital generation and market impacts each added 7
percentage points to the ratio this quarter.
Markets had a positive impact to Own Funds mainly driven by the widening of peripheral
government bond spreads to which we are underweight compared to the reference
portfolio. Real estate revaluations and higher interest rates also contributed positively to
the ratio.
I will ﬁnish oﬀ by mentioning a couple of other items that may be relevant. Firstly, let me
remind you that the 2018 interim dividend paid in September was already deducted from
the Solvency II ratio at the end of the second quarter. Furthermore, as Lard mentioned, we
are on track to get approval for including the main Dutch Delta Lloyd entities in the partial
internal model by the end of this year. These will be taken into account in our solvency
ratio when approved.
And lastly, we currently expect that the proposed corporate tax rate reduction in the
Netherlands will have a negative upfront impact on our Solvency II ratio if and when
enacted. Economically, of course, this will be positive, resulting in higher capital
generation and proﬁts over time.

Bloomberg Transcript

And with that, I pass you back to Lard for the wrap-up.

Eilard Friese
Thanks, Delﬁn. NN Group has delivered another solid set of results for the third quarter of
2018, posting (00:13:12) an increase of 7% on the same quarter last year with Netherlands
Life and Netherlands Non-life reporting higher operating results. The integration of Delta
Lloyd continues to progress well. Total expense reductions to date amount to €269 million
as we continue to extract the synergies of the integration and drive eﬃciency throughout
the organization.
Our balance sheet remains strong with a cash capital position of €1.9 billion and a
Solvency II ratio of 239% at the end of the third quarter. We are on track to have the
expanded partial internal model approved by the end of this year and to complete the
legal merges of Dutch life and non-life (00:13:51) entities in 2019 as planned.
This quarter's performance conﬁrms that we are progressing well in executing our
strategy which focuses on successfully integrating Delta Lloyd, further improving the
operating performance of all of our segments, accelerating the transformation of the
business model and continuing to allocate capital rationally.
Now before we go into Q&A, let me just mention the second press release that we issued
this morning in which we announced the termination of the warrant agreement with ING
for a consideration of €76 million. As you are aware, NN and ING entered into this warrant
Page 5 of 23

agreement at the time of the IPO in 2014. We are pleased to have completed this
transaction as it eliminates a potential share dilution.
I will now open the call for your questions and hand over to the operator.

FINAL

Q&A
Operator
Thank you, Mr. Friese. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now start the question-and-answersession. The ﬁrst question is from Mr. Cor Kluis, ABN AMRO. Go ahead please, sir.

Q - Cor Kluis

{BIO 3515446 <GO>}

Good morning. Cor Kluis, ABN AMRO and congratulations by the way with solving the
warrant for this (00:15:25). Further couple of questions, ﬁrst of all on the bank, could you
give somewhat more clarity about the dividend upstreaming from the bank going forward
taking into account that the capital consumption of the growth of the bank is not so large
anymore because year-to-date the mortgage book has been quite ﬂattish.

Bloomberg Transcript

So what can we expect from dividend, yeah (00:15:49), payments from next year
onwards? And also maybe related to that, what might be the Basel IV impact on a fullydiluted basis for the bank? It will be not much probably because you already extended
formula but could you (00:16:00), an indication how the 16.4% CET1 ratio might change as
a result of Basel IV?
And my second question is about Solvency II. Could you give a little bit more clarity about
the fact that in the fourth quarter, you highlighted about the corporate tax rate eﬀect.
What percentage eﬀect could that be on the Solvency II ratio? And Delta Lloyd to the
partial internal model in the fourth quarter, what that might be or could that maybe
compensate the corporate tax eﬀect? And if you might have done some or thinking about
some reinsurance deals in the fourth quarter and what the market eﬀects might be in the
Solvency II in the fourth quarter? Those were my questions.

A - Eilard Friese
Yeah. Thank you, Cor. So I'm going to hand over to Delﬁn actually for both questions. So
Delﬁn, the bank and Solvency II.

A - Delﬁn Rueda Arroyo

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Thank you, Cor. So you're right that the bank has already found a level of proﬁtability and
return on equity that allows them to fund their own growth and in addition to that to
contribute further to dividends going forward.
So they started with a small dividend in the last quarter in Q2 of €8 million and we will
expect that depending on their proﬁtability and evolution on the Solvency (00:17:31), this
will continue to be the case. But you have to of course assume that these are going to be
Page 6 of 23



Company Name: NN Group NV

Date: 2018-11-15

FINAL

relatively moderate dividends coming from the bank going forward. It's well-capitalized as
you said with a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 16.4%, and you are also (00:17:50)
absolutely right that Basel IV won't have a material impact on that.
On your question on Solvency II on the corporate tax rate reduction ﬁrst. Maybe a caveat
to mention that still this has not been approved by the Dutch Parliament but we do expect
that the changes in the corporate tax are going to come through. And if we were to look
at the impact that the current proposal of corporate tax reduction will have on our
Solvency II ratio, it will be around 10 percentage points, okay, but also very important to
indicate that this is obviously a positive aspect in terms of the contribution to the net proﬁt
and the capital generation going forward.
Obviously, that will depend also at the level of the solvency ratio. That is very sensitive to
the level of the solvency ratio when these taxes are going to be implemented as it aﬀects
mainly the solvency capital requirement due to the reduction on the EBITDA (00:19:05).
In terms of the beam (00:19:08), as we have mentioned in the past, we continue in the
process. We do expect to have approval before year-end. So, we are doing everything on
our hands to get into this goal. And don't forget that there is a beneﬁt that is currently in
place on the standard formula, on the calculation of the SCR under the standard formula
for Delta Lloyd Life. And that beneﬁt at the end of last year was €350 million will be lost.
That's why we have said that there's going to be – we spent maybe a net positive at a
moderate impact due to the introduction of the PIM.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Cor Kluis

{BIO 3515446 <GO>}

And the market FX in the fourth quarter?

A - Delﬁn Rueda Arroyo

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Market during the fourth quarter was 7 percentage points. The main impacts were due to
the reduction on the spreads of government bonds, particularly, peripheral bonds. But
also, we beneﬁted for revaluation of equity and real estate.

Q - Cor Kluis

{BIO 3515446 <GO>}

And maybe just to add, the impact of the movements quarter-to-date have been broadly
neutral on our solvency ratio.

A - Jan-Hendrik Erasmus

{BIO 19801435 <GO>}

Okay. Okay. (00:20:35) Thank you very much.

Operator
The next question is from Mr. Ashik Musaddi, JPMorgan. Go ahead please.

FINAL

(00:20:43-00:20:52) what are you thinking about M&A at this point? I mean, clearly, there
are few opportunities at the moment in Belgium and in Holland, and those are not that
big M&As as well. We are talking about €300 million, €400 million. So, can you share
some thoughts about what you're thinking, and how you're positioned for those potential
deals? Any thoughts on that? Would you be considering, not considering? So that's the
ﬁrst one.
Second question is with respect to debt. I mean, one of the investor concerns on NN
Group is around your high leverage. I mean, the way we look at high leverage is your
Solvency II is fully (00:21:28), and even on IFRS basis, look a bit high. So, I mean, what can
you potentially do to reduce your leverage ratio? Would that be a hurdle to do any sort of
buybacks early next year? Any thoughts on that would be great.
And then, last thing, the last question would be around your Solvency II capital
generation. I mean, this year, for ﬁrst nine months, you have generated around 36%, 39%
capital, or 40% capital? And that, too, is net of dividends. So, how should we think about –
what really worked this year, basically? Why is the capital generation so high? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Eilard Friese
Okay, Ashik. Thanks for your questions. I'm going to take the ﬁrst one on M&A, and then
Delﬁn will talk about the leverage and about the capital generation rate. So, ﬁrst on the
M&A, if we have an opportunity to strengthen our business, we will look at it and evaluate
it carefully. And if it makes sense and it complies with the ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial
criteria that we have for this, then we will look at it, and we will transact. The same thing –
it happened with Delta Lloyd at that time. We've also, last quarter, announced two smaller
transactions at the Czech and Slovak Republics.
Our priority is in markets where we already have a presence. Because we believe that you
understand the business that you would acquire, and you can extract synergetic beneﬁts
and increased scale in the markets that you're present. We would evaluate opportunities
in the Netherlands, but also outside of the Netherlands in markets, where we already have
our presence. But please note in the Netherlands, our priority is obviously the integration
of Delta Lloyd and extracting the full value of that. But if we can strengthen the business
further, we will look at that.
Delﬁn, over to you.

A - Delﬁn Rueda Arroyo

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you. Ashik. Let me, for a moment, disagree on your assessment that there is a
high level of leverage. We are certainly very comfortable with the level of debt. If you look
at our ﬁxed charge coverage ratio of close to 15 times in this quarter for the last 12 month,
we calculated always on a last 12-month basis, that is certainly quite coverage of the
interest expense.
Also, taking into account that NN Group is especially cash-generative in relation to the the
IFRS reserves. The fact that the majority of the operating result convert to actual cash to
Page 8 of 23



Company Name: NN Group NV
Company Ticker: NN NA Equity
Date: 2018-11-15

FINAL

the holding company in terms of EBITDA, basically gives you an actual interest cover,
which is very high. If you combine that with the fact that the cost of debt is relatively cheap
at this point of time and the fact that we have a very high level of ﬁnancial ﬂexibility due to
our solvency, the level of cash capital upholding, I don't think that the level of debt can be
categorized as being high or of any concern, which that answers with regard your
question in terms of any plans in terms of reducing the level of debt, we currently don't
have. I think that we are comfortable with the current debt structure.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Thanks, Delﬁn. What you're saying, if I understand it correctly, is it fair to say that leverage
will not be constraint if you were to consider doing the share buyback?

A - Delﬁn Rueda Arroyo

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes. So, leverage is not a constraint for the fourth quarter.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Delﬁn Rueda Arroyo

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Then in terms of the Solvency II capital generation, you're right. In the nine months up to
September, we have had a very positive growth of – the solvency ratio increased by 40
basis points. 17 percentage points was related to operating return. And we have a very
good positive impact related to market. But I think that if you were to look back to the
time since the introduction, because markets are always – can be volatile, can be positive
or negative. And we have gone through a period of relatively positive impact.
But if you were to look at from the start of the introduction of Solvency II, we have actually
in this, I think, 11 quarters, operating returns increased by 52 percentage points, where
markets only contributed 22 percentage points. So, it will come up or down, but it's a
measure, or if you were to look at it at NN Group in the current form, which is after the
acquisition of Delta Lloyd from the second quarter of 2017, basically, we also have 43
percentage points increase in the capital generation, of which, 29 percentage points, the
majority of it came from the operating return with only 21% coming from market. So, the
explanation this quarter is a strong operating capital generation, but also positive impact
on markets, as you mentioned.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Thanks. That's very clear. Thanks a lot.

FINAL

Hello. Thank you very much. I only got one question really. Are there any important
actions that are awaiting the legal entity mergers next year before they can be executed?
So, I'm kind of thinking in terms of where you are with the Delta Lloyd operational
integration process, is there any operational action has to await legal entities?
Your expense eﬃciencies so far have been running incredibly well, but I wonder if there's
going to be the need to increase the investments once the legal entities emerged. And
also, I don't know if any capital management decisions that you may make have the legal
entity mergers to precondition. Thank you.

A - Eilard Friese
Yeah, thanks Will. As we've said before that our objective is to merge the legal entities of
the large Life and Non-Life businesses in the Netherlands in 2019. There's a lot of things
that need to happen for that. We are working toward that.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, as Delﬁn already mentioned, I mentioned in my script on the slides, Partial Internal
Model approval and expansion, I think is an important step in that. Of course, we need to
obtain a Declaration of No Objection from our regulator for those legal entity mergers.
And there's a number of other steps that we need to do. Now, operationally, we are
progressing well, and the operational integration itself is not, let's say, a factor that would
be hampering the legal entity or mergers. So, in that sense, we're on track.
When it comes to the expense reductions, we are very pleased to see that we're now at
€269 million of expense reductions and well on our way of the €400 million target by the
end of 2020. And we do need to be mindful though, and we're very pleased, and I
compliment my teams for doing so. Having said that, we do need to caution that we're
now entering into the complex part of the integration process, which is all to do with
migrating portfolios into technology platforms of companies that have been in existence
for a very long time. So, I would be a bit careful to just look at the extrapolation of the past
quarters and take the same speed for the cost reductions.
So, while we're conﬁdent that we will get to the €400 million to the end of 2020, you
should be careful just extrapolating as a proxy the speed at which we did that over the last
couple of quarters. Also, indeed, it may be volatile in that sense in the quarters over time,
because you do need to invest also to get to the underlying expense reductions in
technology for instance. But so far, I must say, we're well underway.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

And just on the other parts of that question, with regards to how you manage capital. Is
the legal entity separation at the moment and then integration at all relevant to how you
think about capital management, or is it just a sort of ticking the box irrelevant to how
you're managing the group as a whole?

A - Eilard Friese
The main beneﬁt of managing in – if the legal entity are merged, the main beneﬁt that we
have for that is operational. And in governance, it just simpliﬁes Life in that sense, which I
Page 10 of 23

think is helpful, and that's the main beneﬁt of it.

Q - William Hawkins

Very clear. Thank you, Lard.

Operator
The next question is from Mr. Matthias de Wit, Kempen. Go ahead, please.

Q - Matthias de Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. I have three questions, please. The ﬁrst is on the capital generation.
Again, maybe I could come back on that. The €0.3 billion (00:31:04-00:31:08) in there.
And just linked to that, to what extent are the cost savings already captured in that
number? It's not entirely clear because some of them are reﬂected upfront in the best
estimates at least for the Life business, that's mostly the case.
And then, secondly, on the capital ratio of the Dutch Life entity. Wonder if you could
provide a pro forma for the merged entity including the impact of the legal merger? And
is there any target you have in mind for managing the Dutch entity going forward? Thank
you.

A - Eilard Friese

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Thank you, Matthias. Delﬁn, can I hand over to you, please.

A - Delﬁn Rueda Arroyo

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Thanks, Mathias. The question on the capital generation, the approximately €300 million,
no, it's not rounded up, is actually slightly up. In terms of the cost savings already
captured in the operating capital generation, you're right; it depends. Everything that is
related to savings in the Life business and also the long-term Non-Life part, as long as it
was already reﬂected in the assumptions, do not have an additional beneﬁt. Any
deviation, meaning, if cost savings are larger than what is assumed on those assumptions,
then they will be reﬂected when the assumptions are reset. However, if for both the shortterm in Non-Life business, as well as the other areas, the holding, the asset management,
the bank, Belgium, to a large extent, that they are being reﬂected as they are being
generated.
In terms of the pro forma of the merged entities in the Netherlands, it will be a simple
add-on of the Own Funds and the SCR of both entities will come to 235% solvency ratio.
And we have not set any particular target, but you have seen that the dividends are
coming out from Netherlands Life increased from usually €150 million per quarter, it
increased at €175 million. Obviously, the level of solvency is high. And as we have said,
this is our priority to maintain a stable payment from the subsidiaries. Always with the aim
to, over time, release some of this surplus capital in the diﬀerent legal entities.

FINAL

A - Eilard Friese
I hope it was clear. Just to make sure there's no misunderstandings, to your point, the
€0.3 billion, as Delﬁn indicated, is slightly rounded down and not rounded up. So, it's in

Bloomberg Transcript

Oh, hi there. Thank you very much. On the market movements, can you explain what the
percentage point impact was from real estate revaluations? And remind us what's going
on there, and what could continue to happen going forward?
Secondly, on capital management, in your answer to Will's question, I mean, there is a
dependence isn't there? Because if you merge entities, you said that you will reduce your
cash target at the holding. So, just wondering, what your latest thoughts are on that, and if
you could give us any guidance.
And lastly, just on again, the question on operational capital generation, at what point are
you going to feel conﬁdent in giving us kind of a vision of what you see as a regular,
smooth capital generation number every quarter? Because obviously, kind of a lot of your
peers do that. So, I'm just wondering cheekily whether you would be willing to say, Lard,
this is it. Thank you.

A - Eilard Friese
Yeah. So, on the ﬁrst and the third question, Delﬁn, but it's maybe also good to give JanHendrik an opportunity. So, can you do the second question about the capital
management dependence for the merger of legal entities, et cetera?

A - Jan-Hendrik Erasmus

{BIO 19801435 <GO>}

Yeah. Hi, Farooq. You're right to refer to the 1 in 20 (00:35:44) requirement, but at the
moment you see the solvency of both the legal entities in the Netherlands, the Life
entities, is very strong. So, at the moment that 1 in 20 stretch (00:35:55) requirement is
not having a big impact in this, so therefore, also not have a big dependency here for the
legal merger.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

But just going back on that, I think you did say that you would give the new target for the
holding cash if that happened. So, you're saying that's already happened?

FINAL

A - Jan-Hendrik Erasmus

{BIO 19801435 <GO>}

We are going to stick to our guidance on the target cash capital. I mean, the range of €0.5
billion to €1.5 billion remains the range. What we said is that we might be comfortable at
diﬀerent parts of that range through time. But certainly, the range of €0.5 billion to €1.5
billion is something we plan to leave unchanged.

A - Eilard Friese
And with that, Farooq, I'd like to hand over to Delﬁn for the other questions you had
about market movements and the potential run rate numbers.

A - Delﬁn Rueda Arroyo

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Thank you very much, Farooq. Real estate revaluations in the quarter represented a
little bit more than 1 percentage point on the market movement. What to expect going
forward, impossible to say. It is very much dependent on what is going to be the valuation
of real estate, particularly commercial real estate going forward.
On the range for the cost capital at holding, already Jan-Hendrik explained clearly that we
will maintain that range between the €0.5 billion and €1.5 billion. And in relationship to
our run rate of operating capital generation, as you know, it's relatively diﬃcult to say,
although by now, you have already got, I think, 11 quarters of operating capital generation
and you have seen what is the evolution. And when I look in this capital generation,
there's been around the €0.3 billion, around the €300 million over the last quarters.
On capital generation, you know that we have also beneﬁted from regular release on the
solvency capital requirement, which obviously depends on the speed on the run-oﬀ on
the individual Life portfolio in the Netherlands, but also of the run-oﬀ of the Japan Closed
Block VA portfolio. And keep in mind, as we have mentioned that by 2019, this run-oﬀ is
very much coming to an end. And as a consequence, that beneﬁt of a decrease the SCR
will be more mitigated.
So, I think that in terms of operating capital generation, what you have seen this quarter in
terms of the movement on Own Funds and the change in solvency capital requirement is
nothing unusual. Whenever there is something special, we tend to mention there.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Just back on the real estate revaluation. Obviously, the number in market variance will be
the one that's above your long-term assumption. Can you remind us what your long-term
assumption is for real estate?

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}
Page 13 of 23



Company Name: NN Group NV

Date: 2018-11-15

Yes. For real estate, it's a 4.4% assumption. And obviously, what it comes through the
market variance is whatever additional rental deal that comes on top of these 4.4%, but
also the revaluation of the real estate as well. So, the combination of these two will come
through market variances.

Q - Benoît Pétrarque

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Good morning, everybody. So, the ﬁrst one is again on the own funds capital
generation. I think you have been consistent at around €0.3 billion, even a bit north of
that. Looking at the cost cutting in the pipeline, when do you expect to hit the rounded
€0.4 billion? Will that be early 2019? Could you talk around that? And also, year-to-date,
could you provide kind of the ﬁgure because we have rounded ﬁgures per quarter but I
like to get a kind of year-to-date ﬁgure?
And then the second one was on the dividends from the Life entities. So, the combined
Solvency II ratio is 235%, if I understood correctly. Is there any room for distributing excess
capital from the Life subsidiary post-merger? And then sorry I missed – I joined the call a
bit late but what was the reason of the weaker technical margins in the Netherlands? That
will be useful. Thanks.

In terms of the operating capital generation and when we will reach the €0.4 billion,
diﬃcult to say. There are diﬀerent dynamics here. As you know that the capital generation
is driven by changes in interest rates and it's spread for every single quarter. So, the
impact on the UFR drag, the release of the risk margin as well as the expected (00:41:40)
on our credit ﬁxed income securities including government bonds (00:41:45) vary actually
from one quarter to another. So, that gives some variability there. Also, within this
operating capital generation, you have new business, the operating variances, and the
contribution from Japan Life asset management and the pension business.
So, obviously, we do expect that as we move to higher-yielding assets that we will have an
additional contribution. We also expect that with the improvements in the underwriting
resolved on our Non-life business that we will have some improvements there and also
with the selective growth in areas like Europe and Japan. Then you will have other aspects
like the release of the solvency capital requirement as the run-oﬀs of Japan Closed Block
VA, as I mentioned before, will reduce. And to some extent, to the movement to higheryielding asset the SCR or is the (00:42:48) growth of new business (00:42:50) might, as
you know, not contribute as much to the reduction or even, as you know, add to the SCR.
So, there are a few parts, but I think overall, our targets and objective is to increase, of
course, this operating capital generation over time driven mainly by the improvement
(00:43:10) in the operating results of the company as well as the movement to higher
yielding assets.

Bloomberg Transcript

In terms of second question.

A - Eilard Friese
The year-to-date ﬁgure for the operating capital generation.

A - Delﬁn Rueda Arroyo

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Year-to-date ﬁgure for the operating capital generation is around €900 million. And the
combined ratio of 235% of course, it provides room for excess capital dividends, but as I
said before, we do prefer to have a regular contributor to dividends to the holding
company. So, we are happy with the current rate of dividends coming from this segment
and for the time being we'll maintain it like that until we change of course that approach.
In terms of the technical margin in Netherlands, I think we gave an indication to expect
between 40 and 45 percentage points, and this is basically what we have seen this
quarter. So, nothing too unusual. There was better results in the past, but this was a little
bit, as you know, higher in the previews quarter. But between €40 million and €50 million,
I think is something that is reasonable with the inherent (00:44:46) volatility for this
technical margin.

A - Eilard Friese
Just to avoid misunderstanding, Benoît (00:44:53). So, it's Netherlands Life talking about
and it's millions not percentage. So, it's €40 million to €45 million.

The next question is from Mr. Albert Ploegh, ING. Go ahead, please.

Q - Albert Ploegh

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

Yes, good morning all. Three questions from my end, ﬁrst one on the private equity gains.
Can you remind us what let's say at the end of Q3 more or less the size of the book is and
how you accounted for? Is it basically the equity measures or the fair value accounting?
So, I'd like to understand better (00:45:34) gains or some fair value gains that could
impact the quarterly numbers? That's the ﬁrst question.

Bloomberg Transcript

The second question is on Japan on the COLI market, you've mentioned increased
competition in Q2. I mean the new sales were up still I think 18% if I'm not wrong there
and you mentioned the bancassurance channel being strong in the Sumitomo
partnership. So, can you help us a bit to understand what's going on in the Japanese
COLI markets?
And ﬁnally on the Dutch Non-life business, clearly a very good underwriting result.
Premiums are still pretty ﬂattish but can you maybe give some more feeling on let's say on
the pricing trend, so what is the underlying really growth in gross written premiums and
what is the impact let's say of pruning the portfolio which of course has a negative impact
on the gross written premiums. Thank you.

A - Eilard Friese
Yes, Albert. Private equity, I think that's Delﬁn. Delﬁn, can you do private equity? I'll take
care of the Japan question and Non-life question.

A - Delﬁn Rueda Arroyo

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you very much, Albert. So, I think you're touching into a little bit of a
complicated matter of how this ﬂows through the proﬁt and loss account. So, we'll be
happy to explain that more extensively oﬄine. Maybe I'll try quickly. The majority of our
private equity investments are classiﬁed as associates and joint ventures and a smaller
amount they are classiﬁed as available for sale. So, depending – if the dividends comes
from associates and joint ventures or from available for sale, the treatment is slightly
diﬀerent. So, for associates and joint ventures, the dividends are reﬂected in the
investment margin but at the same time, this is oﬀset by a negative revaluation below the
line, so that basically have not – have no net P&L impact but it is reﬂected in this manner.
However, for those that are available for sale as for example it is the case for our
investment in Korea, this dividends are reﬂected in the investment margin but are only
oﬀset by a change in the revaluation reserve basically with a lower equity value on the

Page 16 of 23

Date: 2018-11-15

balance sheet. I do expect that with this clariﬁcation, you got a bit of a feeling how this
comes, but we'll be happy to explain it oﬄine as well.

Q - Albert Ploegh

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes. That's ﬁne, oﬄine, no worries.

A - Delﬁn Rueda Arroyo

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Thank you.

A - Eilard Friese
Yes. So, on the Japan COLI, let's ﬁrst talk about Japan COLI. Our Japan business over the
last years has seen a marked growth in the segment that it has been operating in for 30
years. So, we're quite a specialist and very well positioned in that segment. We have seen
competition increasing. And as you know, we prioritize margins over volume and I may
also point out that we have moved and shifted to a diﬀerent kind of product mix to
improve the margins. And in Q2 we have presented a value of new business increase of
36% to demonstrate our eﬀorts there.

Bloomberg Transcript

But indeed, we are seeing more competition and of course we are well-positioned, so
we're ﬁghting against that competition as well. So, we've launched, for instance, a new
product last week to maintain commercial momentum and this is something that we'll
work through. And also the relationship with Sumitomo but also other distribution
channels is working very well. And we have good conﬁdence in our growth prospects in
that market in the future.
When it comes to the Dutch Non-life area, well, as Delﬁn mentioned I think earlier on the
call, we're quite pleased with the way that the program that we've rolled out and
announced a year ago at the Capital Markets Day is taking eﬀect. At that time, we've said
that we need 12 to 24 months for the measures to take their full eﬀect and it's a wide
range of measures, as you know, a combination of cost reductions, pruning indeed of the
portfolio for those products that we believe we don't – we can get an appropriate return
on through the cycle. And also looking at each risk, making sure that it's priced well, price
increases where needed, and where we believe it's appropriate. So, we're doing a lot of
things to do that.
And if you look at the last four quarters actually and I know that events like storms, et
cetera, are part and parcel of this business, but in order for us to gauge whether the
measures are taking eﬀect we're actually taking – looking through the storm eﬀect and
then you see for four quarters in a row already step by step improvement. And this
quarter I think the important thing that we've seen both disability and accident and P&C
improving.
In terms of the underlying premium, indeed it's ﬂattish as a total which is a combination of
the pruning on the one hand but then also price increases and premium increases on
repricing risk as one of those measures that is coming through. So, the overall is ﬂattish.

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

But do you think you're getting close to some kind of inﬂection point to show some more
meaningful gross written premium growth or is it still too early to expect that in 2019 for
example?

FINAL

A - Eilard Friese
That's indeed too early to say that. Don't forget that we are really focused on proﬁtability
improvement here. Our objective is to structurally improve this business with a combined
ratio of 97% or below. And that's our objective for this business to make sure it's
structurally in a good and proﬁtable situation.

The next question is from Mr. Henry Heathﬁeld, Morningstar. Go ahead please, sir.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Henry Heathﬁeld

{BIO 19760919 <GO>}

Good morning all. Thank you very much for taking my call. Just on the back of actually
that last question on Non-life, just kind of interested in particularly on the pricing in the
P&C portfolio that you've put through and whether that's kind of been ﬁnalized or how far
through that are you basically whether there's more to come more broadly in the Non-life
segment.
And then the second question is on the motor business that seems to be improving quite
nicely. But the operating environment in the Netherlands seems to be quite a harsh one.
And I was wondering I think basically average claims on the liability side have increased
quite markedly around 40% over the past four years because of the discount rate and
whether you will be able to hold onto the price improvements that you put through if the
discount rate starts to rise again and the average claims cost starts to fall. Thank you.

A - Eilard Friese
Yes. So, Henry, when it pertains to the overall environment I would say what I observe is
rationality improving in the market in general in terms of how much, how far along are we
in the measures that we're taking to improve the proﬁtability of this business. As I said, we
haven't reached our target, right, and we want to have it 97% or below – don't forget the
last piece of that as well. The 97% is one thing but, or below, we should not forget that
either and I want to have it structurally in that place and that's really our priority. So, this is
something that will take more time to put all those measures to be implemented and to
take their full eﬀect. And the kind of guidance we gave for that last year is that we need
like 12 to 24 months before those measures would take their full eﬀect. So, I think that's
where we are. We're still working through this, happy with the progress, but still a lot of
work to be done.

Are you kind of – (00:53:35) pricing within property and casualty kind of going forward or
there'll be some more broader pricing improvements you think (00:53:42)

FINAL

A - Eilard Friese
Well, we are always evaluating the importance of having risks appropriate priced whether
they are in the P&C book or in the disability and accident book. So, we go through this
product-by-product, risk-by-risk and that's how we work.
On the motor business, yes, we saw an improvement this quarter on the motor business,
but again, also there, we believe that we have not implemented all the measures on cost
reductions, et cetera, that we aim to implement. And don't forget that we also want to
build structurally a capability and a stronger place on using data analytics to consistently
and more quickly react to any actions that we feel we need to take for migration of the
risk. And as a result, the necessary pricing of that risk. So, we will continue to work on that
as well.

Q - Henry Heathﬁeld

{BIO 19760919 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I mean do you think that on the average liabilities side, the average kind of claim on the
liability side of the motor book, when that does start to come down, I mean I think that will
start to come down over the next kind of half decade or something, are you going to be
at hold on to that you've been put through or is that going to compress again?

A - Eilard Friese

The next question is from Mr. Bart Jooris, Degroof Petercam. Go ahead, please.

Q - Bart Jooris

{BIO 3470300 <GO>}

Yes. Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. They're basically following up, following on
the last questions. If we look at the improvement of your combined ratio, we see that it is
mostly due to the decrease of the claims ratio. Could you say what part of this is due to
the underwriting improvement as you also had a favorable claim experience? And the
expense ratio actually went up year from year, when did you expect the expense ratio to

Page 19 of 23



Company Name: NN Group NV
Company Ticker: NN NA Equity
Date: 2018-11-15

decrease because that was from the impression of the Investor Day that would take more
time to improve the claims ratio and less time to truly improve the expense ratio.

FINAL

And then a small following question on the change in the corporate tax, will there be a
P&L impact? Your DTAs are relatively low. Your DTLs are higher. Are we seeing valuation
movements there that need to be transferred to the P&L?

A - Eilard Friese
Yes, thanks, Bart, for your questions. So, ﬁrst, the expense ratio, there was some noise I
think in the expense ratio from last year given the Delta Lloyd acquisition. I think this is
better to be explained oﬄine. What I do see, and you can see that from the numbers, is
that we saw a decrease of the expenses this quarter of the Non-life company of around
12%. So, I think also there, the expense reductions are taking place.
When it comes to the overall movement of claims, we saw that the D&A combined ratio
was 94.3%. So, the claims improved compared with the last quarter and the comparative
quarter in the third quarter of 2017. When you look at P&C, we're seeing a gradual
improvement, and we had a little bit of a good claims experienced especially in the ﬁre
book this quarter which I think is important to mention. So, the change in corporate tax
rate on the P&L, Delﬁn?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Delﬁn Rueda Arroyo

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you very much, Bart. Of course, the change in the tax rate will have an impact
on IFRS because the corporate tax rate, as you know, will be smaller. But at the time of
introduction, it can also and it will also have some impact, but that will be a split between
the proﬁt and loss and also another part will come through equity due to the impact on
the revaluation reserves that is actually one of the largest, as you know, aspect of the
deferred tax liabilities and therefore impacting, as you know, the balance sheet.

Q - Bart Jooris

{BIO 3470300 <GO>}

Could you already give a quantiﬁed idea of that?

A - Delﬁn Rueda Arroyo

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

No. I think it's – I mean as you look at it from the perspective of our balance sheet of what
is the impact, as you know, will not be that meaningful, but it is too early in order to
consider to have a proper estimate on that.

FINAL

Q - Robin Eduard van den Broek

{BIO 17002948 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning, everybody. Sorry to come back on the private equity dividends, but
there tends to be a habit to fully exclude them from your operating results whenever you
report them. So, I just want to follow up on Albert's question and basically ask you, do you
think it's fair if these are fully deducted? My understanding is that if there's no cash
upstream basically from the private equity dividend side, that you basically incorporate
zero in your operating results. I would say that, yes, a return of, I don't know, 10%, up to
10% would be quite reasonable on your €700 million book? That's question one.
The second one is on IFRS 17, it will probably be to dragged out a little bit but one of your
peers in the Netherlands has shown that the shadow accounting is a pretty sizable oﬀset
how the ﬁnancial leverage ratio will behave after that adoption. I was just wondering –
earlier on the call, you seem quite conﬁdent on leverage. Is this something that could
change that narrative or are you quite comfortable that under IFRS 17, your leverage ratio
will not go up too much?
And the last question is really the level of excess capital. I mean we're approaching the
levels where you basically were before you acquired Delta Lloyd. I was just wondering if
your feelings about how your balance sheet looks like are similarly comfortable compared
to that point in time. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Eilard Friese
Yes. I will hand over to Delﬁn in a minute but about the habit I hope you would agree with
me that we're not apologizing for having good returns from our private equity book. So,
we're quite pleased with them. But I would like to hand over to Delﬁn on the questions
you have.

A - Delﬁn Rueda Arroyo

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes. No. Thank you, Robin. You're absolutely right, private equity and public equity
dividends is part of our investment return, and it will continue being part of the
investment return. Maybe we are a bit guilty to highlight these. We were trying to provide
useful information in order to see the deviation from one quarter to another because
these don't come always in the same quarter, don't come with the same amount, in order
to make you better informed of how this might be coming through. But absolutely, the
returns on private equity will impact our IFRS but also our Solvency II operating return, as
you know, on an ongoing basis. So, it's a very important element of our investment
portfolio. So, it's not fair to exclude them from our investment return nor to our capital
generation. The level of private equity, as you know, by the end of September were
around €800 million.
IFRS 17, we, of course, don't use shadow accounting and the impact of IFRS 17 that as you
might have already noticed yesterday, the IASB announced a delay of one year on the
implementation of IFRS 17 and IFRS 9 to 1st of January 2022. And it's a bit early in order, as
you know, to see what impacts that will have as it will fundamentally change how we
measure liabilities and proﬁt recognition. So, that applies, as you know, to all insurance

Page 21 of 23

companies. So, it will be closer to a market value, will be – but is still maintaining
diﬀerence (01:02:15) with the Solvency II.
Your last question...

FINAL

A - Eilard Friese
Yes. So, Robin, on your last question regarding capital and the deployment of that. Yes, no
doubt we have a strong Solvency II ratio which has increased driven by operating capital
generation as discussed this morning and by markets (01:02:43). The cash capital position
is in a good place and the balance sheet overall is well. But as you know also, we said this
morning, our focus is on the integration of Delta Lloyd on the improvement of the
performance of the businesses and on accelerating the transformation of the business
model and there's a lot to do on the integration. For instance, the largest units in the
Netherlands, the PIM expansion that was mentioned this morning, the legal mergers, the
Life and Non-life businesses and entities especially in the Netherlands, and as we said
before on deployment, capital in excess of our ambition will be returned to shareholders
over time unless we can put it to work in value-creating opportunities.

And the next question is from Mr. Jason Kalamboussis, KBC. Go ahead, please.

Q - Jason Kalamboussis

{BIO 4811408 <GO>}

Yes. Hi there. I just got two quick questions. The one is on the Non-life side. When I look at
the dividends that were upstream, it was €8 million versus €20 million in the second
quarter. Can you explain – I would have thought that with a better combined ratio and
basically reﬂecting what we see in the quarter, I don't understand very much the
diﬀerence with the second quarter.
And the second question is just quickly on the private equity I think a banking peer has
given a sort of guidance. Would you give guidance or shall we probably take as more
normalized level we saw last year or you prefer to leave it – the answers you have given so
far? Thank you.

A - Eilard Friese
Delﬁn?

A - Delﬁn Rueda Arroyo

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Thank you, Jason. Basically, the dividends that we pay this quarter for Non-life were
basically taken into account, also the results of previous quarters. So, you don't just pay
the dividend of the proﬁts of the quarter. So, I would not read too much into the level of
dividend from Non-life as we do expect going forward that it will continue contributing
Page 22 of 23

FINAL

regular dividends to the holding company. And as we have said in the past, this capital
generation is more or less approximately is to the level of their operating result in terms of
the solvency of capital.
Also take into account that the level of capitalization of the Non-life company is lower
compared, for example, the level of capitalization of the Dutch Life entities which of
course give us much more margin in order to have a more stable dividend quarter-perquarter.
In terms of the guidance for private equity dividends, I think is maybe the only thing that I
can mention is the guidance that we provided in terms of the contribution to our
operating return, which was somehow higher, which is 6.5% expected return. So,
sometimes we'll have signiﬁcantly higher than that, sometimes we might have, as you
know, lower than this. And that diﬀerence on the Solvency II capital generation will be
reﬂected in market variances.

A - Eilard Friese
Yes, thank you very much, operator. I would like to thank everybody for their questions.
And before we end the call, let me conclude by saying that we have reported another
solid set of results for the third quarter of 2018. We're progressing well with the
integration of Delta Lloyd and extracting the synergy beneﬁts and our balance sheet and
capital position remains strong. Our focus remains on delivering on our strategic priorities
and creating long term value for all our stakeholders. I wish you all a pleasant day and
thank you very much for being here.
