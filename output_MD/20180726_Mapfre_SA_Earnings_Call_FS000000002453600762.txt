{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Thank you, Natalia, and good morning everyone. It's a pleasure to be here with you for
our second earnings call of 2018. Let's begin on slide 2 where you can see the main
figures. Revenue and premiums are both down over 8% largely impacted by Forex. As you
know, our exchange rates are falling year-on-year on most of our currencies. U.S. dollar,
Mexican peso and Peruvian sol, all down 9%, approximately. Brazilian real, 16.6%; Turkish
lira, 19.8%; and the Argentinian peso, the worst, with 35% decrease.
At constant exchange rates, premiums are down 2.3%, with around 2% growth in Life and
a 3.4% decline in Non-Life, as a result of our multi-year PEMEX policy issue in 2017. Without
this, premium will have increased by 1.6%. Financial income is also lower due to the
interest rate environment in LATAM, especially in Brazil.
Our combined ratio was stable in 97.4% despite several extraordinary impacts during the
year. The expense ratio reached 28% in line as well with our target. The net result stood
at nearly €386 million, down around 7%, while the adjusted net result was up 1.1% year-onyear. The annualized ROE was around 9%, excluding the impact of 2017 catastrophes.
Please turn to page 3. The quarter has been a mix of different trends but with solid
underlying and improving fundamentals. First of all, I would like to mention two nonrecurring impacts from corporate restructuring plans. The completion of the U.S. exit plan
which had a €7 million negative impact, and extraordinary adjustment in Brazil as a result
of a more prudent balance sheet valuation, with a €9 million negative net impact.

FINAL

On the other hand, our focus on profitable growth and technical management in Non-Life
is showing results with excellent performance in Iberia and MAPFRE RE. Also, we have
consolidated combined ratios close to 95% in LATAM North and South as a result of our
efforts over the last years.
There had been remarkable improvements in Italy and Global Risks and on MAPFRE
ASISTENCIA where the transformation plan is delivering results. Our strict cost contention
policies have also been effective with expense ratio at 28%. Finally, we reported a small
negative run-off from 2017 cat events which is not relevant.

Bloomberg Transcript

Trends are improving in Life with a pickup in Savings products in Spain in the second
quarter as well as a return to growth in Life Protection in Brazil. Higher acquisition
expenses and a fall in financial income in Brazil have been a bit of drag on results, but
they're now stable. Currency movements are still negatively impacting both the P&L and
net equity with an estimated €18 million reduction on the net result and €144 million
decrease on net equity. Finally, I'd like to highlight our excellent Solvency II position which
closed March at 203%.
Please turn to slide 4. On the right, you can see the development of the main results by
region and business unit which we will discuss in more detail in the following slides.
Regarding attributable result, Iberia stands out with €250 million, by far, the largest
contributor. Excluding last year's extraordinary benefit from the cancellation of
bancassurance provision and also the real estate gains, profit will have grown by over
20%. MAPFRE RE continues to be a strong profit contributor with €102 million net result.
The turnaround on MAPFRE ASISTENCIA and better claims experience at Global Risks
have also improved results this year.
Brazil is still facing the strong headwinds from the currency and interest rate environment.
And the fall in the result is North America was impacted by a higher level of winter-related
claims, €11 million in the first quarter, and the execution of the exit plan, €7 million in the
second quarter, as well still complicated market situation particularly in automobile.
Finally, the decline in Eurasia reflects the situation in Turkey from the 2017 MTPL regulation
as well as the depreciation of the lira.
Please turn to slide 5. We continue seeing value creation across our main markets, as
premium growth in local currency is well-above inflation rates in many countries. Non-Life
premiums are down over 3% at constant exchange rates while Life premiums are up
nearly 2%. Excluding the already mentioned multiyear PEMEX policy issued last year, total
premiums are up 1.6% year-on-year at constant exchange rates.
On the right, you have several core business segments have had exceptional
performance. Iberia grew over 7% with the positive developments in main Non-Life
business as well as a pickup in Life sales especially in the Agent channel in Q2. The
recovery of lending activity in Brazil has led to 9% growth in Life premiums and in local
currency.

FINAL

LATAM North is benefiting from the recovery in Mexico where premiums have grown 17%
in local currency, excluding PEMEX, with positive trends in Motor and Health. There is also
double-digit growth in the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, and Honduras. In LATAM
South, the positive trends in Peru are also worth highlighting with nearly 11% local currency
growth. Finally, Puerto Rico is up 25% year-on-year as a result of higher tariffs in
commercial lines. And in North America, the Northeast continues growing over 2% in U.S.
dollars. The Puerto Rico 25% growth is in U.S. dollars as well.
There are a few other regions that are lagging in premium growth. But we are setting the
foundations for future profitable growth. In Brazil, General P&C premiums are down
slightly, and improvement in Motor has been modest. Chile and Colombia continue
cancelling unprofitable business in Non-Motor lines. And in Turkey, the portfolio is still
being reduced in the context of the 2017 MTPL regulation. And finally, business
restructuring in Global Risk, ASISTENCIA, and a decline in the non-Northeast region in the
U.S. have also contributed to our falling premiums.
Please move to next page. On slide 6, you can see the breakdown of key Non-Life figures
by region and unit. Here, I would like to highlight the improvements again in Iberia which I
will cover in more detail later.

Bloomberg Transcript

Regarding Brazil, the combined ratio stood about (00:09:58) 100% due to extraordinary
balance sheet adjustments. Excluding this, the combined ratio will be 93.5% despite the
challenging market situation in Motor. And, finally, LATAM North and South continue
showing improvements across the board.
Please turn the page and I will go through the performance of Non-Life business in more
detail. We'd like to highlight the excellent results of the business in Iberia where we're
growing and gaining market share in key business lines with exceptional profitable levels,
especially Motor with our combined ratio below 90%.
We will discuss these results later but I would like to briefly mentioned the General
Baremo provision. As you may recall, there were €20 million remaining at the beginning of
this year. During Q2, we reallocate his IBNR to case by case reserves, mainly resulting
from the application of the new Baremo income compensation to bodily injury claims from
the old Baremo. This affected a small number of claims and the impact worth €13.5 million
in Motor and €5 million in Commercial TPL. The remaining €1.5 million were released, and
this is the net effect, €1.5 million profit in the profit and loss account for this six-month
period. In Brazil, results were affected by several non-recurring adjustment which I will
discuss later on.
Please turn to slide 8, there was a slight increase in the loss ratio at MAPFRE RE due at –
to a higher level of attritional claims, and a decline in premiums due mainly to currency
movements. As you know, large part of the business is in foreign currencies.
In the Northeast U.S.A., the positive premium trends are mitigating the fall in other states.
Regarding result in the U.S., there have been extraordinary impacts from winter weather
and the cost of the exit plan. We are already seeing the fruits of the profitable growth

tragedy in LATAM North and LATAM South where combined ratio are showing positive
trends. Premiums are growing across the region in local currency except in Colombia and
Chile due to the cancellation of loss-making portfolios.
Please turn to next page. In Eurasia, German and Italian premiums grew around 1% in line
with current market trends. Turkey showed a decline in premiums as a result of stricter
underwriting guidelines as expected in the context of the 2017 MTPL regulation, and the
related increase the Motor combined ratio.
Premiums at Global Risks were down, negatively affected by Forex movements, but the
loss experience was positive in the quarter. Business volumes were down at ASISTENCIA
(00:13:32) as expected as a result of portfolio cleansing and office closings, with a
significant extremely relevant (00:13:39) €22 million reduction in losses at June. It is
noteworthy that ASISTENCIA reported a small profit
during the second quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

On slide 10, you can see an update of last year's cat events with a €6.7 million negative
run-off during the first half of the year affected mainly Puerto Rico where over 7,000
claims – new claims were reported after March this year. Obviously, this trend wasn't
expected at that time.
Please turn to slide 11. We've seen improving trends in Life but it continues to be
negatively impacted by currency movements with premiums down by 4%. In Iberia we
have seen improvements especially in the Agent channel, thanks to sales campaigns. Last
year results included one-offs stemming from the cancellation of a provision for
bancassurance contingent payment as well as the Duero Vida gain.
In Brazil, premiums are up 9% in local currency but continue to be hurt by currency
depreciation. Results here are still affected by higher acquisition expenses in order to
book sales especially in the bancassurance channel as well as the fall in financial income,
around €57 million due to lower returns on floating rate and inflation-linked bonds.
Let's skip page 12 where we show Life highlights. On slide 13, I would like to talk about the
extraordinary items that have affected MAPFRE's net result. The first quarter's result was
affected by multiple – by more (00:15:40) severe storms, snow storms in the Northeast
U.S.A. with an €11.5 million net loss. We already reported in the first quarter, and this figure
compared to a €43 million net loss from the Coastal Niño last year.
There were several corporate transactions in 2017 comprising the sale of Unión Duero
business, the sale of the Life annuity business in Peru, the gain from the purchase of
minority stakes in ABDA Indonesia, and the restructuring at MAPFRE ASISTENCIA. These
had a total net impact of €16 million-positive in 2017. This year, corporate transaction
include the negative €7 million euro impact from exiting business in the U.S. Realized gains
are down this year due to the absence of real estate gains compared to the €20 million
net impact in 2017. And finally, 2017 figures also reflect a €27 million net gain from the

FINAL

reversal of the provision for continued liabilities in bancassurance. And all in all, excluding
this impact, the adjusted net result is up 1.1% (00:17:04).
Please turn to slide 14. Now, I would like to discuss the good performance on Non-Life
business in Spain, which is a clear example of the success of the profitable growth
strategy. The Non-Life transformation process implemented in 2015 led to an increase in
pre-tax profit from €259 million to €454 million in two years. The main driver of this was
the improvement of the combined ratio from 97.2% to the 93.7%. Currently, the combined
ratio remains quite stable at 93.7%.
In the first half of 2018, MAPFRE has continued reinforcing his leading position in the NonLife Spanish market gaining market share in Motor, Commercial, Health business, and
Condominiums. Despite the stricter underwriting policies and tariff discipline, MAPFRE
outperformed the market in Motor with 2.9% premium growth, 2.9% as well in retail and
moderate (00:18:26) return to growth in fleets at 2.4%.
On the bottom right, you can see the average Motor premium growth. In the first half of
2018, MAPFRE's growth was negative 0.7% in line with the market, negative, as well, 0.5%.
In the previous three years, MAPFRE growth was well above the market, reflecting
MAPFRE's strategy focus on profitability. The current excellent combined ratio allows us to
be more competitive in tariffs and return to certain segments such as small fleets.

Bloomberg Transcript

Since December 2017, the Motor combined ratio has been around 5 points below the
market, as a result of initiatives to control and reduce claims and expenses. At the close
of June 2018, MAPFRE's Motor combined ratio stood at 89.3%.
Please turn to slide 15. On June 26, we announced the update on MAPFRE's strategic
alliance with Banco do Brasil.
On this slide, you have the main features and fundamentals of the transaction. The base
price was agreed at BRL 2.4 billion, around €515 million at the end of June, adjusted for
dividends, equivalent to approximately 1.5 times book value. The expected return on
investment is 10%. And we have set three-year targets for the Brazilian business including
over 6% average total premium growth; combined ratio below 96% (00:20:25), below
100% in Motor; and ROE above 12%.
On slide 16, you can see historical on June data by holding and entity Brazil. This is new
information. This is the first time we disclose this entity's numbers. The June results were
affected by several extraordinary adjustments as a result of a more prudent – I will repeat
– more prudent and conservative balance sheet valuation. There were around €24 million
in negative adjustments affecting SH2, and a €15 million positive adjustment in SH1. Full
disclosure of the adjustments are at the bottom of the slide.
Please turn to next page. We have successfully completed, and in less than six months,
the exit plan for the U.S. business that was announced our last Investor Day. This operation
had a total of €7 million negative impact on June's net result, which is a small – we
consider small, considering the scope of the transaction.

FINAL

On the right, you can see that our core business region, the Northeast, is very profitable
with a €22.6 million net result despite the impact of the winter storms and the challenging
Motor market conditions. The losses in the non-Northeast have fallen by over a third to €9
million. And as we have mentioned, there are several profitability initiatives in place to
continue improving results including tariff increases, predictive analytics, and agency
channel management.
Regarding Verti, around (00:22:28) expenses are budgeted for (00:22:31) operations,
especially IT-related. And marketing expense there are quite low up-to-date. As already
announced, the board of directors agreed to reorganize the Global Risk business. This
slide presents the rationale behind this operation. The new structure offer us greater
stability and efficiency, greater client focus, and better control of exposures.
On the following slides, I will discuss the balance sheet items, Solvency II, and embedded
value. Please turn to slide 19. Shareholders' equity has fallen by over €154 million from
December to June to around €8.5 billion. The net unrealized gains of the available-forsale portfolio fell by over €150 million and currency conversions differences fell by over
€140 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

These declines were driven by several market movements, the depreciation of our main
currencies during the period, as we already mentioned, higher deals in Europe and in the
U.S., and the fall in European equity markets during the period, both over euro stocks and
also IBEX 35.
Please turn to slide 20. On the left, you can see that assets under management are down
slightly since the beginning of the year. This is mainly a result of the impact of currency
movements on assets in Brazil and other non-euro countries, as well as the volatility in
peripheral (00:24:25) bonds. The breakdown of the investment portfolio is on the right.
Asset allocation has been a stable throughout the year.
Equity and mutual fund exposure has slightly fallen due to market impacts within the
second quarter. On the right, as you may see, the largest exposure correspond to
Spanish sovereign debt with a €16.2 billion, followed by Italian sovereigns with €2.3 billion
as well.
Finally, I would like to mention that we have achieved our target of €450 million invested
in alternative assets, including real estate and private equity funds principally. With an
expected yield in the range between 4% and 6%. Non-Life realized gains in the first half of
2018 amounted to around €6.3 million – sorry – €63 million, €29 million lower than last year
due to the lack of real estate gains.
During the second quarter, Spanish debt, which is the main asset in our investment
portfolio, has been very volatile though we have been able to take advantage of market
volatility to slightly increase or reduce duration and prepare the portfolio for an increase in
interest rates expected for the second part of next year. It is worth pointing out, the high
accounting yields in our portfolios, over 2.3% percent in Non-Life and nearly 4% in Life.
Well above market yields.

Please turn to next page. On the left side, you can see the breakdown of the capital
structure which amounted to €12.6 billion. We had €260 million undrawn on our credit
facility at June 30, and we have significant Tier 2 capacity for new issuance.

FINAL

Let's move on to Solvency II. The Solvency II ratio stood at 203% at March 31, up 3
percentage point this year. And confirming MAPFRE's strong Solvency position allow
volatility. We have a high quality capital base with 93% of Eligible Own Funds in Tier 1.
Let's move on to the slide 24. Embedded value grew over 60% in 2017. This improvement
is explained by the inclusion for the first time of Life and Burial business in Peru and Brazil
Life. So, it's an increase in scope. And second, the improvements in their financial margins
of a Spanish Life Savings products net of credit risk. Our return on embedded value is high
over 18%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Please turn to slide 25. To change the focus, before coming to the end. In MAPFRE,
business is measured in more than numbers. And behind the numbers, there are people.
So, from now on, we will include non-financial indicators in our presentations. These
indicators are representative for our social commitment under our company in addition to
being profitable must be sustainable and contribute to social development. On this page,
you can see the most important indicators.
First one, it is we're (00:28:30) moving ahead on our commitment to equality. We are
already very close to complying with the target of 40% of women in managerial positions
which was set for the year end. MAPFRE also wants to be recognized as an inclusive
company which provides opportunities to everyone. We have already exceeded the
target of at least 2% of our workforce comprising people with disabilities. And regarding
the personal and professional growth of our employees, at the end of the first half of
2018, 7.2% of our workforce has changed positions. The target for the full year is 10%. We
are extremely happy with the performance of these three indicators.
Our investment portfolio has been adapted to ESG standards. And 80% of corporate
issuers have a sustainability grading. And 95% of the market value of this group of issuers
has an above average scoring.
To wrap things up, I would like to make a few closing remarks. First, of all we have
achieved our restructuring target for Brazil and the U.S. and are ready to enter into a
strategic execution phase. We are quite pleased with our current business footprint and
focus which is now aligned with our strategy and risk appetite.
Finally, this first half of the year has been positive in terms of profit generation in a quite
challenging environment. And we are confident in Mapfre's ability to continue creating
value while meeting our commitments with our shareholders and society as a whole in a
sustainable and responsible way.
That's all from my side. Thank you. And now I will hand the call over to Natalia to begin the
Q&A session.

FINAL

Q&A
A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

So now we will start with the Q&A session. The first one comes from Michael Huttner from
JPMorgan. It's regarding ASISTENCIA (31:13) If ASISTENCIA worsens to 104% combined
ratio in 2Q 2018 from 102% in first Q, when will this business deliver on your expectations
and your targets? Do you need to consider another round of large provisions like what's
done now in Brazil?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Michael. Yeah, looking at the numbers reported by ASISTENCIA, it looks like
there's still very few to change and we're quite happy. After two years, with the changes
or the fruit of the changes will come up earlier. But in the end, this is the first year that
we're happy and we are harvesting the fruit of the implementations made.
ASISTENCIA's combined ratio increased 1.7 percentage points to approximately 103%
basically due to the pressure from expenses where reductions are underway. I'd say that
restructuring measure are being successfully implemented. I mean, the loss ratio had an
significant improvement of 3.6 points to a quite low approximately 62%. And the main
driver of the improvements comes from the other activities rather than the insurance side
result which is already given positive figures with almost €18 million improvement. So let's
say, there are these €22 million reduction in losses practically (32:57) are coming from
other activities rather than insurance.
Regarding future adjustment and as I said, there are very few things left in the assets of
ASISTENCIA. So we're quite comfortable. Perhaps there is small adjustments in the future,
but quite small. And also, we expect this year a single-digit loss and this is indication will
include any potential adjustments. And as we said as well and it's included in the financial
report, we reported a small profit in the second quarter which is, I mean, we're quite
happy, I mean, with this performance in the second quarter.

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay, thank you. The next block of questions is concerning Mapfre Brazil. The first one is
the – comes from Andrew Sinclair at Merrill Lynch. Even excluding one-offs, the Brazilian
Non-Life technical results in Q2 was negative. How soon do you expect to be able to
return to a positive technical result?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Thank you for your question, Andrew. And yeah, you're right the Non-Life technical result
in Q2 in Brazil was negative €32 million. The pre-tax and minority impact on the balance
sheet adjustment in Non-Life were around €90 million, a little bit lower, I think maybe €88
Page 8 of 22



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2018-07-26

million, €89 million. Therefore, the technical result was roughly €56 million and the
combined ratio excluding this impact like 93%. Let's say that the underlying performance
has been satisfactory. We're confident with the three-year target we announced for Brazil
for our Non-Life combined ratio below 96% and motor below 100%.

FINAL

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. Next question also comes from Andrew Sinclair. If we can confirm that
there is no change in ownership of Companhia Seguros Aliança do Brasil from the
proposed Banco do Brasil transaction, and yes, we can confirm.

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yes, Andre. Thank you. Yes, you agree. We can confirm that their stake in H1 remains 25%.

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

This is the – if I may add something, this is the life company for the bancassurance
business. And it's the same, with the same stake. Next one also from Andrew Sinclair is
what changes do you expect for holding's other business and consolidation adjustments
as a result of the transaction? Can you confirm that the pro forma group earnings would
have been in the transaction had been completed in 2017?
Also regarding this topic, Michael Huttner from JPMorgan has this question. If I work
backwards, it implies that the underlying profitability of this business in the past five years
would have been €50 million pre-tax lower and that also changes the valuation on your
€0.6 million investment from say, 10 times historic average earnings to around 11.5 times.
Is this assumption right?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah thank you both of you for the questions. As I said, this is the first time we're giving
you historical data and a breakdown by holdings and entities. And I get with this
information, I mean, you're able to make a better estimation with your estimates. Also as
we mentioned in the past, this minority that we're acquiring will have contributed around
€420 million over the seven, eight years of the agreement, I mean, from the 2010 to 2017.
We prefer not to give any further disclosures regarding pro forma figures until the
transaction is closed, but we feel you have enough data, I mean, to make your own
estimates together with the guidance we have given.
A couple of comments regarding the adjustments in H2. As I mentioned this is – they were
based in a more prudent accounting basis and also, as some of you are mentioning, let's
say that the majority of the adjustment, we'll sure allocate it to priorities. And (38:08)
basis – more prudent basis, it doesn't mean that – it means that we will see in the future
whether or not we'll see a positive or negative development of the adjustment made in
reserves. But the (38:27) one is to have a more solid and robust balance sheet before the
transaction date and following MAPFRE's tenders.

FINAL

Okay, thank you very much, Fernando. Now this block of questions is concerning Iberia.
(38:45) at Caixabank BPI, Niccolo Dalla Palma at Exane BNP Paribas, Ivan Bokhmat from
Barclays, and Michael Huttner from JPMorgan have asked about the good evolution of the
trends affecting the Iberian motor insurance and the Baremo provision?
Motor in Iberia is now at 90% combined ratio. How much is sustainable and how much is
due to reserve releases from the Baremo extra reserve in 2015, 2016? Can you talk about
the pricing and claims trends please?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Thank you all of you for the questions. I mean, my first conclusion is that we're
extremely happy with the Iberia performance. Looking back three or four years ago, I
mean, in the depth of the Spanish crisis, we were suffering. Remember 15% decrease in
premiums and a combined ratio near 100% and our (39:49) distribution channel suffering
because of the fixed cost of this channel. And now we can learn the numbers and
premium growth, units growth, combined ratio below 90%. We're extremely happy. Let's
say that we made our homework and we went to implement a similar trend, a similar
initiative in the rest of the country that they are still performing with combined ratio
underperforming and with combined ratios over 100.
Our goal in a very healthy growth profitability but without losing our competitiveness. As I
mentioned, this is the first time that we, after three or four years, that we go in some
segments of business at a small fleet. But we believe that with this combined ratio,
there's still room for further improvements without jeopardizing our excellent technical
result. Let's say that in the long run, we should consider 92% as a more reasonable level
of combined ratio for automobile. It doesn't mean that there is room for a price war,
forget it. I mean, I don't want you to understand this.
Let's say in the two, three past years, we abandoned some of (41:24) of clients and also
we increase tariff and now our objective is to have both premium increase and also units
increase in order to gain market share in both premiums and number of vehicles.
Regarding the Baremo, we're very happy. And looking back as well in 2015, let me wrap
up what we've done with Baremo. In 2015, we increased our IBNR €35 million in order that
to cover and potential increases in previous years. It came as a result of the new Baremo
implementation. I guess – and now the numbers say that we were right. It was a prudent
accounting basis and after one and a half year of experience last year, we've released €15
million of this provision and it was taken into the profit and loss account.
After two and a half years of experience with our actuary teams and reevaluated against
the increase in the average cost claims and also new trends, I think we have enough
experience in order to reallocate these IBNR reserve to individual clients.
So, in the books what we had is a reduction of the IBNR reserves for €20 million, €15
million in automobile and €5 million in general PPO, an increase in the individual in the case
by case reserves by €5 million in general TPL and €13.5 million in automobile case by case
reserve.

FINAL

This increase affected to just, if I remember well, 13 individual claims. They were severe
claims and what we're seeing is an increase in the cost of some indemnities for severe
disabilities and also debts. Majority of the charges, they're applying for previous Baremo
claims, the higher range, or indemnities which is quite close to the new Baremo.
Let's say the social, it is like a social try in order to equalize or to make equal, I mean, both
Baremos for some severe claims. So in the end, the net effect in the profit and loss
account is this first half of the year is this €1.5 million before tax which is non-relevant. And
in terms of combined ratio, if I'm making the numbers correctly, is like 15 percentage
points reduction in the Spanish automobile combined ratio.
So let's say that the...

Percentage points.

Sorry. 15, I mean, it was...

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

It's nothing.

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

...it was nothing relevant. So let's say that for MAPFRE, the Baremo discussion practically is
over. And now, we will go – what we have to monitor is just the development of this
individual 30 claims in order to see if in the end, I mean, the final cost is the one we have
reserved today. And that's basically, I mean, the Baremo. Let's say the Baremo fortunately
is over with, let's say, (45:27) when we increased the IBNR perhaps more prudent as we
should because it was a release of provisions in two years, one non-relevant in 2019 and
€15 million last year. But as always, MAPFRE will follow quite prudent accounting basis
regarding technical provisions.

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much for your comprehensive response and thoughts about the
Baremo and Iberia. Thank you very much. I hope it helps. Next one comes from Ivan
Bokhmat from Barclays. It's about combined ratio, in the second quarter, appears to be

weaker despite with survey leases and due to weather claims. What do you consider this
to be the appropriate run rate for 2018?

FINAL

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Well, it's very difficult to calculate the run rate for this length due to the impact of the
seasonal related claims, weather related claims. They say that the increase in the
combined ratio in the second quarter was due to bad weather conditions that affected to
homeowners, condominiums and agriculture and insurance. It was severe fire claims in
commercial line and also as well as higher frequency in transport line. But let's say the – I
mean, the fundamentals are good and we believe that we shouldn't expect any negative
trend in the future effect in combined ratio.

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Thank you. This one is regarding life business. (47:14) asking about the expected evolution
of life insurance premiums in Spain going forward.

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Sophia. (47:23) I mean, as you know very well, I mean, it's practically impossible
to forecast the expected evolution of the life insurance premiums in Spain. There are up
and downs of a premium growth of 30% one year without any factional explanation
behind it. In Spain, majority of the life business premiums trends are driven by let's say
financial institution appetite. And majority of the case, they follow different strategies from
different financial institutions when they want to increase well deposits or well insurance
products.
What can I say is that the expected evolution for MAPFRE which is the one we monitor, the
first quarter, it wasn't a good one and redemptions, we didn't have practically redemption
in the first quarter so the volume of premiums decreased. But the second quarter has
been more positive and more promising.
And we expect the trend for the remaining part of the remaining quarters to be positive
as well. We have been actively launching several unit link products over the last few
months. And even just this week we announced a new campaign for dividend VIDA which
is the, I mean, let's say this is recovering product, the unit link that we invest in – it invest in
the Spanish shares with high dividend. But these are permanent product, and it's
performing extremely well. So all in all, let's say that the third and the fourth quarters
should follow the second quarter trend rather than the first quarter.

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Thank you so much. Now, the next block of questions is regarding MAPFRE U.S.A. The first
one is coming from Michael Huttner at JPMorgan and it's regarding the combined ratio in
North America in the second quarter. That has been 99.8%, and can you say how
sustaining all of this is?

FINAL

Well, as I said for Iberia, Michael, we're quite happy as well with the end of the
restructuring plan in the U.S. Now, we are in tax exclusion phase, and figures are more
promising as well. We also see a strong improvements in the non-Northeast region with
an over 35% reduction in losses. I didn't say during my presentation but I can add, a few
relevant states have already been reported profits over the last few months, including
California with total profit in June. We are quite happy, I mean, with this result. California is
a quite challenging state as well with a lot of competition.
Regarding VERTI, the business plan is on initial launch, it's a soft launch and have been
both quite conservative. As I've said, marketing expenses, they're still quite low. And as
we said as well, during the Investor Day and in the launch of both the business in the U.S.
will be revisit every two years in order to monitor performance and premium growth. In
the U.S. regarding the outlook, in the U.S. the second half of the year is usually better in
terms of profitability but in the long run, for MAPFRE, for us, day one, and for MAPFRE
U.S.A. will be January 1, 2019.

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. The following question is from Andrew Sinclair at Merrill Lynch. And is
what level of premium increases have you been able to put through on your U.S.
portfolio?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Okay. We usually don't disclose this information but we have it and we're going to do it.
We are quite promising with the numbers and is basically to the rate increase. Rate
increase, 5% in Massachusetts, in Maine, 6% in Rhode Islands in January. Additional several
filings in California as well as in Connecticut and Washington among others. But let's say
more filings have been in excess of 5%. We expect these hikes to be big enough in order
to affect the current increase in risk cost and frequency we've seen in the United States
particularly in motor lines,
In Massachusetts, we already seen a number of players taking rate increases as well and
following MAPFRE trend, you know that MAPFRE is the leader in terms of market share in
Massachusetts, which is a good sign for the market.

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much. Now the next one come from Ivan Bokhmat from Barclays and
is what would you consider to be the normalized operating profit run rate after the
footprint is complete in the U.S.? It appears 2Q 2018 results have both €7.2 million impact
from disposals and €3.5 million hit from Puerto Rico results. Adjusting these the result for
these moves, should we think of €10 million profit per quarter as a base case that you
could aim to improve on going forward?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Thank you, Ivan, for your questions. First, I mean, let's say that the footprint or the
restructuring in the U.S. or the carbon footprint, I mean, is not the one we expect them to
be in the future. As you remember during the – at our Investor Day, we split the United
Page 13 of 22

FINAL

States in three different categories. First is Northeast, Massachusetts and the four states
around, the exit states and another category in the middle that there is a bulk of states
including California and Florida as well. But, those are in which we have the agreement
with the AAA motor club. It means that these middle categories under review on a
permanent basis. We monitor it closely any state, any line of business and any change of
trend in order to make corrections or in order to put in the exit room these operations in
these states.
Regarding guidance for the U.S. business, the only thing that I can say at this moment is
that we've reaffirmed the 2020 targets announced at the Investor Day, our last investor
day for MAPFRE Insurance and it was excluded. I remember excluding VERTI is a 4%
average growth in U.S. dollars and a combined ratio around 97% and VERTI U.S.A. will add
– it was excluding VERTI and VERTI U.S.A. will add around 1 percentage point to this target
and the expected ROI is in line with the U.S. ROE and around 8%.

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Thank you very much. (55:54) would like to know also regarding VERTI U.S.A. The net loss
of €5.5 million in the first half of 2018, should we expect a similar impact in the second
half ? When will you reach breakeven?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

I mean, it's a difficult question but let's say that most of the loss, they're overheads
because they currently – our portfolio is merely $300,000 more or less. So, let's say that
most of the result, they're overheads. And let's say that the €5 million loss is in the
budget range and the second quarter overheads will depend on how good are we in this
fine tune adjustments of tariffs in order to promote and increase in premiums during the
second half of the year.

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. There is also a question from (57:02) regarding the U.S. business is can
you explain the cost of the minus €7.2 million impact from the asset states. Does it include
New York and New Jersey? Sshould we expect additional impacts in 2018?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you, Pat. (57:21) This impact are a result of the completed sales, the three
ones: the Life business, the renewal rights transfer in Tennessee, Kentucky, and Indiana,
and the third one is the sale agreement for New York and the renewal portfolio rights for
New Jersey which the two large operation there still pending – sorry, the New York is still
pending from the regulatory approvals.
We do not expect really an additional impact in 2018, the remaining impact of the year.
This is our first estimate because the completion date, we expected that fourth quarter
and the final consideration is quite similar to Brazil. It will depend on the net equity after
adjustments (58:14) such as dividends. But we do not expect any relevant additional
impact on these results.

FINAL

Okay. Great. Now, we are changing topics. We are moving to MAPFRE RE and Global Risks.
Michael Huttner on JPMorgan and Ivan Bokhmat from Barclays have asked about the
increase in the impact of 2017 nat cat losses? The hurricane lost is continuing to drift
upward albeit modestly. Can you explain the driver to this? Also peers have recently seen
negative loss development for Irma and Maria. Is there room for further result
strengthening?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Thank you, Michael. I mean, this increase is the result of the higher claims reported – new
claims reported in Puerto Rico in the first half of 2018, and principally in the second
quarter.
But as you may see this amount is not relevant (00:59:17). If I remember well, it was like
7,000 new claims filed in Puerto Rico for Maria hurricane after March.

Bloomberg Transcript

I mean, the net cost is still particularly in the middle of the range, between €150 million
and €175 million. I know that there was a positive release, quite small in the first quarter
because we are permanently evaluating any potential negative or positive development
in the runoff of the cat losses. And once again, I mean, we want to highlight MAPFRE's
excellent reinsurance program and the professional capacity of MAPFRE with executives in
order to assess the best estimation for the cash cost.
Let me say that MAPFRE was the first reinsurance in order to publish an estimation
comprising default capacity presented (01:00:37) the third quarter 2017. And I'm sure and
MAPFRE is the best reinsurance estimating any change in the net cost of those
catastrophes on ongoing basis.

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Thank you. Thank you very much. Andrew Sinclair and Ivan Bokhmat from Barclays, Andrew
from Bank of America, Merrill Lynch have asked about the increase in attritional claims,
were there any particular trends here or any specific countries affected?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yes, thank you, Andrew. The second quarter in – we have not been affected by
catastrophic events but we have seen a higher frequency of attritional claims. I mean, for
GLOBAL and for MAPFRE, attritional claims is between €1.5 million and €5 million, more or
less. But anyway these claims are within the loss budget and we haven't seen any
particular trend. This is, let's say that the frequency is unusual and the attritional trend is
quite similar to previous year. But what's different was the lack of attritional claims in the
first quarter but this second quarter follows similar trends, the one we have, what we have
in previous years.

Okay. Andrew Sinclair also wants to know how much did reinsurance protection cover
renewals increase after the success of your reinsurance program last year?

FINAL

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you, Andrew, again with respect to the renewal season, MAPFRE RE was
(01:02:23) renewed between June and July in Southern main markets including the U.S.,
the Caribbean and the LATAM and follow the structure we presented, that Eduardo Pérez
de Lema presented at our last Investor Day. We haven't changed our structure and the
structure performed very well last year and we want to keep to maintain the same cat
protection.
Nevertheless, the total cost of our reinsurance protection in this region, I mean in U.S.,
Caribbean and especially in Puerto Rico remains stable. And because we have reduced
our exposure to these rates, mainly at global rates (01:03:10) in order to compensate the
increase of rates. (01:03:13)
There were limited tariff increases in programs not affected by last year's catastrophe,
between flat and 5% which we consider as moderate due to the still high level of excess
capacity and we are still seeing soft market conditions in some regions. But not those
regions affected, but the cat losses last year.

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Good. The next one is from Ivan Bokhmat, Pat Ojeda. They have asked around MAPFRE
GLOBAL RISKS reorganization. How will your reporting change after the announced
adjustment to Global RISKS corporate structure? How much of the current premiums and
operating result is related to MAPFRE Iberia, and how much to MAPFRE RE? What benefits
in terms of profits and synergies can be expected from this restructuring?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Okay. Let's say that the fundamentals and the rationale behind the restructuring was very
well explained at the presentation. There is another current (01:04:23) release and there
is more information in the different documents that are available in our website – on our
website. Let's say that the – I mean, just to summarize, to wrap up, I mean the transaction.
Basically what we're doing is a transfer of asset of insurance and reinsurance assets and
liabilities to MAPFRE RE, in order to have a larger and more solid balance sheet, a much
better (01:04:56) balance sheet next year.
Regarding MAPFRE GLOBAL RISKS unit, we will keep as the current one. I mean, GLOBAL
RISKS for us is a unit – is a strategic unit, and we want to keep the best service and the
best quality level to our clients. That means that we have to prepare some pro forma
information regarding the different premiums that will be a spread of primary insurance
particularly in Spain and also in LATAM.

Page 16 of 22

FINAL

And then put together the profit contribution coming from the GLOBAL RISKS
independent entity, also the GLOBAL RISKS business running in the different primary
insurance, and also the GLOBAL RISKS business that has been retained in MAPFRE RE.
(01:05:45) So, let's say it's just a translation or transaction of balance sheet items to
MAPFRE RE and premiums to LATAM and MAPFRE Iberia. (01:06:01) But the unit as the one
we have will remain with the same capacities, competence, within MAPFRE group.

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much. And next one is regarding Brazil. It comes from Michael
Huttner, Andrew Sinclair, Sophia Barallat (01:06:25) Sylvia Rigol and Ivan Bokhmat, is
regarding the Brazil provision in non-Life that was around €88 million gross of tax and
minorities. Can you explain what this relates to and what is the Life provision release of
€108 million in Brazil?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Thank you, all of you. I guess this is the topic of the presentation, Brazil. Let me give
you – I mean, my explanation separating the two different holdings. Regarding non-Life or
let's say the future non-Life asset one that will be run by MAPFRE, 100% shareholding. And
as a result of the valuation process in this type of – normally, in this type of transaction,
where we apply this, the more conservative and prudent valuation basis to the different
balance sheet items.
The review has been gradual and some of these adjustments I maybe do recall were
carried out in the first quarter. I mean, it was an increase in reserves for bodily injure
outstanding claims in SH (01:07:39) structure. And other adjustments, they were booked in
the second quarter. And even – I mean the analysis is not finished, it's 99% – is 90%-plus
finished. But there is still some adjustment that may come up in July, but non-relevant and
minor adjustments.
Regarding Life, – what we want, as I said, is to have quite solid and robust balance sheet
items at the translation date and following MAPFRE accounting standards. Regarding Life,
SH 1 (01:08:18) that they will remain with the current structure. In the case of this holding,
the reversal of the, we call the unexpired rates provision probably, I mean this concept's
(01:08:32) familiar to you. It try to cover premium deficiency or loss-making products was
a result of a change in the Brazilian local – in the GAAP accounting standards.
These reserves that they're coming from previous year quite long ago was a calculation in
a product by product basis rather than a line of business which is normal in Europe
particularly in Spain. And now the calculation is made in a more aggregated basis and as a
result of this, it resulted this amount was a partial release as well for MAPFRE.
Partial means that probably over two-thirds of the adjustment has been booked as of
June 30 but there is still further analysis that are being carried out in July and August in
order to fully comply with IFRS Accounting Principles which is the accounting that we report
in MAPFRE. So these adjustments were identified and let's say considered during the
assessment process of the transaction. So let's say that the adjustments or the value of

Page 17 of 22



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2018-07-26

this adjustment, we'll consider it and the assessment of the entities that form an integral
part of the agreement with Banco do Brasil.

FINAL

All in all, I mean, we do not expect in July and nor in August any net impact or any further
adjustment to be significant enough to be or we consider them as a whole to be neutral
for the profit and loss account of MAPFRE.

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Thank you so much. And they also wanted to know why do you not adjust for these
impacts on page 13 of presentation, attributable adjusted results?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Well probably you're right, I mean, but we consider the majority of adjustment as a prior
year's adjustment. What is important is for the net profit generational contribution of this
year, this is one-off, which is removed for further predictions. We do not adjust as 2018
pro forma because we should adjust as well 2017 and prior years. So, I mean, if you want
to make it, I mean do it and quite simple, but we can consider this as an adjustment not to
be adjusted in 2018 net result.

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay, thank you. With regards to the Banco do Brasil transaction, could you clarify whether
the 10% ROE on the Banco do Brasil acquisition includes synergies. And over what
timeframe do you expect to reach the 10% level?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah. First of all, the synergies are not the main drivers on ROE improvement. I mean, the
main driver is the room for change that we have identify particularly in Motor line business
in Brazil and that we are currently implementing. That's all.

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay. the 12% (01:12:10) ROE in three years' time implies on my numbers more than
doubling the current run rate of profits. Which may be challenging taking into account, the
volatile dynamics of the country's economy and currency. Does this target include some
actions in the equity part of the equation? I mean, a capital repatriation?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Listen, I don't think so. I mean, this is still too early to conclude on this topic. But then what
we disclose is that the excess of equity and also the cash available at the holding we will
fully devote to pay part of the consideration. And let's say that we expect the most from
the Brazilian economy. So, we should as well to retain some of the results in our equity in
order to fund the premium growth we're expecting in Brazil. So, let's say that roughly
speaking and to be honest at this point, we do not consider any potential repatriation
from Brazil.

Okay. Thank you very much. And now, can you give us some color on the planned
measures to bring the combined ratio to your targeted level?

FINAL

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah. Regarding planned measures, we first take into account that we expect the
transaction to close in the third quarter. And once the transaction is finished, and we will
be ready to have a full implementation of all the actions that I said, we have identified a
large number of different initiatives in order to increase our efficiency there. But anyway,
despite this transitional period, we had already implemented some minor measures, let's
say, to Brazil Life, (01:14:04) their organizational structure and processes. And let me say
that we are working on a new organizational chart for SH 2 (01:14:14) that they will take
effect probably in the coming weeks.
Remember that we mentioned as well that we sent – we deployed a tax force comprising
all of our tax people (01:14:28) from Motor Spain, from technical areas, actuaries, yeah.
And there's a lot of initiatives in the past (01:14:38) looking at this currently in the pipeline
that were identified by this task force (01:14:46) in February, involving actuarial, technical,
tariff, commercial (01:14:53), products, client handling, et cetera. But all in all, as I said for
the U.S. for MAPFRE BRAZIL, day one will be next January 1 and the two remaining
quarters will be just the initial phase of the execution plan.

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much. There are three more questions regarding Brazil if you don't
mind. To give you a rest, I can answer them.

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah. I need to drink some water. Thank you, Natalia. Too many questions just in a row,
yeah.

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Yeah, I can answer them because they are straightforward answers. Could you explain the
strength of the Brazilian Life technical result in the quarter? The main figure that has come
in this quarter is the reversal of the provision in the SH1 (01:15:53) holding and it is €108.8
million gross, that is before taxes and minorities, which was €50 million after taxes and
minorities.
And also we have seen a better level of claims in Life-Protection. Also, there's a question
regarding the increase in minorities in Brazil. The increase of minorities in the first half of
2018 versus first half of 2017 is due to a higher amount of results coming from the Life
holding in which MAPFRE has lower shareholding, 25% only.
And regarding the finance of the Brazilian transaction, are you planning to raise debt?

FINAL

Yeah. I mean, there is no change in the way we're going to finance, I mean the transaction.
There is – as I said there's still an excess of available cash in the insurance holding in Brazil,
100% shareholder in MAPFRE is well over €200 million.
And the remaining part of the consideration, I mean currently we got a credit facility
undrawn in order to cover this part. But as I said, we want to keep our solvency ratio at the
current level. And so the most likely situation we'll ease – we will go for a new issuance
when market conditions are more favorable and probably will be after summer. August, I
mean, is quite a season in Spain.
And it will be for sure a Tier 2 in order to have the same capital level for Solvency II and
also for rating agencies which is important as well where we've (01:17:59) seen today a
quite important revaluation of the real.
And in order to hedge part of the consideration, we hold forward (01:18:10) quite recently
as well. Well, in fact we both filed forwards (01:18:14) amounting, accommodating €250
million, maturity at the end of September and a very good price.
So, let's say we hedge the transaction, we're quite comfortable. I don't want to have
additional surprises. I mean, the Brazilian real is in up and down mood and we consider
the most logical and reasonable decision to hedge this amount.

Okay. Thank you very much. There are two more questions. One is regarding ASISTENCIA.
ASISTENCIA expense ratio close to 40% due to fall of business volume. It looks structural.
What additional measures if there are any are you going to take to allocate the (01:19:07)
expense structure to the portfolio volume?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah, thank you, Pat. You're right. I mean, even in nominal numbers, (01:19:18) I think it was
last quarter but we disclosed as well a lot of contingency (01:19:23) plan for ASISTENCIA
with a lot of reductions in overhead. And what we've done is to move headquarters and
into MAPFRE'S headquarters in order to have more synergies among the different
overheads and also holding things. (01:19:48) We're pretty sure that we can reduce
overheads particularly those coming from external consultants and also to be more
efficient in the different administrative procedures.
We're monitoring this on a monthly basis and there is still some room for further decrease
in overheads. You're right. And also we have to look as well in the current capital levels in
ASISTENCIA because of the reduction in premiums and risk can give us an additional room
to optimize the current capital levels.

embedded value on a like-for-like basis and this is – yes, this is we saw the increase of the
scope that we have included for the first time in this business. Sylvia, what we can tell you
is that we can talk later on because we don't have the number right now with us. So we
can talk about that later on about this. So last one, last question it comes from Pat Ojeda
and regarding liquidity and dividends. If bank debt (01:21:11) €140 million on cash at the
holding has gone down to €15 million at the end of first half 2018 from €40 million at 2017
year and €50 million at first half 2017. And given the payments that need to be made like
Brazil transaction from España and BANKIA BMN agreement, what is the outlook for
dividends this year?

Thank you, Pat, you're right (01:21:48) and let's say if you look at the balance sheet there
are likely over €2 billion currently available at cash. Obviously, I mean this will spread
among the different operating insurance entities. There is not any cash restriction
currently in order to jeopardize the current outflow of dividends. You mentioned some
small transaction from España is just 4% of the currently shareholders' – I mean, it's not a
big amount. And also the remaining BANKIA BMN agreement, I mean these are still under
discussions and we do not see any particular date in order to have (01:22:39) this question
regarding this.
The different amounts (01:22:43) as well in the cash position basically is due to the
different outflow – inflow and outflow of dividends. And let's say that our dividend budget
made at the beginning of the year, I mean, is totally under control and there is no any risk
of the dividends to be jeopardized or be in risk because of the current transactions or any
announced potential increase in the future months.

Yes. Thank you everybody, I mean for joining us today. This has been the longest result
presentation since I took over. I think there were a lot of topics to be discussed. I guess
the majority of them they were answer. Just to add that we hope the information has
been interesting, I mean both included in the presentation and also in the speech. And
just remember that as every quarter, I mean there is a full set of documents in English
available in our website where you can get more information and more explanation
regarding our performance.
Hopefully, I mean we will see you next quarter and have a great summer, all of you. Thank
