Good morning. Welcome to Fairfax 2013 Second Quarter results conference call. Your
lines have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a
question-and-answer session.
(Operator Instructions)
For time's sake, we ask that you limit your questions to one. Today's conference is being
recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time. Your host for today's
call is Prem Watsa, with opening remarks from Paul Rivett. Sir, you may begin.

Good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss Fairfax's 2013 Second Quarter results. This
call may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ, perhaps materially,
from those contained in such forward-looking statements, as a result of a variety of
uncertainties and risk factors. The most foreseeable of which are set out under risk
factors in our base shelf prospectus filed with Canadian securities regulators. I now turn
the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Prem Watsa.

Thank you, Paul. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Fairfax's Second
Quarter conference call. I plan to give you some of the highlights, and then pass it on to
Dave Bonham, our CFO, for additional financial details. In the first six months of 2013,

book value per share decreased 1.6%, adjusted for the $10 per share dividend paid in the
First Quarter of 2013. We had a strong and much improved underwriting result in the
Second Quarter, and the first half of 2013 on increased premiums, while maintaining
disciplined underwriting. We are maintaining our defensive equity hedges as we continue
to remain concerned about the financial markets and the economic outlook. We continue
to be soundly financed with quarter-end cash and marketable securities at the holding
company in excess of $1.2 billion.
Net premiums written by the Company's insurance and reinsurance operations in the
Second Quarter of 2013, increased by 1.6% after adjusting for a large property quota
share reinsurance contract at OdysseyRe. The combined ratio for our insurance and
reinsurance operations in 2013 was 94.2% for the Second Quarter and 94.1% for the first
half. At the subsidiary level, net premiums written in quarter two 2013 and combined
ratios were as follows. OdysseyRe, after adjusting for the quota share contract, are up
8.1% with a 85.9% combined ratio. Crum & Forster, premiums were down 9.7% or close to
10%, with 102.1% combined ratio. Crum & Forster had a decrease in premiums because of
re-underwriting done on standard lines in the second half of 2012. Northbridge was up
5.2% with 100.4% combined ratio. Zenith up 15.2% with a 95.6% combined ratio.
This is the First Quarter Zenith had a combined ratio below 100% since we acquired it in
2010, reflecting significant rate increases and some reserve redundancies. Fairfax Asia
was up 10% and had a 90.7% combined ratio. We continue to grow depending on the
Company. As we have said before, very low interest rates and the reduced reserve
redundancies, means there's no place to hide for the industry. Combined ratios have to
drop well below 100% for the industry to make a single-digit return on equity with these
low rates. While the short term is always tough to predict, fundamentals will eventually
play out.
Net investment losses of $415.7 million in the Second Quarter of 2013, consisted of the
following. Please note table on page two of our press release. Net gains on equity and
equity-related investments of $71 million was after a small loss on our equity hedge. After
unrealized mark-to-market bond losses of $496 million, $16 million in unrealized CPI-linked
derivative losses, and other gains of $26 million, we had a net loss of $415.7 million -- all
unrealized. Because of rising interest rates in the quarter, we had approximately $500
million in unrealized mark-to-market bond losses, which consisted of $400 million from
state and muni bonds, a majority of which are insured by Berkshire Hathaway, and
approximately $100 million from long US Treasuries. We consider these unrealized bond
losses as fluctuations and expect them to reverse over time.
Our muni bond portfolio was mainly acquired in the last quarter of 2008 at an after-tax
yield of 5.79%. Realized gains from stocks and bonds during the quarter were $171.4
million, and $336.7 million in the six months of 2013. The Company held in excess, as I said
before, of $1.2 billion of cash, short-term investments and marketable securities at the
holding company level at June 30, 2013. Finally, we continue to be approximately 100%
hedged in relationship to our equity and equity-related securities, which include
convertible bonds and convertible preferred stock. Any movements above or below 100%
are balanced in the following quarter. We continue to be very concerned about the

prospects for the financial markets and the economies of North America and Western
Europe, accentuated, as we have said before, by potential weakness in China.
As we have said now for some time, there continues to be a big disconnect between the
financial markets and the underlying economic fundamentals. As of June 30, 2013, we
have over 29% or $7.5 billion in cash and short-term investments in our portfolios to take
advantage of opportunities that come our way. In the short term, our investment income
will be reduced. Now, I would like to turn it over to Dave so he can give you some more
information on the underlying financials. Dave?

Thank you, Prem. First, I'll focus on Fairfax's consolidated results for the Second Quarter of
2013, and then I'll move on to the operating Company results, and, finally, finish up with
the consolidated financial position. For the Second Quarter of 2013, Fairfax reported a net
loss of $158 million, or a net loss of $8.55 per share on a fully diluted basis. That compares
to the Second Quarter of 2012, when we reported net earnings of $94 million, or net
earnings of $3.79 per share on a fully diluted basis. On a year-to-date basis, the Company
reported net earnings of $4 million, that translated into a net loss of $1.32 per diluted
share in the first half of 2013, and the net loss on a per-share basis results because
earnings per share is calculated after deducting preferred share dividends.
That compares to net earnings of $91 million in the first half of 2012, or $3.04 per fully
diluted share. Our underwriting results have shown significant improvement in the first half
of 2013. In the Second Quarter and first six months, our insurance and reinsurance
operations reported combined ratios slightly above 94%, and our underwriting profit was
$84 million, and $170 million during those respective periods. Our combined ratios in the
Second Quarter and first six months of 2012, were approximately 98%, and our
underwriting profits were $33 million and $49 million during those respective periods. So
that's about a 4-point improvement in the combined ratio year over year, which reflects, in
2013, increased net favorable development of prior year's reserves, partially offset by
higher catastrophe losses.
In terms of reserve development, we experienced $106 million and $142 million of net
favorable development prior year's reserves in the Second Quarter and first six months of
2013. And that benefited our combined ratio by 7 points and 5 points during those
respective periods. In the Second Quarter and first six months of 2012, we experienced
approximately $50 million of net favorable development, which benefited our combined
ratio by 4 points and 2 points, respectively. Excluding the benefit of net favorable
development, our accident year combined ratios were 101.6% and 99% in the Second
Quarter and first six months of 2013, and that compared to 101.2% and 100.1% in the
Second Quarter and first six months of 2012. In the Second Quarter of 2013, we also had
catastrophe losses of just under $112 million, and that added about 8 points to the Second
Quarter combined ratio.
In the first half of 2013, we had catastrophe losses of $144 million, and that accounted for
5 points on the combined ratio in the first six months of 2013. As mentioned by Prem
already, net premiums written by our insurance and reinsurance operations increased in

the Second Quarter and first half of 2013 by 1.6% and 3.6%, prior to giving effect to two
unearned premium portfolio transfers at OdysseyRe, related to a specific quota share
reinsurance contract. I wanted to note for you that page 39 of our Second Quarter interim
report contains a detailed discussion of these transactions, including their impact on
OdysseyRe and on Fairfax in general. Now turning to our operating Company results and
we'll start with OdysseyRe, in the Second Quarter and first six months of 2013, Odyssey
reported underwriting profits of $79 million and $174 million, and combined ratios of 85.9%
and 84.4%.
Underwriting profit in the Second Quarter of 2013 was comparable to the underwriting
profit in the same period in the prior year, but reflected higher net favorable
development of prior year's reserves, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses.
Underwriting profit in the first half of 2013 increased by about $37 million, principally
reflecting higher net favorable development of prior year's reserves. Catastrophe losses
in the Second Quarter and first six months of 2013 of $57 million and $89 million added 10
points and 8 points to the combined ratios of OdysseyRe in those respective periods.
And that was higher than the catastrophe losses of $31 million and $54 million in the
Second Quarter and first six months of 2012. The flooding in central Europe and the
flooding in Alberta reduced OdysseyRe's underwriting profit by $23 million and $15 million,
respectively, in each of the Second Quarter and first six months of 2013, as these were
both Second Quarter events.
OdysseyRe's combined ratio in the Second Quarter and first six months 2013 included the
benefit of $36 million, or 7 points, and $54 million, or 5 points, of net favorable
development of prior year's reserves, principally related to net favorable emergence on
prior year's catastrophe losses. OdysseyRe wrote $502 million of net premiums in the
Second Quarter of 2013, down from $620 million in the Second Quarter of 2012. That's a
decrease of 19.1%, or about $119 million. The decrease of $119 million included the effect of
the two significant unearned premium portfolio transfers, one inwards transfer, which
occurred in the Second Quarter of 2012, and another outwards transfer in the Second
Quarter of 2013. They both related to a significant Florida quota share reinsurance
contract. Without these portfolio transfers, net premiums written increased by 7.8% and
11.4% in the Second Quarter and first six months of 2013. And for more details, please see
page 54 of our Second Quarter interim report.
Moving on to Crum & Forster. Crum & Forster's underwriting results on a year-over-year
basis improved modestly in the Second Quarter of 2013, and with a more noticeable
improvement in the first six months of 2013. And that's on lower operating expenses,
higher net premiums earned, and the absence of net adverse reserve development in
2013, whereas the first six months of 2012 included 1 combined ratio point, or $5 million of
net adverse development of prior year's reserves. Crum & Forster reported underwriting
losses of about $6 million in each of the Second Quarter and first six months of 2013, and
that compared to underwriting losses of $7 million and $22 million in the Second Quarter
and first six months of 2012. Current period catastrophe losses had a nominal impact on
Crum & Forster's combined ratios, which were 102.1% in the Second Quarter, and 100.9%
in the first six months of 2013. Net premiums written by Crum & Forster in the Second
Quarter and first six months of 2013 decreased by 9.7% and 7.7%, primarily reflecting
lower standard lines gross premiums written, specifically a reduction in workers'

compensation business, and that was partially offset by higher specialty lines and gross
premiums written.
Zenith reported significant improvements in its combined ratio, which decreased from
116.4% and 117% in the Second Quarter and first six months of 2012, to 95.6% and 102.6%
in the Second Quarter and first six months of 2013. The improvements reflected the
following -- year-over-year decreases of 11 and 8 points in the accident year loss ratios in
the Second Quarter and first six months of 2013, and that reflected earned premium price
increases that were in excess of estimates of loss trends; secondly, net favorable
development of prior year's reserves of 6 and 3 points in the Second Quarter and first six
months of 2013, and that development primarily related to the 2012 accident year; and,
finally, decreases in the expense ratio of 4 points and 3 points in the Second Quarter and
first six months of 2013, and that was as a result of 16% and 14% increases in net
premiums earned year over year.
Net premiums written by Zenith of $144 million and $430 million in the Second Quarter
and first six months of 2013, increased year over year by 15% and 13% reflecting premium
rate increases. Northbridge also reported a significant improvement in its combined
ratios, which decreased from 106% and 105% in the Second Quarter and first six months
of 2012, to 100.4% in each of the Second Quarter and first six months of 2013. The
improvement in the first half of 2013 reflected increased net favorable development of
prior year's reserves, partially offset by higher year-over-year current period catastrophe
losses. Northbridge's combined ratio included the benefit of net favorable development
of prior year's reserves across most accident years and lines of business, of $54 million,
or 22 points, in the Second Quarter of 2013, and $62 million, or 13 points, in the first half of
2013. And that compared to net favorable development of $21 million, or 9 points, and $27
million, or 5 points, in the Second Quarter and first half of 2012.
Catastrophe losses in the Second Quarter and first six months of 2013 of $34 million
related to the Alberta floods, and added 14 and 7 points to the combined ratios during
those respective periods. In contrast, catastrophe losses in the Second Quarter and first
six months of 2012 were approximately $6 million, and added 2.1 and 1.3 points to the
combined ratios during those periods. After adjusting for the impact of the inter-company
unearned premium portfolio transfer between Northbridge and group Re that we
described in the First Quarter and which is explained in more detail on page 47 of our
Second Quarter interim report, net premiums written by Northbridge increased by 4.7%
and 5.4% in the Second Quarter and first six months of 2013, reflecting modest growth in
writings at Federated and Northbridge insurance, and increased premium retention
following the termination of that inter-company quota share reinsurance contract. Fairfax
Asia's combined ratio increased modestly from 88.8% and 90.4% in the Second Quarter
and first six months of 2012, to 90.7% and 90.9% in the Second Quarter and first six
months of 2013.
Net premiums written by Fairfax Asia increased by 10% and 6.9% on a year-over-year
basis in the Second Quarter and first six months of 2013, principally as a result of
increased writings of property and workers' compensation lines of business, and that was
partially offset by a reduction in writings related to Marine Hall. The combined ratios of the
insurance and reinsurance other division improved from 100.7% in the Second Quarter of
Page 5 of 12

FINAL

2012 to 100.2% in the Second Quarter of 2013, and improved from 101.7% in the first six
months of 2012 to 99.3% in the first six months of 2013. Runoff reported pretax losses of
$129 million and $143 million in the Second Quarter and first six months of 2013. That
compared to pretax profits of $79 million and $132 million in the same periods in the prior
year. The year-over-year decrease in profitability primarily related to net investment
losses in the Second Quarter of 2013.
A gain on a significant reinsurance commutation partially offset by net reserve
development in US runoff also contributed to runoff's pretax result in the first six months
of 2013. Our consolidated interest and dividend income increased from $106 million in the
Second Quarter of 2012 to $112 million in the Second Quarter of 2013. The increase
primarily reflected lower total return swap expenses as a result of the timing of a dividend
payable on a short equity index total return swap derivative contract that was partially
offset by lower investment income earned. The effect of lower investment income earned
in the first half of 2013 was more pronounced, and resulted in a decrease in our interest
and dividend income from $235 million in the first half 2012 to $212 million in the first half
2013.
Rounding out our review of the income statement, the Company recorded a recovery of
income taxes of $150 million, and $202 million in the Second Quarter and first half of 2013.
The effective tax rates implicit in these recoveries of income taxes are higher than our
statutory tax rates for two main reasons. The first, we incurred significant pretax losses in
the US where tax may be recovered at the 35% statutory income tax rate in the US, and
that's a substantially higher rate than the Canadian statutory rate of 26%. And secondly,
we continue to receive a considerable amount of non-taxable investment income in the
form of interest income on our US municipal bonds, inter-corporate dividends on common
stocks, and certain net capital gains in Canada, where 50% of the gain is not taxable.
For further details, I will draw your attention to note 14 on pages 20 and 21 of our Second
Quarter interim report, where in addition to our customary income tax rate reconciliation,
we have added a table showing the breakdown of our pretax earnings and losses by
jurisdiction and the tax provision attributable to each of those jurisdictions. We ended the
quarter with an investment portfolio which included holding company cash and
investments of $25.2 billion compared to $26.1 billion at the end of 2012. A significant
portion of the decrease related to the effect of foreign currency translation vis-a-vis the
strengthening of the US dollar, relative to many of the currencies in which Fairfax's non-US
dollar investments are denominated, as well as the unrealized depreciation on the
Company's bond portfolio.
Moving to our financial position, our total debt to total capital ratio increased to 27% from
25.5% at December 31, 2012, due primarily to additional debt issued net of repurchases in
the First Quarter of 2013, and the decrease in our common shareholders equity during
the first six months of 2013. We have $183 million of OdysseyRe debt maturing in the fall
of 2013, which we funded by the issuance of debt in the First Quarter of 2013. After
repayment of the OdysseyRe debt in November, on a pro forma basis, our debt-tocapital ratio is expected to return to approximately 25.8%. Now, I'll pass it back over to
you Prem.

Thank you, Dave. Now, we'll be happy to answer your questions. Please give us your
name, your company name, and try to limit your questions to only one so that it's fair to all
on the call. Okay, Theresa, we are ready for the questions.

Questions And Answers

Jeff Fenwick, Cormark Securities.

Q - Jeff Fenwick

{BIO 15350794 <GO>}

Prem, I wanted to focus my questions in on the US P&C area. Obviously some clear signs
of hardening in different parts of the market down there. That's benefited Zenith in
particular. I wanted to ask you about Crum. Crum has been going through looks like a
transition towards more specialty lines and that's making it tough to grow premiums
overall. When do you think that process is complete and do you get a sense that it's
positioned to benefit from some of the hardening that we're seeing today in the US?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Jeff, that's a good question. Crum as I said re-underwrote bids, particularly its workers
comp and standard lines in the second half of 2012. So as we go into the second half
you're going to see an improvement. I'd say you're exactly right when you say they're
transitioning from standard lines to specialty lines. We are also being careful on the
excess and surplus lines, making sure that we're -- that's it's a profitable business. So I'd
say in the next -- as long as the market conditions remain, that we would see some
growth in the six months to a year. The marketplace, it's not a traditional hard market. But
there's 5% or 10% price increases broadly available. Property prices, particularly exposed
to catastrophe, are down of course from very high levels. But we see Crum continuing to
expand in the specialty lines area.

Q - Jeff Fenwick

{BIO 15350794 <GO>}

And I guess Prem, along with that, you're seeing I think some opportunities to grow
through M&A. And you announced your agreement with ASI in the quarter. That was
followed up with a bid from another player at a higher level. What's the process from
here? Does ASI take that -- that goes back to the board to deliberate, can you just
elaborate on what the steps are going forward from here?

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Yes. What happens is that -- that just came on Friday, of course, Jeff. So what happens is
the Board has to deliberate on this offer. They have to get a firm offer of course, and then

Page 7 of 12



Company N ame: Fairfax Financial H oldings L td
Company Ticker: FFH CN Equity
Date: 2013-08-02

they have to contact us. From our standpoint, and as you would expect, we're reviewing
all our options and we'll just wait for the Board to get back to us.

FINAL

Q - Jeff Fenwick

{BIO 15350794 <GO>}

And anything broadly speaking, do you think there's perhaps some other M&A
opportunities in the US market here, just with things not quite back on -- on a hard market
yet, is that still an area where you may see some other opportunities.

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Jeff, over 28 years, I've said this to you before, you never can tell when these
opportunities come. We bought the Hartville as you know, pet insurance company. If you
had asked me a year ago, I probably wouldn't have been able to say that, that would have
happened or American Safety. So we are opportunistic and we look at opportunities as
they come our way. But as I said before, we've got a very diversified book of business.
Globally diversified. And we have extremely good management running our Companies.
So in the proper environment we have -- which means prices are going up, we have the
ability to expand significantly. So we don't need to do any acquisitions. We like where we
are. And we'll wait for -- we're long-term in our thinking, long-term in building our
Company, and so we'll react to opportunity when it comes our way.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Prem, I wanted to ask you on the reinsurance side, it looks like the July 1 renewals were a
little bit soft. And looks like that's an important period for Odyssey based on the
seasonality of its premiums written. So wondering what your experience was with
Odyssey with respect to the July 1 renewals.

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

First of all, Paul, Odyssey's got a worldwide spread of business. It's got many, many dials
that it can move up or move down. The property side, the prices have come down 10%,
15%, maybe a little more, and this is cat exposed property business. So as you'd expect,
Odyssey is writing less of it. Still profitable but writing less of it. But the other business is
holding steady and they've had excellent combined ratios and we like where Odyssey
Re's positioned Paul.

Thanks. One additional question. Following the flood losses in Canada, both Alberta and
Toronto, some of your competitors are indicating that maybe we should expect a
hardening of rates in the primary property market. Is that consistent with what you would
expect at Northbridge?

FINAL

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Yes. If history's any guide, when you have these significant losses, and the numbers have
yet to come out in terms of being firm for Alberta, but might well be the biggest loss
we've had in Canada, and when you have these type of losses then prices have to go up
to make up. Many, many companies will have significant losses. We had our share as
we've disclosed to you both at the Northbridge level as well as at the Odyssey level. So I
think you'll see re-insurers raising their rates and eventually the primary companies will do
the same. That's just historically what happens.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

Operator
Tom McGinn, BMO capital.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Tom McGinn

{BIO 20541399 <GO>}

A question with respect to Crum. Seems like the premiums are going down due to a
reduction in workers comp and then you go to Zenith and they're going up because you
get an increase in workers comp. Are you just trying to write more of the overall Fairfax
business in Zenith instead of Crum? What's necessarily happening there?

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

I think Zenith is getting price increases. If you look at Zenith's business, they'll tell you that
some of the areas like Los Angeles are very, very competitive and they wouldn't be
writing business there. Their combined ratios in Los Angeles for Zenith would be above
100% and they make up in other areas. So what Crum's doing is just getting off areas
where they think combined ratios are much higher and it's similar to what Zenith is doing.
So it's not different from what Zenith's doing.
But Zenith is a specialized insurance Company in California, has been doing that for a long
time and Zenith's price increases now in California have been very significant. But even
Zenith you'll note, Tom, have increases that's equal to rate increases. So there's not a lot
of volume above the rate increases. So Zenith is very careful as they get these price
increases. Their renewal rates are very high, in excess of 90%. But they're not writing a lot
of new business because the business has been priced at very low rates and so they're
very sensitive to getting appropriate rate increases before they expand and -- but they
are expanding. Their combined ratios are 95% in the quarter, 95.6% in the quarter, but
they're basically running around 100% if you take out the reserve redundancies that we
had in the Second Quarter.

Q - Tom McGinn

{BIO 20541399 <GO>}

And I noticed that Zenith has traditionally been a contributor to hold co capital but in this
quarter I think you put capital into Zenith. What's the reason behind that?

FINAL

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

We just put a little, Tom, $10 million, just in terms of keeping levels at where we think was
appropriate. But Zenith has enough capital and the capital models have risk charges for all
sorts of items which we figure by the end of the year will normalize. At any point in time,
we might have to contribute $10 million or $5 million or whatever and then we normalize it.
Because there's lots of charges for the regulatory models and once we get a sense for
that, those charges, then we normalize it. But wasn't significant and Zenith is wellcapitalized and we expect Zenith -- if the opportunity continues, we'll write a lot more
business.

Q - Tom McGinn

{BIO 20541399 <GO>}

Finally, if I could just squeeze one more with the ASI and the counter bid, would you be
able to share with us any of the -- I don't know if there's any potential break fees
associated with the deal or the complexities involved because I believe you are selling a
piece then of ASI to the Tower Group. How does that fit into this process?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Prem Watsa

Break fees are, Tom, quite simple, as disclosed in the proxy. It's 9 million, 9.5 million in that
area. There's 10 million shares outstanding so it's about $1 a share. That's what it is. This
came out on Friday and so as I said earlier that we are reviewing our options and looking
at what the possibilities are.

Question I wanted to ask about was related to the CPI linked derivative contracts. The
notional amount outstanding on that has increased 50% from year end. It's now reached
the point where it's really double the size of the overall balance sheet. I understand the
concept of protecting the balance sheet. I guess what I'm interested in understanding
more about is the size of the notional position because it kind of ceases to be a hedge, it
starts becoming kind of a directional call. And I was wondering if you could talk about that
a little bit.

We have about $523 million invested in it, at cost, I think at market it's a fraction, like $120
million, something like that, it is a fraction. And it's got eight years to go. It has eight years
to go, and in nominal terms it's about as you pointed out $75 billion, but of course you'll
never get $75 billion. That means 100% loss, right. We figure maybe 5% or 10% in the
extreme case, not 100%. So you can't compare that $75 billion to our total assets. Half of
it is US, half of it is European. It's an -- we think of it as, Mark, like what we're thinking today
and I'll just highlight it for all of you on the call, we said it before, there's a big disconnect
between financial markets and economic fundamentals. So what do I mean economic
fundamentals?
You look at the stock market, you think things are -- the economy is roaring along. Look at
the First Quarter of 2013 for the United States. The first number, GDP, came out at 2.4%,
revised down to 1.8%, ultimately revised down to 1.1%. Quarter four 2012 came out at
0.4%, revised down to 0.1%, basically flat. The last five quarters on average are at 1.4%.
Each quarter. So that means it's a very tepid economic growth and on top of that you have
-- if you take core inflation, excluding energy and food, it's the lowest in 50 years.
Now, you look at these two facts and think about the fact that you've had QE1, QE2, QE3,
and you've had huge stimulus in the United States, and you've had such weak growth and
no inflation to speak of. Now, if the economy stumbles or if China has a problem and
there's all sorts of concerns about China as you all know, and Europe continues to be
flattish, we worry about things like that and we worry as we said to you for some time
about deflation. Everyone's worried about inflation and have been worried for five years.
Remember two things, and we've said that in our annual meeting. One, it took five years
for deflation to set to come in Japan. After the bubble broke in 1989, it was 1995 that
deflation set up, began, and then for the next 17 out of 18 years you had deflation in
Japan.
And the second is just because we're all here very big fans of Ben Graham. Ben Graham
said in 1925 -- in the '30s he said, after the crash, after the Depression took hold, that if
you want bearish in 1925, it was a 1 in 100 chance you would survived the Depression, 1 in
100 chance. If you went bearish long before 1929, meaning 1925, there's was a very small
chance you survived. So we are very concerned. We don't take this lightly. We're watching
it very, very carefully. If we had a hedge we'd make another $500 million something like
that. We could easily buy corporate bonds. We've been in the business for 40 years and
we're stepping away. We think we're not being paid for risk so we're stepping away from
the marketplace. I'll remind you that in 2008, 2009 when the stock markets were down
we were fully invested and when spreads were wide we bought corporate bonds and we
bought all sorts of bonds.
But today, we think there's a significant amount of risk and we think you have to be very,
very careful and there's all sorts of unintended consequences in the marketplace,
because of what's happening in the United States particularly but perhaps elsewhere. And
so this is our way of protecting ourselves like we did with our credit default swaps and just
being very, very careful.
