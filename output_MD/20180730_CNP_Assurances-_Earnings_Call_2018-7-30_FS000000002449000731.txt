Bloomberg Transcript

Frédéric Lavenir
Good morning. Frédéric Lavenir speaking. Thank you for being here for our First Half
Results Presentation. Well, you got our press release this morning, so you know the main
ﬁgures, and I think you can follow my presentation on the slideshow you have on the
screen. Yes.
So on page 5, for a short introduction about the main ﬁgures and main performance. I
think this ﬁrst half is a good period for our company. Our ﬁnancial results are improving
with a 2.3% growth of our net proﬁt, almost 8% [Technical Diﬃculty] (00:01:00-00:01:16).
Is it okay? Yes. Is it working? Yeah, I can speak. So, I'm sorry. We had a technical problem,
but I think it's solved now.
Well, I was speaking about the growth of our EBIT by almost 8%, and quite good growth
of our operating free cash ﬂow by almost 30% for this ﬁrst semester. So, those metrics are
based on very sound business momentum. We can illustrate through a few ﬁgures which
are on the top of this page 5. The business mix is continuing to improve. The unit-linked
contracts represent now 42% of our savings and pensions premiums, which is far from our
situation a few years ago and continuing to improve.
Our combined ratio in the risk and protection business is quite good with 81%. And
consequence of the improvement of the business mix and good level of the combined
ratio, the APE margin is growing to 25.3% (sic) [24.3%] (00:02:47), which is, I think, the
best ﬁgure we ever had. So, it's a sound basis for good ﬁnancial metrics and it allows us to

conﬁrm our objective of an at least 5% organic growth in the EBIT in 2018. We already
announced as an objective. This is a good dynamic.
And, now, page 6 [Technical Diﬃculty] (00:03:17-00:03:47).

Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, sorry for this technical issue. We will invite you to please hold the
line. We will be right back. Thank you.
[Technical Diﬃculty] (00:03:56-00:08:33).
Ladies and gentlemen, we are very sorry for this technical issue. The conference will
resume. Gentlemen, please go ahead.

Okay. So, I hope there is still somebody on the line. So, if there is somebody, I start again
and I'm really sorry for this technical problem, but I think it's now really solved, not only
temporarily, and we will have no more incidents during the presentation.
So, I was – page 6 – I went to page 6, saying that this strong earnings momentum was –
had been hit by the currency eﬀect. You can see it on page 6, with a very good evolution
of the net insurance revenue, a positive change in revenues from the own-funds portfolio,
good control and monitoring of the administrative costs, and a very strong currency
eﬀect. Despite this currency eﬀect, so I repeat, our EBIT grew by almost 8%, which is quite
good ﬁgure.
And, now, we will, as usually, go to detailed presentation of the results and performance
geography by geography and I will leave Antoine doing that starting with France.

Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

Hello. We are now on page 8 of the presentation to start with France. We've an
improvement in APE margins and product mix. As you see, premium income was slightly
down this half year, with growth in unit-linked business decreasing traditional savings and
pension business, and speciﬁcally technical decrease in risk and protection which is due
to another classiﬁcation of some of our activities. All in all, APE margin of business in
France was up at 24.7% during this period.
If we now come to page 9, you observe a very strong revenue growth, which is due to
better business mix of our sales, higher unit-linked technical reserves, also an improved
loss ratios in the employee beneﬁts segment, which is a result of constant negotiation and
improvement of our relations with our partners in this business and good sales of term
creditor insurance in spite of new regulation, which was not to repeat (00:11:34) in favor of
bank insurance, but nevertheless, we passed the period with a growth of term creditor

FINAL

insurance revenues. We have also posted higher revenues from our own-fund portfolios.
This all results in an increase of 8.8% in total revenue in France.
If we come now to page 10, you see that administrative costs were slightly higher than last
year. In fact, if we discard reclassiﬁcation of some of our cost which did not ﬁgure in this
category before, we are, in fact, exactly at the same level as last year and the cost/income
ratio is still decreasing compared to last year and to last years in general. We are in
constant process of decreasing this cost-to-income ratio. Now, you see also that EBIT
growth due to two aforementioned evolutions is growing very quickly by 11% from last
year and is above €1 billion in the ﬁrst half of 2018.
Now, let's come to Latin American business on page 11. We have a very sharp increase of
premium income. The like-for-like ﬁgures shows an increase of 37.2% in local currency.
They are led mainly by very strong growth in pensions and term creditor insurance, you
see for instance, but pensions is growing by 56% here.

Bloomberg Transcript

We have APE margin at 27.5%, slight decrease in terms of margin due to the proportion of
pension business which is higher than before in our business mix. And the value of new
business in fact in like-for-like ﬁgures would be slightly higher than last year's, but it was,
of course, reduced by the 20% decrease of value of real meantime (00:14:07). Let's notice
the fact that Caixa Seguradora market share is now above 10%, 10.2%, up from 7.8% last
year. Then, a very good economic and commercial performance.
Among the diﬀerent satisfactions we have, you see on page 12 the performance of our
digital subsidiary, Youse, which accounted BRL 400 million (00:14:41) written premium
after two years and has now 150,000 active policies in the period. Then, it is constant
development of this subsidiary since the beginning in May 2016.
On page 13, you have a view on the revenues in Brazil. You see that the like-for-like
ﬁgures, which incorporates the – which do not incorporate the decrease of real, are up by
9.2%, with a very strong growth of insurance revenues, meaning personal risk and saving
pension net insurance revenue and a slight decrease of our revenues from own-funds,
which is attributable to a decrease of interest rates in Brazil.
For administrative costs, they were slightly above last year's. We have exposed IT
investments over the period and it results all in all in an EBIT which change like-for-like is
plus 8.5% at €446 million, plus eﬀect of like-for-like of a decrease of the real.
If we come now to page 14, we have activities in Europe with a very, very important
increase in premium income, plus 41.3%. And you see there that this increase is
attributable to the three parts of our activities there. We have an increase – the main part
in terms of premium income comes from sales in unit-linked which grew by 44%. We have
also an increase with traditional savings and pension business by 74% and a constant
growth in personal risk and protection activity which is due to our partnership with
Santander.

Page 3 of 16



Company Name: CNP Assurances

FINAL

These results are compounded by the increase of Santander as already mentioned and
also by the new partnership agreement with UniCredit which helped together to increase
the unit-linked sales and to increase better quality pension traditional – savings in pension
traditional businesses and better technical basis.
All together, that results in an increase new business value which stays now at €36 million
and a slight decrease of net APE margin decrease being, of course, attributable to the fact
that increase in premium income is made of savings businesses which are of less interest
in terms of APE margin than risk and protection.
If you say on page 15, revenues of our company in Europe or France, these revenues
decreased slightly in savings and pension net insurance revenue. This decrease is
attributable to the new agreements which we have with UniCredit. You know that we
disclosed the fact that now we have an agreement which incorporates an extra
commission during three ﬁrst years in order to pay the new agreement and to replace an
upfront payment which was made before in the former agreement.

Bloomberg Transcript

Please note there also that personal risk and protection net insurance revenue increased
over the period. The administrative costs are relatively stable if we accept the natural
growth of Santander and EBIT is, of course, damaged little by – dented little by the new
agreement with UniCredit and the payment of an extra commission this half year.
If we come now to the further elements on the ﬁnancial performance on page 17, starting
by review of EBIT at the end of the half year, €1.5 billion roughly, with major part of EBIT
being represented by personal risk and protection business. We have also ﬁnancial costs
which were slightly below last year, and income tax expenses which grew a little bit, but
last year was marked by some economies in taxation in Brazil, the equity accounted and
non-controlling interest which were marked by negative currency eﬀects in Brazil, and also
by new equity accounted interest regarding GRTgaz, which is participation we made in a
distribution company in France. The fair value adjustments and net gains and losses, as
well as non-recurring items are roughly at the same level as last year, and all that results in
an attributable net proﬁt of €672 million.
If you look now on page 18 at net operating free cash ﬂow, it amounts to €809 million
coming from last year – and €624 million last year. This is sum of diﬀerent elements. The
operating revenue is at €720 million, up by 8.5%, roughly growth of EBIT. The release of
required capital amounted to €283 million, up to last year's – release was lower last year
for diﬀerent reasons linked to assumptions in biometric and behavioral measurements.
And the required capital for new business is lower than last year. It is linked to the fact that
then VNB rise was very sharp, and in itself the VNB is ﬁnancing the growth of the capital.
But all results in a net operating cash ﬂow – free cash ﬂow at €809 million, which is much
better than last year.
If we come now to balance sheet view of our Solvency II coverage ratio, it stays now at
198%, which is 8% above last – at the end of last year. There are diﬀerent reasons to this
increase. One of the reasons is that we now take into account an issue of Tier 1
subordinated note which was made in June. It represents 4% out of this 198%. As we think

Page 4 of 16



Company Name: CNP Assurances
Company Ticker: CNP FP Equity
Date: 2018-07-30

FINAL

that we will make redemption of an existing Tier 1 by the end of the year, you can consider
that this 4% will disappear in a way by the end of the year and that increase without this
element is about 4% increase due to revenues made of the company. You see that capital
is improving whereas SCR remains stable to last year's SCR.
We also want on page 20 to highlight the robust position recognized by ﬁnancial rating
agencies of CNP itself. We have same rating as last year's from Standard & Poor's, A with
stable outlook and it was conﬁrmed in April 2018. And as you know, we have a ﬁrst-time
rating granted by Moody's, which is A1 with stable outlook. And the two agencies based
their proﬁle opinion of solvency of CNP on diﬀerent elements which were reminded in this
slide.
We are also – one further and last for me – element in this presentation on page 21 which
is very important, with regard to our commitment in term of environmental investment.
You see there diﬀerent visions of grades we get from diﬀerent agencies on our
environmental investments, all that to say that we attribute very great and growing
importance in this criteria when we choose our investment. We consider the role of the
company which balance sheet is above €400 billion is clearly to impose an evolution of a
business model of companies in which we invest, either on equities and in bonds, and we
follow very speciﬁcally the views by the diﬀerent rating agencies on that respect.

Bloomberg Transcript

Frédéric Lavenir
A short conclusion, Frédéric Lavenir speaking again, on page 22. To underline, that's – our
strategy is continuing to create value on a long-term basis. You notice that our balance
sheet is changing. Our technical reserves are slowly, but constantly changing in structure
with more unit-linked and less traditional euro, technical reserves which means more
proﬁtable savings business and also less capital-consuming balance sheet.
You'll also notice that our revenue structure is changing with now a preeminence of risk
and protection business, which leads to a more proﬁtable, but also more diversiﬁed and
more resilient business mix. And last but not least, you'll notice that we continue to
improve our operational eﬃciency through a very positive evolution of our cost/income
ratio which is continuing to improve year after year. Altogether that means a much better
margin rate, APE margin which reaches now very, very good level in Europe as well as in
Southern America. And at the end, really value-creating strategy, page 22, with MCEV per
share which grew by almost 75% in the past six years.
And I want to insist on another ﬁgure which is on page 22, which is as important as the
ﬁnancial ﬁgures, which is the teqCO2 per euro invested, which is now 0.28 teqCO2 by
thousands of euro invested – sorry, 28 with an objective of 0.25%. We think at CNP that
our long-term growth is linked to the success of pro-climate strategy because we are on
the long term for our corporate strategy and it's based on the long-term vision on the
environment in which we are working and everybody is committed in this strategy. And I
see around me here people who are really committed in that. So, I think it's another very
important point.

at your disposal, available for your questions, comments about those ﬁgures. Thank you
very much.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. First question is from David Barma from Exane. Please go ahead.

Q - David Barma

{BIO 21843622 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. My ﬁrst one will be on slide 38 of
your presentation, the conversion of the new business into future proﬁts. Thank you for
that slide. And I was wondering if you'd be able to give us some color on how the €720
million number changed compared to last year or the year before and how the
development of the curve evolved in order to understand the impact of your
improvements in the business mix.

Bloomberg Transcript

My second question would be on slide 26 with the breakdown of the net new money for
French savings, and I was wondering how the slide will look like (00:30:58) protection
and especially the evolution of surrenders and death beneﬁt.
And my last one would be on Brazil and your overall development strategy, if the
distribution agreements in Brazil is renewed under terms of last year's MOU, I was
wondering what we can expect in terms of strategy to make up for the loss of earnings in
that area. It will be through a greater focus on French protection or trying to ﬁnd
alternatives in LatAm or developments elsewhere in Europe? Thank you.

A - Frédéric Lavenir
Sorry. I didn't hear your fourth question because – well – could you repeat it, please?

Q - David Barma

{BIO 21843622 <GO>}

Yeah, sorry. The last one was on Brazil and if the distribution agreement is renewed on the
terms of the MOU of last year, what we can expect – how we can expect your make up for
the loss of earnings of the parts of the business which is not included in the MOU and if
we can expect that to come through more focus on French protection for example or
trying to ﬁnd alternatives in Brazil or LatAm or developments elsewhere in Europe?

A - Frédéric Lavenir
Okay. Sorry. No, I heard the question. I thought you had a fourth question. But I'll answer
the last one myself and I'll give the word to Antoine for your second question and to our
CFO, Thomas Béhar, for the ﬁrst question.
So, the last question is about our strategy in Brazil. So, I can conﬁrm we are continuing to
negotiate with our Brazilian friends. As you know, we had change in the governance of
Page 6 of 16



Company Name: CNP Assurances

FINAL

our partner Caixa in last April. So, it led to a few changes in the management, et cetera,
but we are now again in a very, very positive move towards agreement.
So, I don't have anything to add to what we said a few weeks or month ago. It is taking
some times. And of course, as we announced the MOU last September, we expected
quicker end of the negotiation, but it's going very well in the – exactly the same – in the
same frame. So, what we issued last September continue to be exactly the framework in
which we are working. I cannot give any limit, but we really hope to go quick now and it's
going very well.
About the change in our strategy, as you can see in our ﬁgures in Brazil, business is
growing very, very well, better than ever. And we hope it will continue to grow better than
ever. We expect no signiﬁcant change in our business mix, except, of course, depending
on the way the excluded products as you remained – and it's right, there are few products
which are excluded of the scope we are negotiating now.
So, it's not possible to know exactly now what will happen with those new products after
signing or closing of our new deal, but we hope to continue to work on some of those
products. What I can say is that most proﬁtable products in Brazil now are in the scope of
the future exclusivity, which is in negotiation now. So, we will continue to develop. As you
know, we have projects in Brazil and outside Brazil, including Colombia and continue to
work in Argentina. So, our development strategy in Southern America in the whole scope
of business has no reason to change in the coming years.

Bloomberg Transcript

I hope I answered your question. So, I give the word to Antoine for your second question.

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

Well, the second question was related to page 26 as far as I remember, regarding the
savings and pensions net new money in France. Few things to underline there. First, in
terms of percentage of mathematical reserves, the premium income during the period
was slightly lower than last year's, 6.6% rather than 6.8%.
But simultaneously, the surrenders decreased, they represented 4.5% where last year
where we're at 5.5%. The death beneﬁt and other withdrawals are roughly at the same
level. All that results in a net new money, which is now negative by 1.4% in term of
mathematical reserves to 2.4% last year. What is important there is to see that as last year,
we have an important growth in unit-linked and the growth was higher than last year. And
that traditional products are constantly negative, which results in a negative net new
money by €2 billion, where it was negative last year by €3.3 billion.
Let me just add one thing which is that when we compare to the rest of the French market,
we observe that CNP is probably the company which traditional production is still
negative, whereas the other companies on average or at least the market on average has
an increase in traditional products this year. That means what? That means we were the
company which had a policy of maintaining negative production of traditional products.

Page 7 of 16



Company Name: CNP Assurances
Company Ticker: CNP FP Equity
Date: 2018-07-30

FINAL

We continue to consider that these products are not to be promoted today and whereas
the other competitors started to develop sales into additional products. But this is the
main diﬀerence and it must be also said that surrender rate which we have at CNP
decreased more than the surrender rates of other companies. I'm referring to statistics
which were published by the FFA last week, but for this page.
And the third question you have was linked to new slide published on page 38, and
Thomas will give you some clarity on that.

A - Thomas Béhar
Yes. So, you ask how the €720 million might have evolved comparing to that numbers last
year that we have not yet disclosed. First, it comes from the evolution of the new business
value which is up to €415 million coming from €391 million, so there is a diﬀerence about
€24 million. This €24 million comes from operational improvement. We have an
operational improvement in the three diﬀerent areas: France, Latin America and Europe,
of €35 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

You have a decrease, a negative eﬀect of economic change of €6 million, a positive eﬀect
in France, and a negative eﬀect in Brazil due to change there and light restatement of €5
million, explaining the €24 million of the evolution of the new business value.
Going now to the end of the curve, so where the proﬁt might emerge in the future, the
€720 million. So, part of it is explained by the evolution of the new business value. Last
year, the number would have been €674 million. And it comes almost from the saving and
pension activities. It's quite the same curves from last year for the risk and protection
activities and all the evolutions come from the saving and pensions part of the activities
for the group, and the explanation comes mostly from the evolution of the mix from one
year to the other year.

Q - David Barma

{BIO 21843622 <GO>}

Great. Thank you. I just had one follow-up, sorry, on the second point, which was on the
slide 26. I was actually wondering how the slide will look like for protect – for French
protection and if we've seen any big changes in the surrender rates mostly and the other
withdrawals from – compared to last year in protection, in mortgage insurance, but not
only the rest of the portfolio as well.

A - Frédéric Lavenir
I suppose that, in fact, you're referring to new regulation in French protection business
and the impact of this new regulation to our business. Okay. If it's the case, so far, we have
not noticed very, very particular movements from our customers linked to this new
regulation which allows more surrenders than before. But it is too early to pronounce
deﬁnitely on the success of this new regulation. We are very cautious. So far, we have not
noticed very much. We will observe at the end of the year whether the new regulation has
an impact on the production and on the outstanding contracts. But so far, there is no
speciﬁc eﬀect, which (00:41:57).

Well, the provisions which were made will remain under scrutiny. We in fact do not know if
we will maintain, we will need to use these provisions or not.

Q - David Barma

Yeah. Thank you.

Operator
Our next question is from Nick Holmes from Société Générale. Please go ahead.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Hi, there. Thank you very much. I had a couple of questions. The ﬁrst is on the dividend
policy. I wondered if you could give us an update in particular because your cash
generation has been so strong. Does this give you more conﬁdence that you can raise the
dividend?

Bloomberg Transcript

And the second question sort of on the same thing, looking at unit-linked growth, I mean,
this has been really very good. But how sustainable is it? And if there is a market
correction, do you think you can carry on growing unit-linked? Thank you very much.

A - Frédéric Lavenir
I will answer the second question and will leave Antoine answering the ﬁrst one. About
unit-linked, we always said that – well, in French, we say the unit-linked ﬁgures will not go
until the sky. Of course, it is something which is going to slow down, but you have to
know that we are very diﬀerent from the market we were. We had a very, very low unitlinked activity in the past.
So, we are under the market and we are still under the market. So, we have improvement
room for that. Then, our improvement in the structure of our activity in the saving – in
saving activity is based on the development of our patrimonial (00:44:11) activity which
was zero three years ago. So on this side, we have still improvement areas.
So, it is not only the market, but it's also our position in the market which explains the
growth and the change. So, yes, it will not go at this pace for tens of years, but we came
from very low. And what we are starting to do is going to continue our hope.
Then, for the ﬁrst question, perhaps Antoine you could take the word.

FINAL

Okay. Regarding the dividend policy, just a word, Nick, of course, operating cash ﬂow
increase is pleasant for us, but there is absolutely no indexation of our dividend policy on
any aggregate which is – which could be EBIT or net revenue and so and so, and there's
no indexation on the operating free cash ﬂow. It's just a sign that the company is in good
shape and that we can face diﬀerent developments in the future. But the dividend policy
will be decided for our 2018 year by the board at the beginning of 2019, and it is not time
to mention it.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much for that. Just as a very quick follow-up, when you review the
dividend at the board level, could you remind us again what are the main criteria to
assess the dividend?

A - Frédéric Lavenir
No. Frédéric Lavenir speaking. I'm sorry, today, you cannot expect from me a new
dividend policy. So, it's, of course, something which will be discussed every year with our
board and with our shareholders, but I'm really sorry, but today, we'll not change anything
to our traditional disclosure about the dividend policy which is not to be changed or more
commented today. I'm sorry.

Okay. No problem. That's very helpful. Thank you very much.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Rahul Parekh from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.

Q - Rahul A. Parekh

{BIO 18787842 <GO>}

Hi. I have two questions, please. The ﬁrst question is on solvency. You said that – I didn't
get you properly when you said that 4% from the solvency is going to disappear by
December. I didn't actually – the audio wasn't correct, so could you explain that again?
And the second question is what is the excess capital, given your solvency coverage ratio
that you have set aside for deals? Thank you.

A - Frédéric Lavenir
Well, Antoine?

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

Well, regarding the Solvency II, I just mentioned in my presentation the fact that 198% now
incorporates the result of an issue of Tier 1 in June, which represents roughly 4%. And that
by the end of 2018, we will have to reimburse another Tier 1 which, by and large, will also
represent between 3% and 4% of Solvency II ratio. That means that by the end of a year,
technically, you should not see 198% ﬁgure, but rather a ﬁgure lower by 4%, just that.

And about your ﬁrst question, as you noticed, we didn't conclude our discussions with our
(00:48:35) in France. At the time when we when we concluded and I hope it would be as
soon as possible we will disclose the ﬁnancing aspect of that. So, you will have all the
information, all necessary information with necessary comments in due time.

Q - Rahul A. Parekh

{BIO 18787842 <GO>}

Okay. Not an issue. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Rötger Franz from Société Générale. Please go
ahead.

Q - Rötger Franz
Yes. Hello. Thanks for taking my question. Just one question regarding your capital
structure. I mean, in the past you have been rather reluctant to commit to new RT1 issues
and indicated that you prefer to increase Tier 2 capital. Now you've come to the market
with an RT1 and where do we actually see your optimal capital structure going forward
and how do you want to get there? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Frédéric Lavenir
Well, meantime our Restricted Tier 1 format appeared and we considered that it was a
good opportunity to increase our Tier 1 capital, which will allow us next time to have more
choice between increasing Tier 1 or again increasing Tier 2 capital. But we didn't consider
that before the terms of Restricted Tier 1 allowed us to have a relatively non-expensive
source of capital which was the case. I'll remind you that our issue was made at very low
rate, and it was very positive for the shareholders and the balance sheet.

Operator
Okay. We have a next question from Ralph Hebgen from KBW. Please go ahead.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Yeah. Hi, guys. It's Ralph Hebgen from KBW. I've got a few things I'd like to ask, but many
of them are just conﬁrmation of numbers to the extent that you are happy to disclose
them, so it shall be quick. So, the ﬁrst longer one is just looking at the net operating cash
of €809 million, you have analysis on the slide, of course, reveals that this is mostly driven
by higher MCEV proﬁts and then also a lower reduction – sorry, a higher reduction in
required capital for new business. Just a question, how sustainable do you think these two
dynamics are in the future and what drove speciﬁcally the reduction required capital for
new business? So, that's question number one.
The second question relates to your risk and protection business. Just on the combined
ratio there, if you look at the development of combined ratio in the past interims, there is

some volatility there. If you just look at the numbers, it's 85%, then 82%, 81%, then 84%,
back to 81%. What drives this volatility and do you think that volatility will be a factor of
your risk and protection business in the future?
And then, to simple numbers questions. Can you disclose how much the contribution to
EBIT was from your explicit expense savings program, the OpEx program that you
announced a few years ago? And second, how much is now the capital held in Brazil that
is not included in the Solvency II ratio? Thank you very much.

Regarding the ﬁrst question about the sustainability of the structure of operating cash
ﬂow, it is a measurement which relies mainly on MCEV diﬀerent assumptions. And if we
take apart these assumptions, our policy is clearly to have more intensive capital
allocation and to improve the substantial cash ﬂow to capital. Of course, with a diﬀerent
over assumption regarding the environment move negatively, it would not be positive.
But on the core of that, you must have in mind that these ﬁgures realize not only an
improvement of environment, but also a policy of a very, I would say, prudent capital
management in terms of MCEV.
Regarding combined ratio, the volatility of it is clearly partly made of the Brazilian
volatility, the volatility of the real, okay. If you look at the like-for-like ﬁgures, in fact
improvement is very constant. And what we are doing is to try to improve this combined
ratio in the diﬀerent areas of our business in France, of course, without – naturally without
any change eﬀect, in Brazil as well with speciﬁc elements regarding expenses in IT system
in Brazil, which we have to renew. It was one of the conclusions of new CEO of our
Brazilian subsidiary. He has to – overall diﬀerent IT system in each company, and of
course, it will be also the case in diﬀerent other European activities.

A - Frédéric Lavenir
On this last point, and you have to take into account the weight of our Brazilian activity in
the risk and personal – personal risk business. It's very heavy. So, it's naturally sensible to
the currency eﬀects and it explains a part of this volatility you noticed.
And on the ﬁrst point, just to remind what I said in the conclusion of our presentation, the
change in the structure of our balance sheet, of our technical reserves, and the change in
the structure of our revenue is focused on less capital consuming business mix.
On the operational eﬃciency, we announced €60 million objective at the beginning of
our program. So, we will reach this objective and hope a little better than this objective.
And those €60 million are the main explanation of our operational performance. You
have, of course, to take into account the fact that we invest in new business or in
regulatory needs.
And for those reasons, you cannot have a direct link between the realization of our
program and the evolution of our cost/income ratio, but you cannot use it since two years

starting this program. Our cost/ income ratio is going down much quicker than before, so
it's an eﬀect of this plan, of this program, which is going very well.

FINAL

The last point about the excess capital in Brazil, if I understood your question, perhaps
Marie Grison, our Chief Risk Oﬃcer will give the answer.

A - Marie Grison

{BIO 15895562 <GO>}

So, on Solvency II group ratio is around €2 billion corresponding to the excess of Brazilian
capital over the contributed SCR which is not (00:57:23) taken into account.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

That's great. Thank you very much, indeed.

Operator
Thank you. We have no other questions.

A - Frédéric Lavenir
So, we have a few written questions from Thomas Fossard, HSBC. The ﬁrst one relates to
the PPE at 5.5% of the French provisions, how should we expect this ﬁgure to trend going
forward, (00:58:01) have started to stabilize and may be gradually increasing?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Thomas Béhar
Antoine is specialist for that question.

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

Well, what we do is to compare our situation with our diﬀerent competitors in France. And
when you look protection of balance sheet in terms of diﬀerent elements, unrealized
gains in equity, unrealized gains in bonds, PPE and other aspects, we are roughly at the
same level as other companies.
As we are in a period of very low interest rates (00:58:44), we do not consider that it is a
moment to reduce impulse (00:58:52) to protect the balance sheet. And it is clearly not
actual to reduce the speed of increasing the PPE in the half year.

A - Frédéric Lavenir
Two other questions from Thomas. Any update on the current discussion regarding the
renewal of the agreement in Brazil and clariﬁcation regarding the timing for reaching an
agreement? And if not already made, could Frédéric comment on his personal decision to
leave the group?
On the ﬁrst question, I think we already answered. We are continuing the discussion. They
are very positive. And so, it's going very well, longer than expected for many reasons,

mainly governance reasons in Brazil. And we are still in the framework we disclosed in last
September. So it's a little longer than expected, but going the right way as far as I know
today. So, that's exactly what I said and I think there is nothing else to say. I don't have any
other information to give today. And as soon as we have new information, we will, of
course, disclose it.
And on the ﬁrst question, thank you, Thomas, for the question. Well, we disclosed a press
release two weeks ago. And I said I was leaving, decided to leave my position for
personal reasons, so I can only repeat that it is a personal decision, for personal reasons.
And by personal means that it is linked to my personal, I cannot give any other comments
because there is nothing else to say than a personal decision. Sorry. But there is nothing
else. It's very simple.
So we have three questions from Benoît Valleaux, Oddo BHF. First one is what has been
the current investment yield in the ﬁrst half of 2018? And what has been your reinvestment
yield over the semester?
Antoine?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

You ﬁnd it on page 42 of the presentation. On European portfolio, the average
reinvestment rate was 1.1% in the ﬁrst half of 2018. Okay. And you see the split of diﬀerent
bond investments we had over time. And if you look on the page before, 41, you see that
the average return on ﬁxed rate investments in 2018 ﬁrst half year was 2.81% to be
compared with 2.96% last year.

A - Frédéric Lavenir
Another question from Benoît regarding the reinsurance result in the P&L, and what
explains the variation of around €80 million for the ﬁrst half of this year compared to the
ﬁrst half of 2017?
Thomas?

A - Thomas Béhar
Let us go the third question and we have time to review the ﬁrst and second one. Which is
the third question?

A - Frédéric Lavenir
(01:03:08).

A - Thomas Béhar
Okay. Well, Benoît, we'll give you answer on the website which is very precise and
nobody around the table has it in mind.

Okay. Thank you. We have a following question from Ralph Hebgen from KBW. Please go
ahead.

FINAL

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Again, just one follow-up on the combined ratio explanation. You said the volatility, such
as it is, is driven to some extent at least by Brazil, and it would be a forex eﬀect there. I'm
unsure how to interpret this, because it's a ratio and it's a P&L ratio, so I would have
thought that any forex eﬀect will aﬀect the numerator and the denominator equally, and,
therefore, be largely neutral on the combined ratio. So, any explanation on that would be
– yeah, go on.

A - Antoine Lissowski

{BIO 4384399 <GO>}

Ralph, when you have a ratio, there is one ﬁgure which is higher than the other, and even
if two ﬁgures are aﬀected by the same change in terms of currency, the ratio changes
itself.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Okay. And one other question is...

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Thomas Béhar
Do you understand? It's very simple, but you have just to think that when you have two
diﬀerent ratios, if the way to one of them is changing, then the average ratio is changing.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

The average – okay, ﬁne. Fair enough. Okay. And one last one, this perhaps is more openended. There are ongoing negotiations it seems on the shareholder pact in France. Are
there any updates which you can share with us on developments there?

A - Frédéric Lavenir
No, I'm sorry. So, about that point, the only people you can ask a question are our
shareholders. So, if you want something very simple and which is a fact, we disclosed a
press release on Friday evening with a few words from Eric Lombard, so you can read it.
And if you need comments or explanations, I think he is the best person to be asked. But I
do not comment either press rumors or the expression of other people who are, of
course, able to comment their own words. So, I'm sorry, but I do not have any information
and I cannot comment those rumors or the words of Eric Lombard. I'm sorry.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Okay. That's great. Both things are perfectly clear. Thank you very much.

a short answer to this question. But we are happy to answer any other question, if there is
someone on the line or by the Q&A on the chat.
