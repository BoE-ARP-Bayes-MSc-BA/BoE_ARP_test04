{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Good morning, and thank you for the introduction Brett. Welcome to everyone on the call.
I'd like to begin with a few words on the current global health and economic situation.
COVID-19 pandemic has affected all of us, either directly or indirectly. I'd like to express
my appreciation to my Argo colleagues across the globe, who have worked diligently
throughout this period largely on a remote basis. It has not been easy, but you have
continued to serve our customers and producers with the consistent and engaged service
level that they expect. I'm optimistic that we will emerge from this period as an even
more resilient and dynamic organization.
Pandemic has impacted our business, but I believe that Argo is in a solid position to
handle the effects of both the asset and liability side of our balance sheet. We're
obviously watching the developments closely and we'll adapt our businesses accordingly.
The situation has revealed that we are flexible organization, and our focus on risk
management has prepared us for external shocks. I'll have more to say about this later,
but first let me discuss some operating highlights from the first quarter and our views on
the current environment.

Bloomberg Transcript

From a revenue perspective, our business was not impacted by the pandemic during the
first quarter. I'll touch on a claims impact of COVID-19 in a moment. Gross premium was
up almost 9% for the group with a 16% growth in the U.S. and roughly flat in international.
Looking into the U.S. results first, we achieved accelerating growth in the period with
strong new and renewal business production. Pricing continues to be a tailwind and was
up again in mid single-digits on average during the first quarter. Property and professional
lines were standouts with rate increases in the mid-teens, but the momentum is broadbased across almost all areas of the U.S. business. Additionally, certain areas are seeing
tightening of terms and conditions or higher insured retentions, all of which should benefit
our underwriting results going forward.
Submission growth in the U.S. was strong during the quarter at around 20%, roughly the
same level of growth we saw during the fourth quarter of 2019. As the effects of the
pandemic started to take hold in April, we have seen a drop-off in submission flow, but it's
still positive year-over-year.
However, our renewal business has remained strong as well, and we have seen a mix of
results so far with some businesses able to maintain growth momentum. Overall, gross
premium in the U.S. was up modestly year-over-year for the month of April, assigned that
our customers continue to value our Argo as a meaningful partner in their business. The
impact over the coming months will be based on economic activity, so we will watch
closely and react accordingly. In total, I'm pleased with our U.S. results in the quarter. I'm
excited about the market opportunities in the U.S. and the team we have in place to move
us forward.
Turning to international. We continue to focus on improving profitability of the book and
selectively focus our resources on areas where we believe there are long-term

Page 2 of 14

FINAL

opportunities to generate an attractive underwriting margin. As I spoke about last quarter,
this is a uniform strategy across Argo. Underwriting profit is our priority. Gross written
premium in international was roughly flat in the first quarter, with growth in liability and
specialty offsetting the decline in property.
Top line results were impacted by our decision last year to exit certain classes in our
Lloyd's insurance business. The first quarter showed a continuation of pricing momentum
near double-digits with areas of property, liability and marine experiencing rate increases
around 10%, and in some cases much higher than that. So far in the month of April, we
have seen some negative pressure on premium growth, but a continuation of positive
pricing trends.
In addition to rates, we have also adjusted our risk tolerance in some classes including
reduced line[ph] sizes. For example, in our Bermuda casualty book, which is less than $100
million of gross premium, we have reduced our max[ph] gross lines size from $50 million
to $25 million, while maintaining our net retention at below 25%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Given the positive rate increases our Bermuda casualty team is achieving, this action is
only expected to impact the top line by roughly $10 million for the year. It's just one
example, but we expect actions like this along with better rates will lead to less volatility
and stronger margins going forward.
Our International business could have almost $20 million catastrophes losses in the
quarter, which was primarily related to the pandemic. Excluding COVID-19 charges there
were minimal catastrophes and loss results were quite good and in line with our
expectation in the quarter. Reserve development for both our U.S. and International
segments was modest in the quarter. We're always going to have a mix of positive and
negative movements in our reserves, but I'm encouraged by this overall result.
Additionally, we employed an internationally recognized third-party actuarial firm to
perform an in-depth review of our reserves across the company as of year end 2019. I'm
happy to share that their central estimate was in line with our carried reserve total at
December 31, 2019. This is not an indication of any future performance, but it does give
me more confidence following the actions we took last year.
Our group underwriting results produced a combined ratio of 103.2% for the quarter. That
is not a number we're satisfied with, but it was significantly impacted by COVID-19.
Splitting the charges related to the pandemic, our combined ratio was squarely within our
prior stated objective of 96% to 98% for the full year and our adjusted operating ROE
would have been 8%.
The pandemic has and will continue to impact industry results as well as ours. Some of our
businesses like construction and surety have already started to feel the effects of a dropoff in demand. The severity and duration of any economic slowdown will influence the
immediate and long-term impact on the industry's premium growth. We believe Argo as a
specialty commercial insurance underwriter is well prepared to operate in this uncertain
environment with a diversified product base, strong operational capabilities and talented

FINAL

staff. We have the teams, nimbleness, systems and tools to respond to market
opportunities. Additionally, fortunate to be operating in a strong pricing environment that
is not slowing. It's too early to share a full understanding of how our business and
performance will ultimately be impacted by the pandemic, but most immediate negative
effects will be on our investment income and written premiums.
So let's clear how the current situation will impact overall loss results across our book of
business. Regardless, we remain focused on controlling the things we can control and that
primarily means improving our combined ratio. Overall, we made some positive strides as
an organization during the quarter and remain focused on our long-term strategy and
delivering value for stakeholders. We continue to focus on applying a theme of simplify,
reduce and eliminate across our operations, while selectively investing for the future and
improving operations.
I'll now turn the call over to Jay for some additional detail on the financials.

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks, Kevin. As most of you already know, last week we preannounced certain items
related to our first quarter earnings. As a result, I'll focus my comments today on providing
more detail on the losses specific to the COVID-19 pandemic and a few other key items
impacting our financial results for the quarter.
Despite the impact of the unusual losses in the quarter, Argo produced an operating
profit of $12.6 million or $0.36 per diluted share, not a bad result given the circumstances.
In the first quarter, as Kevin mentioned, U.S. gross premiums were up 16%, our growth
was driven by a continuation of positive rate trends in strategic growth initiatives.
The strongest growth was in our professional liability and construction business units. Net
written and earned premium growth during the quarter in the U.S. came in at 8.5% and
10.5%, respectively. For 2020, we expect net to gross written premium ratios in the U.S. to
be in the low 60% range.
On the international side, our gross premiums year-over-year were approximately flat in
the first quarter of 2020. As Kevin mentioned, rates were up across all lines in
international and we saw pockets of growth, but maximizing underwriting profitability
remains our focus. In some business units such as our Bermuda Insurance operation,
positive pricing trends accelerated in the first quarter. We will continue to push for rate
increases where the market will allow.
As we disclosed last week, the first quarter included expected losses stemming from the
COVID-19 pandemic, which impacted our overall underlying profitability. For the quarter,
the combined ratio was 103.2%, compared to 94.7% for the 2019 first quarter. The yearover-year increase in the combined ratio was primarily due to a higher loss ratio that was
driven by catastrophe losses of $29 million, including approximately $26 million related to
the pandemic.

FINAL

I would highlight that reserve development in the quarter was essentially flat, much as it
was in the prior year. It's a welcome change from the last few quarters of 2019. We do our
own assessment of reserves at the end of every quarter. These estimates are also
reviewed by our auditor, who has an independent view. Additionally, as Kevin mentioned,
there was a group wide review completed by an independent third-party, not our auditor,
as of yearend, that third-party work output was consistent with are carried reserves.
The charges in the quarter related to COVID-19 reflect our estimated losses through
March 31. Clearly this event is ongoing, and it will take time to determine the ultimate
losses associated with the pandemic. We do expect some additional losses in subsequent
quarters, so we have addressed known and expected exposures where coverage is
explicit. The magnitude of additional losses will primarily depend on how long periods of
lockdown last and if future events are postponed or canceled.

Bloomberg Transcript

Of the charges we recorded for the pandemic, most of the dollars, specifically $18.7
million related to the pandemic were in our International segment. These losses were
roughly split between our contingency book written out of Lloyd's that provides event
cancellation coverage and property exposures where we have some affirmative business
interruption cover for communicable diseases.
In the U.S., the charge in the quarter reflects our expectation for additional claims related
expenses and limited areas where affirmative coverage exist. Our direct pandemic
exposure is primarily in our property and contract binding units. In the U.S., fewer than half
of our property policies provide any business interruption coverage at all and the vast
majority of these have specific virus exclusions. Where we do have affirmative business
interruption coverage for communicable diseases, there are specific limits that are
separate and distinct from the limits provided by the physical properties themselves,
which also limits our potential exposure. In total, the vast majority of our business does
not have affirmative coverage for communicable diseases.
However, where we do have affirmative cover we have assessed each policy individually
and put up a specific provision commensurate with expected loss. It will be indirect
impacts of the pandemic as well, for example, reduced expenses. Claims activity tends to
correlate with risk exposures and we believe risk exposures should generally be lower
under our current living and working conditions. We will have more to say on this in coming
quarters.
Our loss ratio of 64.6% was up 8 points from the prior year largely due to the higher
catastrophe and pandemic losses that I already mentioned. The current accident year exCAT loss ratio increased by 1.4 point year-over-year. This was due to an increase in our
U.S. segment as some of the current and prior year actions during 2019 impacted our
current view of losses. Additionally, we had a single large loss in the U.S. that increased
the current accident year ex-CAT loss ratio by 30 basis points.
I would note that while the current accident year ex-CAT loss ratio in the U.S. was up from
the first quarter of 2019 to the first quarter of 2020. The 58.4% we reported in the
quarter was better than the 59% we reported for the full year of 2019. We believe this is

Page 5 of 14



Company N ame: Argo Group I nternational H oldings L td
Company Ticker: ARGO US Equity
Date: 2020-05-08

FINAL

the best way to think about the underlying margin dynamic in our U.S. book -- in our book,
particularly in the U.S.
Our reported expense ratio in the quarter was 38.6%, which was up 50 basis points from
the prior year. In the U.S., the expense ratio for the 2020 first quarter was 31.8%, an
improvement of 2.6 points compared to the 2019 first quarter. The improvement in the
expense ratio was driven by earned premium growing in excess of our expense base as
well as additional seating commission, and some shifts in business mix.
The international expense ratio for the 2020 first quarter was up substantially at 45.6%.
This increase from the prior year level was due to a couple of factors. First, we are
supporting slightly more of the capital in our Lloyd's business in 2020 and with this we
assume a higher share of the expense base. In other words, expenses allocated
according to the level of capital provided and as we provided more capital, we retained
more expense. These expenses are recognized from the beginning, but it will take a few
quarters for the higher earned premium base to catch up.

Bloomberg Transcript

Second, we have some non-recurring expenses related to a reduction in personnel on the
quarter. And finally, we chose not to renew a major inwards reinsurance contract that was
written on a net basis. We are aggressively focused on getting to a more sustainable
expense ratio in the international segment. But we expect it will remain above 40% in
2020 as we continue to work to simplify our platform.
Turning to investments. Our net investment income was $35.5 million in the quarter, up
nearly 5% from the prior year quarter. Financial markets experienced significant volatility
driven by global response to the spread of the pandemic, S&P was down 20% in the
quarter and credit spreads were significantly wider in both investment grade and noninvestment grade fixed income markets, we all know this. As a result, our portfolio was
down 2.5% overall in the first quarter.
Fortunately, we ended the quarter -- we entered the quarter with cash balances high after
reducing risk assets in the fourth quarter as stated on our last call. Our derisking efforts
helped cushion the markets impact on the portfolio in March. Alternatives were reported
up $2.5 million in the quarter and included our investment -- and included in our
investment income total. I would note that our private equity fund performance is
reported on a quarterly lag and our hedge funds are reported on a monthly lag.
We have provided additional disclosure in the tables in the first quarter press release on
balances in each of these allocations. Based on market performance, we expect some
negative marks on these holdings when we report second quarter results. This has the
potential to have a measurable negative impact on our reported investment income in
that period.
We've had a solid recovery in the portfolio during April and the start of May. Additionally,
we will record a gain in the second quarter related to the closing of our previously
announced sale of Trident. The combination of investment portfolio, recovery and the

Page 6 of 14

sale of Trident has already helped us to recover approximately half of the decline in book
value we experienced during the quarter.
Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks, and we're now ready to take questions.

FINAL

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Question And Answer)
We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) The first
question comes from Greg Peters of Raymond James.

Q - Greg Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

Good morning, Tom. Can we first focus on your disclosures around COVID? I was listening
to your comments and I think you said in the U.S. business the vast majority of business
interruption had a pandemic exclusion, but I don't want to put words in your mouth. And I
assume that's the case for the -- same case for international, but can you confirm that?
And then can you talk about how event cancellation surety, business interruption losses
might evolve for you guys over the course of the next several months?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Yes, good morning Greg, it's Kevin. Well, I'll start with the first part of your question. Yeah,
we did say that while there is some specific grant[ph] business interruption covers the
vast majority of that coverage, it does have virus exclusions on it.
In International a lot of the property coverage we have is on the shared and layered
programs, so the eye cover on that tends not to have those exclusions, but we don't have
as much of it, and in each instance we specifically looked at what the exposures were
made, appropriate adjustments based on what those exposures specifically were.
Relative to like a small SME type business, we've got very little of that and there is some
coverage for it. But it's such a small exposure, it falls into the category of there is some
coverage and in some places it is excluded, but it's like I said very, very small exposure.
Shifting gears over to the surety question you had. Can you repeat that part of it with
surety?

Q - Greg Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

Yes, Kevin. I'm just -- as we think about how, -- we realize there's a lot of unknown
variables going on, just curious, how you think, the second, third, fourth quarters might be
affected by business interruption claims, event cancellation claims, surety claims?

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Page 7 of 14



Company N ame: Argo Group I nternational H oldings L td

Date: 2020-05-08

All right, yeah.

Q - Greg Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

FINAL

And I'm not asking you to identify what the cat loss numbers are. I'm just trying to get a
sense of the cadence of how these things will evolve within the company over the next
several quarter?

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Yeah, thanks for the clarification. So with respect to event cancellation, by the end of
March we had a really good idea, there was a lot of things that were had been announced
that they were either postponed or canceled with many being canceled.
So in our event cancellation book, which is underwritten out of the syndicate. In the
international operations, the exposures were known and as those play out in terms of
how they ultimately settle out, there will be some mix of results. Given that there were
only two weeks in the quarter for surety there weren't any losses that came in early on,
but the ongoing effects of the economy will obviously make that business different than it
was in previous quarters, right, but trying to evaluate that is difficult at this point.

Bloomberg Transcript

From a property standpoint, I think we've seen most of the claims come through or we
knew there were specific coverage, and there will obviously be more things coming
forward, but we expect the magnitude of that to be lower than it was in this quarter.

Q - Greg Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks.

A - Jay S. Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

Kevin, if I could add just on the surety side. We've talked before about Surety, and the fact
that we underwrite some energy business there, that's less than 17% of the overall Surety
portfolio and it's regularly stress tested, and as you've seen, oil is back in the mid 20
range.
So we've been through periods like that before, and it's like I said, less than less than 17%
of the portfolio. The other thing that I would note is that, in the Surety business most of
our surety is commercial surety, and a lot of the businesses that are associated with that
would be essential businesses. So not saying that it won't be impacted but those are
factors that we think about when we think about the surety business.

Q - Greg Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

Excellent clarification. And if you can, just a follow up. You mentioned that you're seeing -just on new business you're seeing some pressure in construction surety. When I think
about the reporting segments, the reporting lines that you guys have in your income
statement, be it in the U.S. or in international, which areas do you think will see the most

Page 8 of 14



Company N ame: Argo Group I nternational H oldings L td
Company Ticker: ARGO US Equity
Date: 2020-05-08

downward premium pressure from this catastrophic level of unemployment and what's
happened to the economies here and elsewhere?

FINAL

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Yeah, it's Kevin again. That's a good question, Greg. On the U.S. side, and this applies to
the company broadly, part of the reason that being a specialty company is helpful in times
like this and other times is that you have a real broad spread of risk, and by industry
classes and geographies.
So some of the areas where you'd expect unemployment to have an impact with say
payroll related businesses, work comp being an example, the type of work comp we write
is associated with essential businesses. So while we're going to see some impact, it's not
going to be the same. It's also a relatively small portion of what we do as a group, I'm just
using it as an example.

Bloomberg Transcript

As I mentioned, in April we were up 5.6% in GWP in the U.S. The drivers of growth will not
necessarily be what they were in previous years, right? Then that happens all the time -with 15 discreet businesses in that segment, there's a shift from time-to-time. So we're
seeing opportunities where the market is contracting and we're also seeing premium
growth through not only this increase in year-over-year submissions, but through
something (inaudible)
Internationally, it's a different story, right? Because a lot of that is driven by some larger
accounts and things that are coming through the various countries, and some of those
were affected (Technical Difficulty) in Europe before the U.S. business was affected.
So that business has been affected more from the top line standpoint in terms of either,
where we were last year or what we may have expected, but the rates are still strong, I
think opportunities are there. So I'd look at the impact initially to be more on the
international side than directly in the U.S. side. But again, I'm not going to try to figure out
how that may play out. It's too (inaudible) as of now.

Q - Greg Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

Got it. Thanks for the color. One other important question I guess to ask at this juncture,
considering the unprecedented times we're in, would be, -- some comments around the
company's capital position, the liquidity of the company, how you sit with the rating
agency ratios et cetera?

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Jay, you want to provide some color here?

A - Jay S. Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

Yes. Sure. So on the liquidity standpoint, I think as we mentioned, we had as I did mention
in my remarks, we had moved to reducing risk assets at the end of the year that was
designed to put the capital back in the -- into some of our underwriting businesses.
Page 9 of 14

FINAL

We continue that in the first quarter and you'll see that our cash in short-term liquidity is
quite high, it was high at the end of the year and that remains high through the first
quarter. From a capital standpoint, that first quarter, it reminds me a little bit the -unfortunately, maybe it was March of 2009 when financials were published perhaps at the
bottom of the cycle and March 31 was pretty close to the bottom of the cycle. And as I
said, we've recovered quite a bit of capital from that point as have most companies, I
would presume.
And so I think everybody lost capital from the market conditions. We feel like our capital
position remains strong. And then the question becomes the permanence, if you will, of
the dislocation, how long does it last and what does the recovery look like. So we have
lots of alternatives as well if we needed to strengthen our capital base. But at this
moment, we feel like our capital position is strong.

Q - Greg Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

Got it. Thank you for the answers.

Operator
The next question comes from Matt Carletti with JMP. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Matt Carletti

{BIO 5249827 <GO>}

Hey guys, good morning. Just wanted to follow on, actually Greg's question there kind of
the next step on capital and kind of ask it a little different way, but kind of capital priorities
here and kind of trying to balance everything going on in the environment. So there could
be some reduced exposures, pricing's good. a lot of change. Again, a stock that's trading
at $0.60 on the dollar and that's pretty easy math in terms of book value accretion. So
maybe just help us with maybe to -- help us gauge to what extent there may or may not
be excess capital in the business? And then to the extent there is, how you view or assess
kind of underwriting opportunities versus buying back stock at the extreme valuations.

A - Jay S. Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

Kevin, why don't I take the first part of it and then why don't you touch on the underwriting
opportunities.

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Jay S. Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

All right, yeah. I appreciate the question. Just given the -- I would say given the economic
and political environment that we're in right now, the repatriation of capital through share
buyback is probably not a high priority for any company right now. And that said, we came
into this year very excited about the underwriting opportunity. And so maybe, I'll let Kevin
handle that. But I think that remains our top priority.

FINAL

Yeah, thanks Jay for that. That is a true statement. And remember that the vast majority
of what we have certainly in the U.S. business where the best opportunities are is in the
casualty business, right, from both policy count and premium standpoint.
So those opportunities exist, there are people that are retreating for a variety of reasons,
some are capital related, some are results related, but our ability to attract new folks to
the organization to leverage the systems and relationships we already have, and continue
to expand areas where we're making good headway and profit in the U.S. market is
certainly there whether we do it from the platforms in the US to the Bermuda or out of
the Syndicate.

(Operator Instructions). The next question comes from Jeff Schmidt of William Blair. Please
go ahead.

Q - Jeff Schmidt

{BIO 15098244 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. What type of exposure do you see, I guess just in the workers comp
book, the D&L book? Is much of the workers comp provided to first responders
healthcare workers or anything like that? And D&L, are you seeing in the uptick in claims
there I guess just with the market movement?

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Yes. So thanks Jeff for the question. As I mentioned, we're in some essential businesses,
while we write a reasonable size of public entity business, we actually have a very small
work comp book within that business, especially on a primary basis. So there hasn't been
much activity.
We also don't expect a lot, just giving what our position is there. The largest area we have
is through Rockwood on the work comp side, the second largest would be in Argo
Insurance, which is really a focus on more grocery stores and restaurants relative to the
comp exposure. So while there is some in those areas, it is not significant and it's a
relatively small portion. The total comp writings of the company that where we are actually
retaining risk is less than $125 million.

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Yes. At this point, no. Well, there's a lot of talk about it, but at this point we haven't seen a
significant increase in D&L relative to this situation.

Q - Jeff Schmidt

{BIO 15098244 <GO>}

Okay. And then just looking at growth in the U.S, obviously still strong. I think you said
submission activity went from 20% down to remained positive, I don't know if you meant
low single digits.

Yes. I was talking year-over-year. Sorry to interrupt, but I was talking year-over-year. So it
was 20% growth in the fourth quarter submissions year-over-year. It was 20% in the first
quarter. In April, it was positive -- it was less than 5%, but it was positive.

Q - Jeff Schmidt

{BIO 15098244 <GO>}

Got you. And I was just--.

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Premium was up 5.6%.

Q - Jeff Schmidt

{BIO 15098244 <GO>}

Okay. I was curious if that had -- if you're starting to see that recover? And then maybe if
you could just talk a little more broadly about the growth dynamics in the E&S market?
What type of rate are you seeing there? Are you seeing standard insurers just given the
risks out there moving away from some business that may be borderline pushing it to the
E&S market? What are the dynamics you're seeing out there in E&S?

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

Yes, so the first part of your question about what are we seeing after April. It's way too
early to tell for May. But what I will say is that, the tools we have put in place over the past
years have allowed us to become a lot more efficient at attracting submissions that are
more likely to translate into written premium.

So it's not just about submission flow, it's about the quality of submissions. And as we
continue to refine the appetites and work with our producers on that, the percentage
growth may not be a complete indicator of what the written premium growth maybe. And
then the second piece is -- I'm sorry, repeat the second part you wanted.

Q - Jeff Schmidt

{BIO 15098244 <GO>}

Well, just the dynamics of the E&S market?

A - Kevin J. Rehnberg

{BIO 3832713 <GO>}

All, right. So what's happening there is there are areas where we may be committed to a
customer base where there's contraction in an area. I'm thinking of construction at the
moment, where even though there may be not be a lot of construction going on in a
particular region, there are needs that a business has that are ongoing, and they're not
necessarily being met and our ability to create products in an E&S environment is allowing
for growth in an area that is somewhat hampered economically at the moment.
But what we're viewing that as is the opportunity to go get product in the hand of the
customers who expand our customer base during this time, and eventually they're going
to need the covers ahead. And we're hoping that with the relationship we're solving
problems now that will lead to future growth. Aside from that, we are seeing the
increases in the E&S area more or so than in some of those standard area.
