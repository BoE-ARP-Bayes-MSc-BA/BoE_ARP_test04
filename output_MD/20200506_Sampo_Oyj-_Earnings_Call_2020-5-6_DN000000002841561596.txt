Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Thank you, Jarmo, and good afternoon, everyone. We've had an unusual quarter as has
the rest of the world and we all now have to live with many [ph] uncertainties. We will try
to straighten out as many question marks as possible for Sampo in this call and give you
as much facts and information as we can about the development of our Group.
First and foremost, in terms of the technical insurance result, this is the best ﬁrst quarter
ever for our insurance operations in If P&C, the biggest part of the Group. The fact that we
are a very technologically advanced Group with excellent remote capabilities has helped
us also in a socially distant situation, we're able to meet our customers' expectations, sales
have been good until the last two weeks of March and customer satisfaction continued to
be high.
Morten will in a minute give some more in-depth information about If P&C's development
and the COVID-19 eﬀects. But let me already here state that the eﬀects on the insurance
side are very marginal so far.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to our bank asset, it was gratifying to see Nordea deliver a second quarter with
good progress. Obviously, we ﬁrst looked at the loan loss documentation in these
circumstances and there will remain some uncertainties there for all banks. But Nordea
also reminded us all I think that it's a much less risky bank today than 10 years or even ﬁve
years ago, much more a Nordic retail bank than then.
Looking at Nordea's report the other week, I was also satisﬁed to see a bank with a
renewed self-conﬁdence both in the language, in its culture and in the markets. NII and
NCI [ph] developed well, costs and manning are coming down according to plan and
capital is very strong indeed. And market shares are no longer way below Nordea's
distribution capacity, but naturally reﬂecting [ph] where the Company should be. Frank
Vang-Jensen and his team are working quite intensively and I'm pleased to see this.
Returning to Sampo itself in this introduction, we report a solid solvency ratio despite
rather depressed asset values. In times like these, this is both prudent and a good
strategy for potential opportunities, as is well known both Nordea and Topdanmark have
delayed parts or all of their dividends and are reﬂecting -- and reﬂecting this and the
investment markets uncertainties, the Board has decided to propose a EUR1.50 dividend
to the AGM.
Can I have the next slide, please. So, with that and with this beautiful non-life insurance
graph, I hand over to Morten Thorsrud to give us a more in-depth understanding of the
non-life operations that constitute the largest part of this Group. Please, Morten.

FINAL

Thank you, Torbjorn, and good afternoon to all of you. And the ﬁrst quarter of 2020 was
clearly quite an eventful quarter, where the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, of course, is
impacting our business in several areas. Throughout this period, the health of our
employees has of course been a key priority, and hence, we have moved more than
6,000 out of our 7,000 employees to home oﬃces.
I think the organization has responded to this challenge in a really impressive manner as
we have been able to run our business close to normal and actually with very high service
levels throughout this period. In many areas, we have even seen record high customer
satisfaction levels in the midst of this crisis.
During the ﬁrst quarter, some 26,000 COVID-19 related claims were reported with an
estimated claims cost of some EUR12 million. Until end of April, this has increased to some
48,000 claims, most of these being travel claims and most of the claims coming from our
Norwegian business. If has a reinsurance cover with self-retention of SEK100 million or
approximately EUR10 million that cover these travel claims.

Bloomberg Transcript

In today's environment as Torbjorn also mentioned, we do see that we beneﬁt from our
strong digital capabilities as we do absorb high level of online insurance sales, online
insurance service cases, and of course online claims cases. The strength in our digital and
remote business model is expected to be a clear advantage for us going forward in a
world that you can say got a gentle push towards increased use of digital and remote
operations.
On the ﬁnancial side, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic obviously had an impact -signiﬁcant negative impact on the investment return. However, the ﬁnancial impact on the
insurance operation has been limited in the ﬁrst quarter. We continue to deliver strong
earnings generation and we are well-positioned for future challenges and opportunities
with a very strong balance sheet.
The increase in travel claims related to COVID-19 is temporarily oﬀset by somewhat lower
claims frequency in areas such as motor. And going forward, we do of course expect a
negative top line eﬀect as a consequence of the dampened business activity level in the
Nordic and Baltic region.
Turning to the next Page 10. If continues to deliver on its promise of producing consistent
strong underwriting performance. Combined ratio in the ﬁrst quarter was a record low
83.7% down from 86.5% in the ﬁrst quarter of 2019. The underline -- underwriting result
was supported by clear improvement in frequency claims outcome. The cost ratio was on
a low level in the quarter. And we had somewhat more run-oﬀ gain in this quarter than we
had in Q1 2019.
At the same time, we did experience a large claims outcome that was well above what we
expect to be a normal level. The large claims outcome stems in particular from two
Norwegian industrial clients. But the fsingle largest claim was the ﬁre in the parking
garage at Sola, airport in Stavanger in January, where If insured the building, of course, in
addition to our fair share of the cars. If has consistent -- If have had a consistent

underwriting discipline, and they have been also supported by our Nordic and Baltic
scale and diversiﬁcation between the business areas. And this has enabled us over the
last ﬁfteen years to manifest a position as a best in risk insurer in our region with a
combination of low combined ratio and low underwriting volatility.

FINAL

The Nordic P&C insurance market remains rationale with generally sound combined ratio
levels and low volatility compared to other parts of the world.
Turning to the next page, Taking a look at growth development in the ﬁrst quarter. We
have for a period seen a good business momentum and fairly strong top line
development. In Q1, this continues and we produced a purely organic premium growth of
7%. The growth stemmed from both increased business volume through increased
number of customers and insurance products as well as from price increases in the
portfolio. In the ﬁrst quarter of 2020, the split between these two sources of growth would
be roughly 40-60 i.e somewhat more price-driven.
We do see attractive growth in all business areas and all countries. Moving forward, we
do, again, expect some negative top line eﬀect from the COVID-19 situation. But the
strong growth materializing in Q1 makes us well prepared to handle some headwind in
the future as well.
So with that, time concluded on the If presentation and leave the word back to Jarmo.

Thank you, Torbjorn, and thank you, Morten. Operator, we are now ready for the
questions, please.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instruction). Our ﬁrst question comes from the line of Jakob Brink from Nordea.
Please go ahead.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Thank you, and good afternoon. I have a few questions, please. The ﬁrst one is on the
dividend of EUR1.50 and how this plays in with your dividend policy. I know it's within the
plus 70%, but still, how should we look at this going forward? For example, I'm thinking,
this is of course very exceptional times but loan losses in Nordea, I guess, could be
higher, they could be low, who knows.
At the same time, Topdanmark has postponed half of its dividend. We don't know if
Nordea will pay in Q4 or not and so forth. Could this maybe be the opportunity for Sampo
to basically stick to around EUR1.50 in sort of an ordinary dividend and then put the rest of
it into a buyback both this year and also going forward?

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

I'm somewhat surprised at the question. We have been very clear that we have a new
dividend policy, we pay the dividend once a year and the dividend will reﬂect earnings
and be at least 70% of earnings. And that answer has not changed for some time now.

FINAL

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

So how -- so basically, what you're saying is that, let's say Nordea would pay a dividend in
Q4 this year, we should not expect it to be paid out until in connection with the dividend
decision for 2020 to be paid out next year.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Then I expect our Board to take that into consideration when they look at the dividend
proposal for the AGM in 2021.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

And then, sorry just to ﬁnalize on that question. But then next year, it's still 70%. But would
you think that the 2.2% would be the sort of still the -- sort of the underlying base or
would 1.1% reﬂect the new starting point going forward. Just to help us what level we
should expect?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Maybe I was being a little bit ﬂippant [ph] at your question. Firstly, I didn't mean that but
we have a new dividend policy and there is no expectation that there will be an increasing
dividend or something like that.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. And then on to -- again actually one more capital question. In If for the
ﬁrst time for quite some time there is a capital deﬁcit versus the ratings approach of
EUR241 million and no rating agencies doesn't downgrade or upgrade just because it's
EUR200 million. But how do you look at this deﬁcit? Is this something that should be
solved right away, or could it have a potential impact on the upstream from If in
December this year?

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

Good afternoon, Jacob. It's Knut Arne here. There is no plan to sort of downstream capital
to If to ﬁx that deﬁcit, it is a deﬁcit in the S&P model due to the current circumstances after
Q1. If it's there still well capitalized from the perspective of solvency capital. The capital is
only one of many factors that S&P is taking into consideration when setting the rating, but
of course, I'm sure, also they will look to the capital position of all the If and the Group
after Q1 when making the rating decisions going forward. But we consider If still to be
well-capitalized and dividend upstreaming from If as from Sampo will be based on their
earnings and capital position of If as of year-end.

Okay. Thank you. And then my ﬁnal question on non-life insurance, you mentioned it
brieﬂy, Morten. But basically growth has been quite nice in -- across If and especially
Finland is now growing 5%. I don't know if there is any technicalities, but it's the ﬁrst time
it's been growing that much for quite some time. Could you put a few words on that
please?

A - Morten Thorsrud

{BIO 16111627 <GO>}

Yes, Jakob. I think Finland is growing at 3.1% with [ph] constant exchange rates, but still it
is somewhat of an improvement. Earlier, as we've seen quite a negative development on
workers' comp, that situation is still not -- where we would like it to be, but it has improved
somewhat over the period.
Apart from that, we see good growth again also in Finland in all business areas, both in
private, in commercial and industrial. And then again this regarding workers' comp which
has been a bit of the struggle in Finland.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

And the next question comes from the line of Youdish Chicooree from Autonomous.
Please go ahead.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Good afternoon, everyone. I have got two questions, please. The ﬁrst one is just on the
underwriting performance. The year-on-year improvement in your line alteration is quite
strong, was around 3.5 [ph] to 4 points in the ﬁrst quarter. I was wondering if you could
just give us an idea of what the beneﬁt was from benign weather? And to what extent did
the loss ratio beneﬁt from lower frequency during the lockdown? That's my ﬁrst question.
And the second one is just on business interruption fee. And I think you mentioned in
your call and through your standard writings the claims related to COVID-19 would be
excluded, but do you have an estimate of like the potential exposure arising from those
contracts have been absolutely attended downstream.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Yes. I'll try to answer your questions. First, when it comes to the underlying improvement
on the combined ratio, yes, we do see quite healthy development on that. It is hard to
compare sort of and try to make kind of a true underlying development sort of trying to
factor in all the eﬀects, diﬀerent weathers in diﬀerent quarters and so forth. And I think
generally this quarter has been pretty benign when it comes to weather, but that was also
actually the case in the ﬁrst quarter in 2019.

Page 6 of 23



FINAL

Company Name: Sampo Oyj
Company Ticker: SAMPO FH Equity
Date: 2020-05-06

So I would say that sort of most of the improvement that you see in the underlying
combined ratio is a result of the price and proﬁtability actions that we have implemented
over the last few years. And when it -- when it comes to impact of the lockdown, we do
temporarily see somewhat less frequency on motor in particular. It's again hard to exactly
estimate how large proportion of the reduced frequencies from the lockdown, how much
is from again a general benign weather and so forth. But I think what we've said is that it's
probably oﬀsetting quite some of the EUR12 million that we have reported in travel claims.
I think you have a bit of the magnitude there.
When it comes to business interruption, if I got your question correctly. I think as you
know, all know businesses interruption, If typically covering the proﬁt, followed by a
reimbursable property claim. So physical damage of some sort to some imperils, the ﬁre,
the water leakage storm and et cetera.

Bloomberg Transcript

In addition to that, you could have business interruption loss coming from access to the
property being prevented, it's the so-called denial of access. But this is typically when you
have again a property claim, a property damage that makes police or emergency services
hindering your access to your own property.
In terms of epidemic business interruption covers, there are some covers in Sweden and
Finland, but that covers loss from the authorities orders then a disease per speciﬁc laws,
for instance, listeria has been found at the insured location. So again, this is not relevant in
this current Corona situation. You could have of course some additional exposures, but
our assessment so far, having gone through our portfolio and the exposure we have is
that it's very, very limited exposure that we have, when you then disregard the travel
insurance claims that we already talked about.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Okay. So thank you very much. Just one quick follow-up on business interruption. Are
there --were there many other cases where policyholders are disputing the terms and
conditions essentially saying that well losses arising due to the COVID-19 lockdown
should be covered?

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

No.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Okay. All right, thank you.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

I think there is a broad agreement in the Nordic region on the terms and conditions and
how they are to be interpreted.

And the next question comes from the line of Alexander Evans from Credit Suisse. Please
go ahead.

Q - Alexander Evans

{BIO 19956412 <GO>}

And I just got one left actually and Morten, it's on industrial. And I think you touched on it
slightly in your presentation. But if I remember rightly, I think your premium is growing
quite a lot last year in industrial. And I think you said that this is volume inﬂated as
competitors exited the market due to some proﬁtability there. And are you seeing If -- on
combined ratio in the quarter as a one-oﬀ.

A - Morten Thorsrud

{BIO 16111627 <GO>}

Yes. I hope I got your question fully, there was a bit of disturbance on the line. And we
have seen an attractive combined ratio for our industrial business. If you look back, sort of
the last say ﬁve years or even more than that. And now, we did have two individual large
claims in this business area in the ﬁrst quarter and we clearly expect this to be sort of the
normal volatility that you would expect to have in this business area and the two claims
coming from sort of traditional industrial clients that's have been with us for quite a while.

Q - Alexander Evans

{BIO 19956412 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Operator
And then the next question comes from the line of Matti Ahokas from Danske Bank.
Please go ahead.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. I have two questions from my side, please. Firstly on the dividend.
Could you a bit elaborate on the Board's view on paying a dividend at the time when
both the EIOPA and also the Finnish FSA recommended insurance companies not to pay
dividends. I guess you took this into account in the proposal, but obviously it is quite
extraordinary in the current circumstances that would be the ﬁrst question.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Sorry I was on mute. I agree with EIOPA that these are times when you should be careful
with your balance sheet and but you will have seen that our solvency ratio has developed
well and even increased since before the crisis. And of course we have had a dialog with
the Finnish FSA and decided -- The Board has decided to propose this as a balanced view
given the fact that Nordea and Topdanmark will not be paying -- have not paid the
dividend that we were expecting from the spring.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

FINAL

Great. Thanks. The second question is on the non-life side. One of your competitors was
talking about claims frequencies in motor and also burglaries down by 15% to 30% in
March. Is this a ﬁgure that you would agree with? And how does Q2 look like at the
moment? Obviously, we've seen the lockdown impact in the Nordic countries with full
force mainly in April? So if you could give us some kind of light on how the claims
frequency outlook has developed in April? That would be great. Thanks.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Yeah. I would -- I agree to that general sort of trend and also the description that claim
frequencies in motor in Q1 or the last 2 weeks of Q1 has been down some 15%, 20% even
a bit more than that in certain weeks, varying a bit between countries obviously. And then
of course this continues also in April, and even though we have seen a certain uptick in
traﬃc on the roads over the last couple of weeks. And yeah.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

And the next question comes from the line of Derald Goh from Citigroup. Please go
ahead.

Q - Derald Goh

{BIO 20775137 <GO>}

Afternoon all. Hope you're keeping well. Key questions. So the ﬁrst one is just on
Mandatum. So solvency [ph] it seems quite strong. But I think there was some beneﬁt of
the canceled dividend. So I'm just curious there -- around your thoughts there because it
seems to me that even taking away the EUR1.50 dividend, the solvency would still be
actually at a level above the end of 2019.

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

Yes. That's correct. The canceled dividend in Mandatum contributed to an improvement
in the solvency ratio of roughly 16%. Then there were negative eﬀects obviously from the
equity value drops and also the fact that during the quarter, interest rates fell, but then
there were positive eﬀects oﬀsetting that and a bit more as you alluded to, from the
change in the symmetric adjustments and also the fact that Mandatum applies diﬀerently
from if, for example, the volatility adjustment as well.
So those two technical factors, according to the Solvency II regulation contributed to the
improved solvency ratio on Mandatum even when excluding the canceled dividend.

Q - Derald Goh

{BIO 20775137 <GO>}

So I guess the question is that, was there any other reason as to why you had canceled the
dividend?

Company Ticker: SAMPO FH Equity
Date: 2020-05-06

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

FINAL

The -- there's no other reason than the fact that with the balance sheet of Mandatum, we
felt it was prudent to keep a signiﬁcant solvency capital base on that balance sheet during
now the volatility that we have and have in the ﬁnancial markets and obviously also
Mandatum take into considerations, the communication that has come in from EIOPA and
the Finnish regulator exactly as Torbjorn says that the Sampo Board has done.

Q - Derald Goh

{BIO 20775137 <GO>}

All right. Thank you. And second question is just on the interest rate sensitivity, it seems
that it's, like it's gone up quite a bit from year-end. I think especially in the interest rate
down scenario. Any reason for this, were there some kind of investment portfolio
adjustments that you made during the quarter?

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

No, no signiﬁcant adjustments during the quarter, which impacts that. It has of course also
to do with the share size since we're talking about sensitivities on the solvency ratio, the
share size of the down funds and the SCR both which have shrunk during the quarter.

Q - Derald Goh

{BIO 20775137 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Got it. And one last question for Morten. So I think you mentioned the growth has been
very strong which is mainly rate driven. And I think you alluded to the end of March where
growth slowed somewhat. So what are you seeing in April in terms of the growth in
prices? And then on the commercial side, what happened at the April renewals and
what's the other there in terms of maintaining the rate momentum?

A - Morten Thorsrud

{BIO 16111627 <GO>}

Yeah. Well we do of course expect to see as I said some headwind on the growth going
forward. And one could for instance sort of point that things like new car sales. If you take,
sort of the largest country Sweden and the sort of kind of oﬃcial forecast that Sweden
gives out was reduced from 320,000 down to 270,000 cars.
On the Nordic level, already the year started a bit weak, so we had minus 9.4% in number
of new cars being sold after February. That ﬁgure sort of increased to minus 15.2% after
March. So of course, we do see an impact in terms of reduced new car sales that will aﬀect
premium income within private. But in business area commercial, we do see that some
customers are making adjustments to their terms and conditions. For instance, as a result
of our fewer employees so that will have a certain impact. And then similarly, we expect
the same materializing to industrial perhaps with some delay into the industrial market.
But again, we do expect to see some headwind on the growth. And when that is said, of
course, the P&C insurance industry is pretty resilient and when it comes to sort of how it
operates also in the downturn. So -- and again I think it's good for us to having started at
least the year with 7% growth. It gives us then an ability to handle sort of what we might
see in terms of a bit more negative growth prospects going forward.

FINAL

Thanks for that. So just a small additional point, any comments on what you saw in the
April renewals. I think heading into it there's a lot of talk about the need to push for more
rates coming from a very -- from a prolonged soft market. Did the rate momentum in April
continued from January into April. And do you think it will continue going forward?

A - Morten Thorsrud

Yeah. I don't want to talk too much about Q2, but I think we haven't seen any signiﬁcant
change with respect to that so far at least.

And the next question comes from the line of Blair Stewart from Bank of America. Please
go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Good afternoon, all. I've got a couple of questions left. Most of
them have been -- have been asked. Just a technical one for Knut Arne. First, the ﬁxed
income impairments coming through the income statement. Why did those happen? Was
that due to assets that you sold and therefore crystallized a loss or was there cash ﬂow
type impairments coming through? That's the ﬁrst one actually. Just asked that one ﬁrst
and then I'll come back if I can?

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

All right. Good afternoon, Blair. No, we didn't impair assets that we sold, so to speak, so
it's not a loss because of disposal. It is impairments in assets that we still hold. So we
haven't sold an after-impairment either. The impairments of ﬁxed income includes an
element of management judgment diﬀerent from equities which we impair when there is
a diﬀerence between observable market value and book value of 20% which is the limit in
Sampo Group.
So there is element of management judgment. We haven't done much impairments in
ﬁxed income, haven't had a need to do that over the years. This year as we did this
quarter, we look at certain assets within the energy sector, we don't have a large exposure
to assets within that sector in the ﬁrst place. But for the assets we do own, we saw a need
to make an impairment because both our view of all those assets and also that the market
value of those assets were signiﬁcantly below our book value.
So that -- it's about EUR50 million. It represents roughly a quarter or the exposure we
have to the energy sector within the Group.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Are those asset values recovered since the end of the quarter?

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

FINAL

Some of those asset values have recovered not to the level of where we -- where we
impaired it from.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Yeah. Okay ﬁne. Thank you. And just one more question actually maybe for Torbjorn on
just reﬂecting on the dividend policy. It seems that you've got, you've got two streams of
cash ﬂows in the business, one of which coming from the insurance businesses, which
hopefully is quite stable and dependable. And then arguably a stream from Nordea that
might not be as stable and dependable depending on what happens in the world. Does
that form part of the Board thinking when thinking about a dividend, you mentioned
earlier that you don't have any ambition to pay a stable and steadily rising dividend, for
example, you just allow the dividend to be what it is. But I wonder if within that there is a
stable element of the dividend that we can, that we can rely on and perhaps just a
passthrough approach to whatever you get from Nordea? I wonder if you could just
comment on that. Thank you.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Thank you. You expressed our thinking about the dividend policy a bit correctly. We
certainly have an ambition to increase the earnings of our businesses continuously and
that will be reﬂected in the dividend. I think it's a bit early to start speculating about the
dividend for next year. We have just come out with our proposal to this AGM and let's
leave it at that.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay. Maybe I didn't pick you up properly earlier Torbjorn because the line was a bit
disrupted, but I thought I heard you say that there is no expectation that there will be an
ever-increasing dividend or words to that eﬀect, is that right?

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

That's big -- yes, that is right. No promise that there will be an ever-increasing, increasing
the dividend. That's right, which is a promise that I cannot make

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay. So the dividend policy is really just based on a payout ratio depending on where
the earnings are, but I mean, clearly, cash ﬂows into the center matter as well when
thinking about dividend aﬀordability.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Yes.

And the next question comes from the line of Per Gronborg from SEB. Please go ahead.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. Still a couple of questions left from my side. First, a
clariﬁcation, travel insurance, your EUR10 million own risk on your reinsurance program.
How long time does this cover, does that also cover potential massive cancellation over
the summer or do you have to renew it start from scratch again at some stage?

A - Morten Thorsrud

{BIO 16111627 <GO>}

Yes.Per, I think that depends on whether we will consider this as being one event or
whether there will be multiple events going forward. As long as we are in the current
status with one lockdown, we do absolutely look upon this being one event. Of course,
you might have a scenario of -- where we are open -- opening up again for traveling and
then that later, we close down again. And then, of course, it will be a new event. But so far
this is considered as one event and it covers sort of the claims that will be reported sort of
as a result of this event.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Okay, perfect. My second question on the dividend and the payout versus proﬁt. Clearly,
we have probably an all-time high, but close to all-time high diﬀerence between net proﬁt
and compensing proﬁt. How should we look at your payout versus the one or the other?

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

I think that today what we have done is just as I responded to Blair decided on the
dividend given a number of uncertainties in the market and the crisis situation in the
world, and we have decided on what is the prudent and balanced dividend for this year.
What will happen next year and going forward is very early to speculate about and we
hope that the world will be a simpler world and easier to interpret based on the 70% of
earnings policy that we have and that's probably the best answer that I can give you
under these circumstances.
Knut, would you like to add anything to that?

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

No. The dividend policy is, of course, related to reported earnings, the dividend policy
currently in force. Then it is -- and I would agree with Torbjorn, it is of course after Q1, a
very big diﬀerence between that and the mark to market, let's see how that develops
during the year and what consideration we then make mind you it is of course at least
70% of reported earnings that as we have in the dividend policy, which is AFS earnings.

Thank you. And Hey, I'll stop myself -- bigger problem. Thank you so much for taking my
questions. On the dividend, and I'm sorry, to go back and is not, it's just that I need to -- I
should really try to understand it better. The 70% applies to proﬁt you said, but is it the -- I
didn't quite understand which proﬁt line -- is it the proﬁt which I consider which is
excluding mark-to-market or is it the proﬁt after the mark-to-market?

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

It's net AFS earnings sir

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 21454754 <GO>}

Okay. So it includes the mark to market volatility.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 21454754 <GO>}

Just to make it clear -- I think you reported about. Sorry.

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

The dividend policy is related to AFS earnings. So that would include things like the
impairments that we have done, but it would not include the changes in the fair value of
reserve.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 21454754 <GO>}

Brilliant. Excellent. Okay. Sorry, I was, I was unclear on that and hadn't thought about it. So
thank you very much. And my other question is really about the combined ratio. Now I'm
going to put words in your mouth, and you're going to hate it, but it looks to me as if the
Group over the many years and I haven't followed it that long but has actually had a
ratchet in terms of combined ratio and combined ratio guidance. I don't --deﬁnitely the
guidance has either been ﬂat or improved and the actual combined ratios has tended to
improve. I think there was maybe one year where it went up a little bit or a couple of
years, but really minimally. And so I got really excited when I saw you reduced -- you've
improved your guidance further to 84%, 87% and here my question is given your

comments on pricing and volumes, et cetera. Is this something that you see as sustainable
beyond this year?

FINAL

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Maybe I'll start, Morten. We have for more than the past decade been able to improve the
cost ratio for If P&C every year. We have improved the combined ratio gradually over the
year, the same time or even longer than that. And it's our ambition to do that by
improving the underwriting of course and being more and more competitive in the
market. I see no reason to stop that ambition.
Then we have the market situation, which has improved in general compared to three or
four years ago, and the market is now dominated by relatively few insurers in the Nordic
region. So that is also supporting this statement. Morten?

A - Morten Thorsrud

{BIO 16111627 <GO>}

Yes. And I agree to that. And as I said, initially I think, I mean the Nordic P&C insurance
market, it is a rational market with some combined ratio levels and these are kind of
combined ratio levels that we need in an environment where of course, we are not
expecting a very high return on the investment side. And so we expect to be disciplined
on also on the underwriting going forward.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 21454754 <GO>}

Fantastic. And if I may just ask a follow up but it's really more kind of detailed. If I think the
-- of 84% 87% and the 83.7% you reported in Q1. I mean I can do the maths and think well,
you could land in the middle of that and have ratios in the rest of the year which are more
volatile or you could achieve the low end and have kind of a more sustainable number
every quarter. And just obviously I don't want -- to put words in your mouth, if you don't
give guidance. I thought you are careful, I hate to that, but in our thinking when you said
the 84%, 87%, was it more. Yes, this is sustainable pricing competition rational et cetera.
Or it did -- in there did you kind of say and actually Q1 and the beginning of Q2 was
looking so good. We -- it gives us a kind of extra boost which we can put in the number?

A - Morten Thorsrud

{BIO 16111627 <GO>}

I think we don't really want to give much more guidance than the guidance that we gave
sort of which is 84% to 87% as a full year guidance on the combined ratio. Obviously, as
you also stated, I mean, we now know that the utcome for Q1 was a quite favorable
outcome of 83.6%. So of course, we factor that in when making the outlook.

Q - Johan Strom

{BIO 17541253 <GO>}

FINAL

Thank you. Two questions from my side as well. First, and I'm sorry if I missed any
comments or announced activity on this, but I was wondering how you think about -- I
think it's SEK3 billion of senior bond maturities coming up in late May. Are you looking for
a reﬁnancing of this and how responsive do you think the market is for that?
Then secondly, it will be interesting to hear what you think about the solvency position at
the Group level. Now I think end of April number of 187% certainly gives you a very strong
capital position. But what would be, call it the minimum level in this uncertain market?
Thank you.

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

Good afternoon. It's Knut Arne here. The SEK3 billion of senior, we always think around
our funding taking market conditions into perspective as well as maybe how markets are
now and we have planned our liquidity. This is a senior bond, so it's not capital. It's pure
liquidity. We have planned our liquidity in a way that there is no reﬁnancing need for
Sampo for that particular bond those two tranches, which is due now later in May. That's
my answer to your ﬁrst question.

Bloomberg Transcript

And I think you described our solvency position well as strong, I think it is prudent to have
a strong solvency position with the volatility we have with the low visibility on how
ﬁnancial markets will develop going forward. And also to be able to use the opportunity
of that might arise in such market volatility when asset value changes.
I would be careful because of what I just said to put a minimum number right now I am
happy with having a high number to solvency ratio as we speak.

Q - Johan Strom

{BIO 17541253 <GO>}

Thank you very much. And just bridging that one -- sorry the end of March, number 187%,
what's the diﬀerence there. Is that mainly the Nordea share price? If there's anything else
that we should watch? Thank you very much.

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

Yeah. That's mainly the Nordea share price and then we had a big help on other equity
prices as well, but that was canceled out, right, by a little negative eﬀect from change in
interest rates. So net-net, it's basically the Nordea share price that contributes to that 8%
or so improvement in the solvency ratio during last month.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two please. So ﬁrstly, on the dividend policy,
I think we've had a few snippets. I think I was a bit confused at the start. I think I
understand it now, but I just like to kind of summarize what you said and just ensure we're
on the right page. So basically, I think the EUR1.50 for this year is prudent, somewhat
exceptional given what's going on. Sticking to the 70% policy, there is no ratchet, it's
clearly too early to think about 2020 dividends, but you're not saying that the EUR1.50 is a
new, a new starting point to think about. So just any yes or no commentary there would
be great. And then secondly on the underlying loss ratio. I mean, -- yes, it's good
development. You're not ﬂagging any fundings in there, it sounds like it's relatively clean
which given you've been pricing out of claims inﬂation for most of last year. I expect it to
be running that way for this year. I mean that was quite a bullish outlook for the margin. I
would think so again any color there would be great. Thank you.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

And on the ﬁrst question, I am grateful for your summary. And I'd say yes on that one.

A - Morten Thorsrud

{BIO 16111627 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And then on your second, on the underlying loss ratio. On one hand, yes, we have seen a
clear improvement in the underlying frequency ratio. Going forward, it's of course always
a diﬃcult thing to speculate.
We do expect and we do see somewhat high claims inﬂation also over the last few
months and of course we look carefully at the claims inﬂation going forward. Where there
might be some extraordinary eﬀects also in the middle of this COVID-19 situation sort of -so looking at the claims inﬂation at the body shops, for instance, this is important for us.
So I think I'll not speculate more about the future than that.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Thank you. So that as far as I guess is the broad comment that you saw pricing in line to
slightly ahead of claims inﬂation, does that still hold?

A - Morten Thorsrud

{BIO 16111627 <GO>}

Yes. I think slightly above what we have seen as kind of -- yes claims inﬂation over the last
couple of years, slightly above that.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes, good afternoon. Jan Erik Gjerland from ABG. Just some couple of questions, just
more technical I would say. The life solvency looks to be slightly lower without the
transition rules. So I just wonder how is the Group solvency also including in these kind of
transition periods for any levels? And secondly, on the life side, is there any sort of
minimum you would like to have been without -- before considering the dividend stream
from your life company once more?
Thirdly, on your impairments, will it be fair to say that you have done everything, you have
to do now on an impairment on your ﬁxed income side, or is there more to more come in
the second quarter, as banks going forward when they comes to -- looks for their
impairments. I still see that you have ﬁxed income at the low (inaudible) at least in the
mark-to-market reserves on the Page 13 in the supplementary. So any light on that would
be great. Thank you.

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Good afternoon Jan Erik. I should start with the life solvency if I understood your question
correctly, the live solvency of 205%, we don't had -- there is no pending dividend
proposal from the Board at that level. But obviously it is, it is a stronger solvency even
excluding the EUR1.50 earlier proposed dividend which we -- the board canceled that
proposal.
It's a stronger solvency than what we had in year-end. So if the visibility increases so of
course the possibility for Mandatum to pay the dividend at around that level will be
current solvency base I would say it should be there.
The Group doesn't apply any transitional rules that what you see is what you get there on
the solvency ratio, so to speak.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

That was your second question on impairments, but I wish we had the crystal ball mill in
impairments and again, I'm not trying to sort of the funding, the question is a very
relevant question. I just can't say if there will be a need for more impairment.
But I can say that when we look when we made the estimates for April, to give you those
three data points of April. There were no need to consider it neither on the equity side,
which is quite clear, nor on the ﬁxed income side, at that point in time to do further
impairments, but that is not promise for Q2 for reasons you understand.

Company Name: Sampo Oyj
Company Ticker: SAMPO FH Equity
Date: 2020-05-06

No. If you say this 20% mismatch between the book value and the market, at least on the
equity side, do you have any comments kind of internal level of guidance when it comes
to what it should be between the ﬁxed income mark-to-market and what you have built it
for?

FINAL

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

No. We don't have a guidance for that. That's not high as 39, it's being weak then so to
speak. It's management judgment the impairments we did had a diﬀerence which was
signiﬁcantly above 20% obviously, there is, of course, a diﬀerence with equity and ﬁxed
income investment where you basically need to have a default of a ﬁxed income
investment to not be able to record the AFS result as predicted, ﬁxing as long as its direct
investment income is to say ﬁxed-income assets is still paying, but because it was a
signiﬁcant diﬀerence it was above 20% clearly above 20% we made that impairment.
When we close our books Q2 and if there are signiﬁcant diﬀerences also there we, of
course, need to make that management judgment also in that point in time, but like I said
in April even though there were ﬁxed-income assets which -- the diﬀerence were above
20%, we didn't see a need to make in impairments in terms of the predictability of the
cash ﬂow from that asset.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Good afternoon. Thank you. Just a couple of questions, I wonder I don't know if you've
explained this before but could you just go through it again on the symmetric adjustment
in your solvency ratio, and how the movement in equity prices going down to minus 30%
is a signiﬁcant drop in your solvency. How the symmetric adjustment plays a role here?
And how there's doesn't seem to be any movement in the equity dampener coming
through as well? And then can you tell me how comfortable Sampo is running its business
in the 140% solvency? Thank you.

Company Name: Sampo Oyj

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

FINAL

Maybe as you're thinking about the more technical question, I'll just say that 125% is of
course a ﬂoor two where you can comfortably around anything. What 140% means that
depends entirely on the situation. But we have previously said that below 140A% to 145%,
you get limited room for maneuvering the Company if there were opportunities.

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

I totally agree. And just one additional on that from my side as well. It's not a target for the
solvency ratio for the Group that's never what we have described it as. The symmetric
adjustment, even if I understood your question correctly, it works like this, that when there
are market movements up and down, there is adjustments to the risk factor that's applied
to equities.
And the risk that given the signiﬁcant market drops, the risk factor, the symmetric
adjustment reduced the risk charge on equities from around 39% that's on year. And
when the same metric adjustment was very close to zero to 29% as of end of the ﬁrst
quarter. When the symmetric adjustment was minus 10. The symmetric adjustment -formula for the sym metric adjustment basically makes it stop there.

Bloomberg Transcript

So when you have further drops, I think you mentioned 30%, you had no further held
companies have no further held neither Sampo of course from the symmetric adjustment.
And consequently, the sensitivities to equity in such a scenario increases that's also why
the sensitivity for equities that we have published is diﬀerent from the ones we had in our
disclosures in Q4.
Similarly, of course, if equity markets increases under symmetric adjustment comes into
play, again, it will have a negative impact on the solvency ratio as the risk, as the charge
where equities increases with the symmetric adjustment. And this is applied to the whole
equity portfolio and it is also applied for solvency purposes on our exposures towards
Nordea.

Q - Jon Denham

{BIO 19972914 <GO>}

Thank you.

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

I think I could also add on one comment on that sort of I think internationally, there has
been a lot of speculation on this on motor insurance in particular and the Nordics is
especially in the way that motor insurance in the Nordics is generally priced based on
expected daily mileage. So if people expect to drive signiﬁcantly more or signiﬁcantly less
than what is assumed in the pricing, they have always been able to adjust that. So it's a
quite diﬀerent situation in the Nordics than what you have been quite many other
geographies.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 21454754 <GO>}

Thank you. It was one on pricing and one symmetry. An pricing, what was the number in
Q1, which was included in the slightly increased premiums of 7%. And then on symmetry,
say this is just a hypothetical markets return to the level of the start of the year, equity
markets. Would it mean that solvency would go down from the current level, the 187% as
of April. Thank you.

A - Morten Thorsrud

{BIO 16111627 <GO>}

Could ask your ﬁrst question then -- and the growth of 7% as I stated initially in this
conference. We say that roughly support to 40-60 split where then the larger part i.e 60%
is price increases and the 40% is then increase in business volume, sort of number of
customers, number of insured WX and so forth.

course, on how our portfolio would look and what we would do in terms of transactions if
we have increased visibility and gradual more account for it in the equity markets, et
cetera. But everything else equal, a 20% -- now, it's a little bit less, but just let me take that
number, since we after all, are talking about Q1 results and where we were a month ago.
20% increase in equity markets would roughly have about a couple of percentage point
negative eﬀect on our solvency ratio.
