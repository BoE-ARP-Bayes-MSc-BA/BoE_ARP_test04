{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

Good day, everybody, and thank you for joining us.
We felt it appropriate to bring you up to speed on how the business is responding given
the external environment we're in. It's been a while since we've done a quarterly update,
but appreciate you joining us. We're not going to continue to do these on a scheduled
basis, but if the climate -- environment continues, we'll keep these updates coming. And
as you know we had our AGM today, our first virtual AGM in almost 200 years. So, we
thought it'd be appropriate time to bring you up to speed.
Let me start with some brief opening remarks, and then we'll follow it by two comments
from Michael Falcon, CEO of our U.S. business and Nic Nicandrou, Head of PCA for us, and
then we'll open up to questions, and also the Prudential team, I'm joined by Mark
FitzPatrick and Nic Nicandrou. We also have James Turner, the Chief Risk Officer; Michael
Falcon, again; Axel Andre, who is our CFO of the U.S., and Raghu is joining us as well from
Asia on -- so, we have both CFOs of the major business units as well.
So, our immediate priority, I think, as you're probably hearing a lot of management teams
and when this first started the needs of our colleagues, our agents, and distribution

FINAL

model, customers obviously, and then the -- where we could have impact on the
community for -- and make sure we're delivering all those run concurrently and in speed. I
think we are to-date doing all of that.
We've performed well through, I think, what's been a substantial disruption and obviously
a lot of market volatility. I think it demonstrates the strength of the business model that
we bring into the capital, and particularly uniquely, I think our operational capabilities or
digital capabilities.
In Asia, two-thirds of our products now could be sold without face-to-face interactions,
and again that's based on the first quarter sales mix, and we've utilized our digital
platform for issuing 1.2 million policies during this time, and majority of which were new
customers, and we continue to roll out our digital ecosystem Pulse. Pulse is now live in
eight markets. We've seen 4 million downloads and the benefit of our diverse portfolio is
evident, I think, from ever increasing sales and double-digit sales growth and new
business profits, and markets outside of China and Hong Kong -- China and Hong Kong.
The impacts of COVID-19 and social restrictions there hits first and they led to lower new
business profits -- excuse me, lower new business sales and profits. And importantly, our
in-force business remains resilient. Our renewal premium base continues to compound,
driving earnings growth at 14% over the first quarter across Asia, and we invested heavily
in Asia again this period, the bank assurance deals in Thailand and Laos. We continue to -Japan's second payment on the ULB relationship and committed over $1 billion capital to
the region for inorganic expansion of our capabilities. In the U.S., operations for minority
ideal continue on side our active valuation to other options as we move towards an
independent Jackson and we've committed to provide an update with our half year
results in August.
Over the extraordinary value of first quarter, Jackson's this program in place the RBC ratio
finished the quarter in a 340% to 365% range. Again, that's only marginally below the
level of beginning of the year, and we've managed our investment portfolio quite
conservatively. They are not stretching for yield as we've discussed many times and
significantly increasing our cash and U.S. Treasury Holdings in the period, and netting out
20% of portfolio on that basis.
We've managed a good balance sheet and liquidity carefully, and we successfully access
the U.S. debt market -- in U.S., and finally our solvency both of the group business remains
robust. As of 31st of March, the group had an estimated LCSM surplus of $11.1 billion in a
ratio of 302%. So, we see resilience, diversification and prospects for long-term growth
coming in our Asian businesses. We'll continue to invest and innovate to meet the
important needs of our customers with a highly resilient business model and we're well
positioned over the long-term to weather the disruptions caused by this COVID-19
pandemic, and to support our customers and the communities we're in and the recovery
regardless of that shape.
So, next I'd like to hand it over to Michael Falcon, CEO Jackson, and then Nic Nicandrou,
CEO PCA to make some brief prepared comments on how things are going for their

Page 2 of 20

customers, staff, businesses, and then we'll go to questions for the bulk of the hour.
So, firstly, Michael.

{BIO 17026942 <GO>}

Great. Thanks, Mike, and good morning/good afternoon to everybody. Thank you for
joining the call.
Look, Jackson performed well in the first quarter, I think, showing resilience in what Mike -as Mike said was the volatile and challenging environment. Our statutory capital increased
by over $3 billion in the quarter to almost $8.4 billion at March 31, and our operating capital
generation remained in line with our expectations. From a credit exposure perspective,
we began the year well-positioned and continue to carefully monitor and actively manage
the portfolio, and critically important, Jackson's business operations have remained fully
functional even as roughly 95% of our associates are working remotely, we remain
connected to each other, our clients, markets and key partners, and we've maintained
service and quality at historically high levels.
Sales in the quarter were strong compared to a year ago levels, although we did see a
slight decline compared to fourth quarter '19. I'd note that VA origination in the quarter
increased both year-on-year and sequentially that was offset somewhat by fixed annuity
and fixed index annuity volumes, when we compare to the fourth quarter last year. Given
market and rate conditions, we took pricing actions on fixed and fixed index annuities late
last year and again in the first quarter. So, the lower volumes are expected, and they're
likely to continue in the months ahead. We've also initiated actions in our VA product line.
We expect to come into the market later this year that's subject to the regulatory
approval process.
Our long-standing approach to pricing discipline is intended to keep sales origination
aligned to both our risk and our return hurdle rates. As regards our in-force book, we
haven't seen any notable changes to policyholder behavior or overall asset mix in the
separate account book. A few words on sales activity; there's still no face-to-face
meetings taking place in the U.S. between our wholesalers and financial advisors. At least - fortunately, Jackson is digitally capable across our product range as are many of our
distribution partners, and we're continuing to write new business through this period.
Advisors -- financial advisors along with our external wholesalers are getting increasingly
comfortable with digital and video engagements, and we've seen virtual client meeting
counts increase meaningfully over the past several weeks as well as attendance in virtual
events. Long-term this creates some potential cost and scale efficiency for us, but I think
it's too soon right now to know exactly how that's going to play out. Overall, I'm very
proud of the way our associates and the Jackson leadership team have worked through
this extraordinary demanding period.
In closing, let me just highlight that it's during these periods of market stress and volatility
that the value of our products and services best come to light as both for advisors and
Page 3 of 20



Company N ame: Prudential PL C
Company Ticker: PRU L N Equity

their clients. Jackson's ability to manage effectively through these periods coupled with
our leading distribution franchise really means we're well positioned in the U.S. retirement
market, I think, for the months and years to come.

FINAL

With that, let me turn it over to Nic.

Nicolaos Andreas Nicandrou

{BIO 15589153 <GO>}

Thank you, Michael. Good afternoon, good morning, everyone. I hope that you are all
staying safe and healthy.

Bloomberg Transcript

PCA's efforts in the current volatile operating environment are focused on three key
areas. One, ensuring the safety of our staff; two, meeting the needs of our customers;
and three, digitizing our business model. For our staff, we put our business continuity
plans into action as movement restrictions were enforced across our 15 markets helping
over 12,000 of our more employees excluding JVs to work from home at literally the flick
of a switch. At the peak, 80% of our staff work from home. Today, this figure is around
60%. We have also provided masks and sanitizers to ensure that those employees, who
are at work, feel safe.
For our customers, we have responded to the needs and concerns in multiple ways, by
offering in-force customers COVID-19-related cover and benefits across all our markets,
by allowing grace periods on premium payments to enable customers in financial hardship
to retain their valuable protection cover. And lastly, by innovating to provide bite-size
health cover and by rolling out Pulse, our digital health services app in eight markets and in
six languages.
My preference by resilience first quarter sales and NBP performance outside Hong Kong
and China, with the latter in other words, NBP up 23%, reflecting both the portfolio
diversity and the demands of protection across the end markets. For mid-March however,
all our markets in addition to Hong Kong had imposed social restrictions, and even though
China saw an easing and a return to growth in April at plus 28%, these developments will
adversely impact our overall second quarter sales and NBP performance.
In response to these growing restrictions, we accelerated our efforts to digitize our
business model from front to back, by moving agent recruitment online, virtualizing the
sales process so that agents can sell non face-to-face launching digital bite-size products
in Pulse, and providing customers access to multiple electronic payment channels across
all of our markets.
As Mike said, two-thirds of our APE is now capable of being sold virtually, while we
recruited 40,000 new agents in the first quarter, up 11%. Complementing this capability -Pulse downloads, which provide a rich source of leads and have enabled digital customer
acquisition with 1.2 million micro Pulse directly the majority to -- Prudential customers.
Our China playbook, a rapid digitization and agent recruitment in February and March
enabled the business to benefit strongly than the recovery we saw in April, gives me
Page 4 of 20

confidence with the improvement in our digital capabilities across the rest of our markets,
positions us well to benefit from the eventual --.

FINAL

So, to conclude, the improvement in our sales capability will over time amplify the
traditional strengths of PCA's business, mainly strong capital, low asset side risks, and
higher customer retention to deliver sustainable, profitable growth.
With that, I'll hand you back to Mike.

Thanks Nic. So, I think Maxine, if you would -- let's open the session up to Q&A, so we
maximize the amount of time you guys have today to ask any specific questions you may
want. You know the breadth of the management team that's available to you there. So,
Q&A please, Maxine if we could.

(Operator Instructions). We have a question from Jon Hocking from Morgan Stanley. Your
line is now open.

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Thank you and good afternoon, everybody. I've got some 3 questions please, 2 on
Jackson and 1 on PCA. So starting with Jackson. On the fixed annuity products, the fixed
index annuity product which are our current strategy, the -- Jack, if you've got a telecom
mix and all those products, does that still looks sensible given what's going on with the
yield curve? And where the new business ROEs have presumably moved to, despite the
repricing? This is the first question.
Second question again on Jackson. I think at the year-end you made a comment that you'll
be looking at spreading the dividend payments back to PLC through the year at Jackson,
rather than the usual annual payment. Can you come up with when you expect to make
the first payment? And is that contingent on the statutory RBC ratio improving at Jackson?
And then finally just on Singapore, it was in the set of markets you called out for strong
performance in Q1. I just wondered whether that market is going to be particularly
impacted in Q2, given the lockdown is a little bit out of phase with the rest of Southeast
Asia? Thank you.

A - Mark Thomas FitzPatrick

{BIO 20178326 <GO>}

So, Michael, do you want do the first 2? And Nick, handle the Singapore question please.

FINAL

Yes, sure. So let me take the second one first. So the dividend remittance, I would actually
am going to put back to the Mark FitzPatrick, as it's a function of group policy, and I'm not
sure we're going to comment on that, but I'll let Mark FitzPatrick. I think that's more
appropriate that he handle that.
On the general account strategy in the FA and FIA, I think it's an important point, that's
something we've heard a lot investor meetings. Let me -- a couple of things. One is, the
strategy we talked about last year still holds, right. This idea of additional capital into
Jackson against diverse risk to realize covariance benefit is important. But we said all
along that the organic ability to move that in the short-term is somewhat limited,
principally given the size of our installed VA book and on how well that's performed
through markets. And that's true given the correction in market values we've seen.

Bloomberg Transcript

In the current environment -- and we did move last year when we had I think pretty good
success of establishing additional distribution platform relationships and actual sales on
fixed -- annuity and fixed indexed product. In terms of the first quarter activity and the
pricing and sort of a drop in those volumes, now I wouldn't read too much into that. One
is, while rates have come down and treasures have come down, corporate spreads have
widened too. And so we're comfortable with the business that we've written during this
time and particularly in the first quarter.
I think going forward, in the short-term, with rates where they are and as well as looking at
the capital position and the capital required to put up those products, we're expecting to
see lower levels and be priced accordingly. But I don't think long-term anything that we've
said relative to that strategy has changed. I think importantly, though, there's also a
commercial element to this, which is that our clients and our distribution really want a
more complete solution set for their clients across the annuity platform spectrum. And so
that includes fixed, fixed index, it includes the RILA products, which were process
exploring, and NVA as well which is our traditional strength.
Mark, on dividend?

A - Mark Thomas FitzPatrick

{BIO 20178326 <GO>}

Hi, John. It's Mark here. So on dividend, last year we said that we would look to spread
remittances over the course of the full year, rather then just taking them in the first half.
And last year, in traditional, I think we've taken -- tended to take dividends in June of the
year. And so that's why you don't see anything coming through in the first quarter. And I
think you'll be able to get to see the cash flow disclosures when we publish our interims in
August. It's been an extraordinary quarter that we're very mindful of where markets are
at, and look forward to be able to update you on level of remittances at the infant stage.

A - Michael Andrew Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

So, Nick on Singapore, please.

{BIO 15589153 <GO>}

Thanks, Mike. Good morning, John. So Singapore had a muted response to the COVID
outbreak in the first quarter. But the government just tightened up by introducing the
circuit breaker measures on the 7th of April. In fact, these measures will last until the 1st of
June at the earlier. Now as part of those measures, any face-to-face solicitation by agents
was prohibited. So agents, like everyone else, had to work from home. And whilst banks
were allowed to open because of the slowdown in foot traffic, both UOB and SEB closed
between a third and a half of their branches.
So that's how severe the restrictions were and how severely this has hit Singapore now.
Immediately from the 1st of April we were able to launch all our products, every single one
of our products virtually, train all our agents, and they literally from 1 April were able to sell
face-to-face. The virtual activity stepped up as agents were trained and became far more
familiar with it, so much so that as of now every sale that is made in Singapore is on a
virtual basis.

Bloomberg Transcript

We rolled out the same technology to our bank partners, which is now also up and up and
running. Now all this to say is because the measures were quite severe and came in on
the 7 of April. Yes, the outlook for Singapore in the second quarter is more challenging,
until those -- the circuit breakers restrictions are lifted. Now, we're launching more
products that are more bite-sized easier to sell face-to-face.
As I said, a third of our agents with a virtual sale in April, and that number is increasing all
the time. And having launched Pulse, which was the latest in the market and we still
launched Pulse, that's producing is a rich source of leads, I referenced that across the
region is also true in Singapore, which we can sell to both directly online or referred to
agency downstream.

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Sure. Thank you.

We have a question from Kailash Mistri from HSBC. Your line is now open.

Q - Kailash Mistri
Hi, good evening, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up
on the virtual sales. So just to clarify, I think in the first wave of rules, virtual sales were only
applied to existing customers, but not to new customers. Has this now been rolled out or
have the regulations allowed this to be rolled out to new customers as well now? Second
question is on Pulse. What type of product mix are you setting on that? Is equivalent to
product mix in the respective countries where it's being sold from profitability and a
quality perspective?
And then lastly, just on the operating profit, 14% growth. Is there a big sort of positive
you've experienced there? Or is it significant? Because I guess most of the competitors
Page 7 of 20



Company N ame: Prudential PL C
Company Ticker: PRU L N Equity
Date: 2020-05-14

have been saying the region that plays for other types of illnesses, et cetera, have fallen.
So just a bit of color around the operating profit thing. Thank you.

FINAL

A - Mark Thomas FitzPatrick

{BIO 20178326 <GO>}

Okay. No -- so, new versus existing, in the -- I think in nearly all the markets virtual sales
came in. I can give you a run through market-by-market, they were allowed for both new
and existing products. So as I mentioned to Jon, earlier, in Singapore everything, and we
sold virtually both to new and existing, the same is true in Malaysia, the same is true in the
Philippines, the same is true in Vietnam, the same is true in China.
In Thailand, we can sell virtually face-to-face all products, except linked. In Hong Kong, we
can sell standalone protection products in qualifying Deferred Annuity Plan virtually, but
not products with an account value, which is what our evergreen say there is. In Indonesia,
we can sell products new and existing customers standalone protection virtually, but not
selling product with the account value. So that, as I just said, we came in pretty much for
new and existing everywhere. And the activity is picking up as we're a sitting member of
these countries. Most of the sales, as we sit here today, are now done virtually.

Bloomberg Transcript

To your second question on Pulse. The products that we are currently offering are purely
protection, and they are -- there if you like to establish a second relationship with a
customer or with a user that simply -- that maybe for now has just downloaded the app
and was using Babylon symptom checker, health assessments, using the telemedicine. So
what we're doing is that we're pushing small limited duration products, whether it's
personal accident, whether it's a daily fever type product, whether it's Chilton [ph] term
life, whether it's COVID cover, in case you're diagnosed or hospitalized.
Those are the products that we are selling. Some of them are done on a premium basis,
others are done on very low case size. But as I said, at this point it's just to establish a
second relationship before we could -- before we can offer either hire price products or
indeed ultimately refer them to either an offline or a virtual sales to one of our agents.
And on your operating profit question. I mean, there was some extra benefit coming
through from a lower normal, if you like, claims count. Not significantly so. It wasn't until
March that we saw across our portfolio a 15% reduction in the medical claims count
relative to our normal run rate, that's up further in April, we saw a reduction in the claim
count in April by -- across our portfolio by around 30%. So there is some effect but not
that significant in the Q1 earnings. In the meantime, the claims that we paid for COVID
cases continue to be minimal, to a few million dollars.

Q - Kailash Mistri
Thank you.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

FINAL

Thank you. A couple questions for me as well. Just coming back to the U.S., just wondered
if you can comment on the conflict between sales growth and preserving cash and capital,
I was slightly surprised to see the VA sales up in the quarter. And added to that, could you
maybe comment on the new VA product that you filed, how is that different?
Second question in the US would be linked to hedging costs, you've reported I think $500
million incremental hedge spend over the last few years. I just wonder if the run rate of
that has maintained that the same level or if it has changed? And thirdly, could you
perhaps talk about Thailand, you saw it as an opportunity, what does the acquisition do to
your scale and ambition in Thailand? Thank you.

A - Mark Thomas FitzPatrick

{BIO 20178326 <GO>}

Michael, why don't you talking about sales, and actually let's put you to work, we've got
you on the call as well on hedge cost, and the normal tension that exists in the capital
deployed by product type versus sales growth. And then Nick, quick overview on what we
like about Thailand and why we keep expanding there?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Michael Andrew Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

Yes. So -- hey Blair, thanks for the question. So, sales -- that's right, I totally follow the
question relative to --capital relative to VA. VA tends not to have a lower capital drag, and
the increase in VA sales in the first quarter really followed the momentum that we saw
through the balance of last year. So it was built on an increase. And so the quarter-onquarter versus first quarter year ago, which was at very, very low levels historically has built
up throughout last year and we just saw a continuation of that in -- through March. And
clearly, by the middle of March we started to see new activity tail off as the country went
into lock-down. And we suggested that that's going to continue and we expect lower
levels, particularly in the second quarter and for some time. But there was still a backlog
of pending cases and work to do, that was cleared through March and the beginning part
of April.
On the capital side, I mean that's the issue particularly around the spread business and on
FA and fixed-index annuity. And as we ramped up, you'll recall, last year we introduced
new product and distribution partners on the fixed annuity mid-year and fixed index in
January, February and those volumes built throughout the year of kicking really in our third
quarter. So the second half of the year in fixed and fixed index was much greater than the
first half of the year. We saw a tapering of that in the last year, and you saw it in the fullyear results, there is a capital drag on new business and I think we talked about it in the
call earlier this year. That drag is greater in the first year when you're writing higher levels
of business. So if you look back, one of the capital charges was adjusted up if you're
writing more of the business-type than you had previously.
So as you would anniversary those levels of higher activity, you would have less of that
incremental capital drag. We're not -- when you compare first quarter this year to last
year, we're still at higher volumes than where we were, so that look back is still in there.

Page 9 of 20

FINAL

And so we're paying -- we pay attention to not just the profitability on that but the capital
component to given where RBC and our current capital position is as well.
In terms of the new VA product that we've filed, we haven't -- maybe I misspoke earlier in
my comments, but we're filing -- we need to file product changes, a certain product
changes through the regulatory process, mostly with the SEC for product changes on the
VA relative to security. And so so those -- I think those are actually going in within the next
-- if they haven't gone in already within the next day or so. So it takes time for them to run
through. But once they're filed and become public, they'll become public.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thanks.

A - Mark Thomas FitzPatrick

{BIO 20178326 <GO>}

I don't know, if you want to turn back, so maybe you want to talk about the reference to
the incremental spend that we did last year, and where sort of hedging costs are right
now?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Unidentified Speaker
Yes, sure. Hi, Blair, this is [ph]. So yeah, the hedge cost question, I would say that, yes, the
first quarter was clearly a more volatile quarter, the price for things like equity options or
anything that's an option related derivative was elevated. So incrementally we did spend a
little more on that. I would say, offsetting that or as a counter point to that, we really
entered the period at the end of the year with a significant option book already on the
balance sheet. So as the quarter occurred and as the markets started to trade down,
essentially a lot of our options became in-the-money. So we saw a lot of gains, obviously,
on the derivatives and a lot of actual hedge payoffs with derivatives maturing.
And then the underlying exposure on the liability really became a lot more linear. So the -we were able to -- the incremental hedging was more in the form of futures rather than
the options. With nonetheless, yes, this was a quarter where hedge costs were more
elevated than normal. Again, we priced for this very -- and then we assessed the hedge
cost over a long period of time, over the life of the product. And we're still comfortable
with what we're seeing there.

A - Michael Andrew Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

Relative to -- I'd like to agree to the 500 that we referenced last year, I think that was very
specific to the issues related to moving between regimes. And obviously, moving
between regimes at a time when rates were volatile, we go back to -- of you remember,
back to August, September of last year. At least what we thought was volatile and large
swings in rates and equities at the time, not what we've seen, obviously, in March of this
year (inaudible).

Okay. So Thailand is a market where historically we've been underweight, both on the
asset management side, and in fact we were not present there. And also on the life side,
we've also -- we've had to shelve somewhere between 3% and 4% now. For one of them,
for a market which is ASEAN's second largest economy, 70 million people, a market
where the demand for savings and investment is growing, has grown and will continue to
grow at a double-digit rate, this was a gap.
This was a gap in our in our business, which is what we've invested to address over the
last few years, firstly by acquiring controlling states in two fund managers, which gives us,
based on the year-end stats, around 12% of the retailer UON in that market. And we've
cemented that by partnering with TMB to also serve the customers with traditional health
protection and savings, and savings products. Now TMB, following its merger with
Thanachart will be one of the largest banks there. And importantly, they look after 17% of
the country's adult population, so it's a serious relationship.
We now have a place with a bank that is very ambitious, very digitally marked there. And
what it offers us, and what I like about this particular deal, it gives us the opportunity to
actually bring both sides of the -- strength of both sides or our house, both the asset
management and the life are part of our house, bring it -- bring those in a combined way
to a single partner. Which we don't do that in any of the key partnerships that we have.
Now, that's going to be very powerful. Look, it has a potential on the life side. Once we're
up and running and we'll be exclusive with the entire TMB franchise from 1 January next
year, but it will give us the opportunity to make much faster progress in a very important
market. And hopefully go from a position that we've been, as I said, a 3% to 4% market
share position closer to 10% or so, and again, it's a great opportunity and one that we are
delighted to secure in March

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Q - Andrew Crean

FINAL

Thank you. Good afternoon. I've 3 questions, okay. Firstly, could you give us a bit more on
second quarter market for the non Hong Kong, China business? I knew it grew 1% in the
first quarter, can you -- there's a lot of market that's very difficult for us to get an
assessment. Can you give us a broad feel of how that's like in the second quarter?
Secondly, could you also talk in terms of the IPO. Is the current U.S. balance sheet strong
enough for an IPO in your view? You may need to strengthen it to put that through.
And then thirdly, you made comments on the 24th of March, it has starkly changed from
the messaging prior. You said that you're still pursuing your minority IPO as you look at
other avenues. Could you talk a little bit more about that? In particular, taking in whether
the other avenues are still limited by minority position or whether you would entertain
ideas about majority sale? Thank you.

A - Michael Andrew Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

So Nick, you want to take just the general -- very general feel of what Hong Kong,
Mainland China, is that coming back online? And then I'll address the other two.

A - Nicolaos Andreas Nicandrou

{BIO 15589153 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. So Andrew, I think you are you asking about the market outside China and Hong
Kong, right?

Q - Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Michael Andrew Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

Oh, I'm sorry, I misunderstood that, Andrew. I thought you're asking Mainland China.
Apology.

A - Nicolaos Andreas Nicandrou

{BIO 15589153 <GO>}

So -- I mean, just let me give you a color about what happened in Q1, and then to address
your point in relation to the near-term outlook. So we did see an imposition of movement
restrictions. We talked earlier in my answer, Singapore was 7th of April, in Malaysia it was
on the 20th of March, and Indonesia it was also around that time as well. So we -- or in
early April.
So we saw an imposition of movement restriction pretty much all of the market outside
China and Hong Kong. And that started from mid-March and they tightened as we got
into April. And for them for those markets that started being affected from mid-March, we
kind of arrested the double-digit momentum that we have, up until that point. Now all of
the businesses, and I'll talk in detail to Singapore, but I could have said the same thing
about all of them.

The businesses pivoted very quickly to the virtual sales tools, as I said, 100% of the
products to new and existing customers are now available virtually in Singapore, Malaysia,
Philippines, Vietnam, India. And actually recruitment moved online everywhere. And
agency hires were up 20% in all these markets, ex Hong Kong and China, in March; and
13% in April. So the virtual tools are allowing us to build out further distribution. All these
businesses also doubled down on the quality focus. So, I mean, you don't see it in the
numbers, but behind the 1% increase in the APE in Q1 was a 19% increase in health and
protection, moving the mix of health and protection in ex Hong Kong China markets from
mid 20s to low 30s.
We've had several launches of new protection, standalone protection propositions during
the first quarter and then into April and May, which is really the reason why the NBP fared
much better at plus 23% in Q1 with five markets double-digit. Now, yes, the near-term
outlet is challenged, as restrictions were in place pretty much everywhere through April.
As we sit here today, it's only Vietnam and Taiwan have eased; a couple more, Malaysia,
Thailand will start the easing later in May. But those Singapore, Indonesia, easing won't
happen in India, the easing won't happen until June.

Bloomberg Transcript

But if you like, the Q1 performance just shows what the power of this franchise is, if you
like, in a period which is mostly or totally undisturbed. So that hasn't gone away. And
everything that we've done since the lockdown, be it moving to more digitally enable the
business, when it comes to agent on-boarding and customer on-boarding, the broadest
suite of products that we're now launching that has -- that are more -- that have a higher
protection focus on a standalone basis, the 3.7 million Pulse downloads across these
markets that we've had, again, provide a rich vein of customer leads.
As I said earlier in my prepared remarks, they also give us the ability to positioning directto-consumer some of the simple products. All of these e will make it even better when
we have a return to normality. And I know you haven't asked about China, but China
effectively sets the template, China did everything that I've described, for the markets
that we've just been talking about, they went virtual, they incubated on products. And
then when things eased up, we saw a recovery of sales in March, and 28% growth in April.
So that is the template for all these are these other markets and we are using the same
playbook as China did in all of them.

Q - Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Nick, I suppose what I was after is a number, is it plus 28% the non-China Hong Kong?

A - Nicolaos Andreas Nicandrou

{BIO 15589153 <GO>}

No, the 28% was the -- sorry, just to be clear, I slipped to talking about -- in making the
point that I see no reason why we can't follow the same playbook in these markets as we
did in China. And I used the China growth in April of 28% to illustrate kind of the universal
power, the power of our franchise with all these additional strength in place when
normality returns.

Yes. Basically, Nick, I was simply asking a question, what is the equivalent number in
outside China and Hong Kong to the plus 28% that you gave us for China in April.

A - Nicolaos Andreas Nicandrou

{BIO 15589153 <GO>}

FINAL

It's much more challenged there, Andrew. Because we are in a lockdown, in the same way
of China was in February.

Q - Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

And the number? Because this is what's complete the Q1 metrics for now, not trying to do
a monthly update.

A - Michael Andrew Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So Andrew, on the U.S. piece, just one other dimension on the success that seems that in
Asia, particularly southeast Asia. We already have this working in China, but you've seen a
really strong pick up in the digital payment, automated payments. As you can imagine, as
these transactions get more digital, s they look much more like our Mainland business,
we're using digital payment technology away from cash which is a trend we've been
managing for years, but has had a nice pick up in the quarter as well.
So again, the number varies by market, but it's -- the consumer behavior is changing and
that's one of the elements. And then in the Pulse technology and most the markets there
is a digital payment capability, sometimes more than one. And that also gives us the ability
in some of the markets individual claims. And again, these sorts of things are what we
think will stick as consumer preferences for some part of the market post this current
COVID environment. So it's great to have the capability. I think it's better quality business
when it comes in on cash and comes up persistency with all good things.
And the question is on the U.S., so I know this is a frustrating answer for the full year, but
it's -- I'll give you a fairly similar one. We can't -- given where we are with SEC rules, we're
not -- we can't and aren't going to comment on timing or options and things in the U.S.
The reason I can't tell you where we -- well, we'll get to the broader answer is we, we'll
kind of prejudge the outcomes on what's the fastest or best path to an independent
Jackson.
And so there's obviously public and private sources of capital, there's different routes to
market and we've been very clear that's nothing -- nothing is off the table. And I can be
very clear here, this is -- we are talking about working in our strategic objectives, we'll
continue with the set pace. So that's not a -- but I can't give you specifics on that one. I
know that's frustrating, but we've got to be clear that we're inside of the line based on
what sort of choices make up. We're going to do something with the public filing. We can't
talk about it ahead of time.

We have a question from David Motemaden from Evercore. Your line is now open.

FINAL

Q - David Motemaden

{BIO 18818634 <GO>}

Hi, good morning, good afternoon. Just a few questions if I could on the U.S. capital levels.
First, I guess could you just talk about the moving pieces for the RBC ratio? Where you
said at March 24 that it was broadly similar to the 366 at year-end '19. When I look at
where it shook out this quarter, that it included about 25 point benefit from the CARES
Act, and that would have put it at 315 to 340, which is quite below the 366 level, when
you guys put out that March 24 press release. Just wondering what the driver was or the
drop versus between March 24 and Q1, if I strip out the tax benefit from the CARES Act?

Bloomberg Transcript

Second, just a more technical question maybe for Axel on just hedging the VA book. And I
know, a couple years ago you guys had started to move to buy treasuries to hedge
interest rates on the book, which a few of your U.S. peers have done this too, that I guess
there would be, I would assume if you did that there's a pretty big mark-to-market gain
that would not be reflected in the RBC ratio. So I'm hoping if you could sort of size that for
us so we could get a sense for how much the RBC ratio would have benefited if that gain
was realized?
And then just lastly for Michael, just a follow-up on the fixed index annuities sales and sort
of the outlook there. Just a question in terms of -- just wondering how much of capital
does a dollar of fixed index annuity sales consume, just to help us think about what sort of
tailwind the capital generation there could be as we progress through the year? Thank
you.

A - Mark Thomas FitzPatrick

{BIO 20178326 <GO>}

So, Michael (inaudible) framing and then Axel.

A - Michael Andrew Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

Yes. I was going to frame and then have Axel talk to the specifics. I can come back and
finish on the FAA outlook. So look, we're giving ranges on the RBC because these are
estimates, we only calculate this number officially once a year actually through the NAIC
software. We obviously monitor estimates and model it much more frequently than that.
And we've done the reporting in the RNS on the 24th now relative to end of the quarter,
given the sort of extraordinary events that we've been through, particularly in the month
of March and what markets are currently experiencing. So there's lots of puts and takes to
that number. I would say the biggest impacts that we've seen and there were changes
certainly even in the last week of March.
If you think back you had equities climbing, you had rates moving, you had credit spreads
coming back in, there's a number of factors. So you can look at the benefit computation
from the movement in the CARES Act application as of the end of the quarter. That's
really one of the elements, but there's a lot of other components there. And I think what
we're trying to show is the range and the relative stability to where we were at year end
Page 15 of 20

FINAL

and give some indication of the progression of that. I think the -- one of the important
things that I had -- we have this in the release and I highlighted in my comments earlier.
We did see additional statutory capital generation as you would expect and as you would
hope, I guess, during the period. So we're pleased with the way the hedging program is
designed and performed, and performed in a particularly stressful environment. We saw
peak to trough 30% declines, we saw in the quarter I think 25% decline in SMP, 20% or
25% SMP, 125 basis point drop in rates. The shortest corrections I think in both rates and
equities that we've ever seen in those markets. And we saw a statutory capital generation
and we saw capital generation in excess of what we saw in the increase in required capital
based on the model. And so those dynamics are holding and ultimately that's sort of I
think the basis behind the disclosure today. I'll let Axel, why don't you comment on that or
add to it or correct me if I'm off base, but also the question on the VA book.

A - Axel Andre

{BIO 19072099 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. So no, I think you summed it up well, Michael. There's fast moving pieces, but
obviously the big ones all equity, interest rates and credit spreads. On the treasuries, so
you have -- the treasuries are, they're part of the overall general account, they're part of
our overall A&M strategy, they play -- and they play a role therefore in the way that we
think about the VA economic risk. Yes, it's absolutely logical to think that those bonds are
in high gain positions currently and rather than talk about the specific number, I would just
point you to the group books that are due to come up shortly or its public right now, so
the numbers are there.

A - Michael Andrew Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

And on the FIA outlook. I don't know exactly how to tell you or direct you in terms of
information that we released on how to direct the FIA outlook for the year, other than to
say that we expect -- you saw what the volumes were in the guidance that we've given in
the first quarter and that the outlook, at least, currently given levels of activity and where
we move the pricing of the book, we would expect lower levels of FIA and FIA origination
to continue for some time
Order of magnitude, as I think back to last year in a broad range, a significant portion of
the capital drag on new spread origination was due to the increase in volume year-overyear, maybe plus or minus half of that, depending on how you look at it. But it remains to
be seen where rates move and how markets recover in the second half of the year.
Markets beating like sales activity will recover, we're already seeing a pickup in advisor
interaction with our external wholesalers and a level of engagement with end client.
In past cycles, it's taken 60 to 90 days to up to six-months if we go back to the financial
crisis to see field sales activity levels normalize. Again, I wouldn't point on the fixed index
and fixed annuity book, certainly the absolute level of treasury rates are important but the
investment rates, new money rates and corporate spreads figure that in as well. So we
have a decline of treasuries of 125 basis points and a widening of corporate spreads of
150 basis point which we had, you still have expansion of the underlying return. And that
has an impact on rate profitability to book as well. So again, we're trying to be realistic

Page 16 of 20



Company N ame: Prudential PL C
Company Ticker: PRU L N Equity
Date: 2020-05-14

given the environment we're in, in terms of COVID-19 and both market and commercial
activity. But I wouldn't read too much across on the FIA for getting one piece in particular.

FINAL

Q - David Motemaden

{BIO 18818634 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks Michael and Axel. And if I could just follow-up with Axel just one -- just
wondering, if you'd be willing to share the dollar amount of treasuries that you use to
hedge the VA book because? Because I think that that could be a pretty big benefit
depending on the size of it, that is not reflected in your RBC ratio.

A - Michael Andrew Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

David, it's Mick Wells. It is, but for those of you that are not familiar -- for those of you that
aren't fans of U.S. statutory accounting, the gains we have to be -- we sold all the
treasuries so they have to be amortized over the life effectively to come back into capital.
But you're right, the economic value is absolutely there, and given the 20 plus year
commitment to these consumers, again, with their investments first and they're very
effective hedge, and in particular GMWB withdrawal benefit. But it's a -- if you see the bill
books you can get a good idea of the percentage and the values, and it's pretty easy to
market for you to market, but I think that's it.
The other question, David, you asked on capital strain by product. If you just want some
general categories, and these vary by feature on the product. But think of VA somewhere
around 2% to 3% regulatory capital, fixed index somewhere in the 5% to 7%, and then the
fixed is somewhere between 7% to 9%. Again, depending on structure, duration, other
nature, that as an industry would be, without getting into our pricing model, that would be
sort of industry trends. So the more rigid the rate guarantee the more explicit the higher
the capital requirement by the U.S. regulators.

Mike, we've got a few minutes left. And I think we've just got space for a couple of more

We have a question from Scott Russell from Acquiring. Your line is now open.

Q - Scott Russell

{BIO 15107992 <GO>}

Hi, everyone. Good afternoon. Just two questions please. Firstly on Hong Kong, with sales
having halved in first quarter, that obviously makes the only income for an agent difficult.
Can you tell us how's the agent team holding together in Hong Kong? Particular perhaps
those agents who are Mainlanders join fairly recently and might not have that trail
commission coming through yet.

Second question is just about dividends and remittances. Obviously, banks have been told
by regulators to exercise caution around dividends. Just wondering to what extent all
regulators across the world are perhaps paying closer attention to your dividend and
remittance decisions at present? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Michael Andrew Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

So Scott, appreciate the questions. Let me put this to Mark Fitzpatrick first for the
dividend; and then Nick, if you want to talk about Hong Kong a little bit. But it's got
obviously now as of this year our regulators -- are lead regulator is in Hong Kong, not the
UK. And the regulatory college looks at it collectively, but Mark you want to go -- Mark,
actually James you too, but let Mark FitzPatric, why don't you start?

A - Mark Thomas FitzPatrick

{BIO 20178326 <GO>}

Certainly. Scott, hi. So in terms of the international regulators we have round the group,
the only one who has come out publicly and said anything around remittances is in India,
where the authorities effectively said no remittances for effectively the sector for the
majority of this year. The other regulators, as you would expect, we are in regular contact
with them. And the Hong Kong Insurance Authority is our group wide supervisor, has not
said anything publicly about any levels of remittances, pointing out that remittances are
for the company and the board to determine, provided they have the appropriate
solvency and liquidity to be able to pay them out.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Scott Russell

{BIO 15107992 <GO>}

And next is Hong Kong agent recruiting, retention, rookie versus a veteran, just a little
color on (inaudible) that sort of thing.

A - Nicolaos Andreas Nicandrou

{BIO 15589153 <GO>}

Sure. I mean, I think, yes, the veterans have trail commissions, and that is sustaining them
for a period where sales are not as high. I mean, clearly within a 24,500 agency force you
have, people that are more free time and those are still selling, I mean, they are selling, in
fact the top end of the agency force is selling almost same level of case count even
through this crisis. Where we are seeing the kind of lower activity is in the more part-time
agents. And I guess the reason they're part-time, and in fact the reason they are parttime is because they are selling products to supplement to their income as opposed to
the sole source of income.
So, there's a lot of activity that is taking place to ensure that agents complete all their
CPD requirements now whilst demand is lower, so that actually they can use all of their
time once the situation is up in the rest of the year to sell, getting them to update the
client profiles again so they can up-sell to clients. So there's a lot of activity where they're
not able to sell.
In terms of recruitment, actually the run rate of agent recruitment in the first quarter of
last year was about 500 a month, we have to recruited 600 in January, and then it got to
around 350 a month. But its only 15% down, but attrition is down by a-third. So our agency
count in Hong Kong is 11% up on what it was this time last year. So people are coming in
Page 18 of 20

with sales, we believe that once normality in terms of the demand will be there, both from
the domestic but also the mainland China market.
And the other thing, of course, that's we can now do that we weren't able to do before is,
having launched Pulse in Hong Kong towards the end of March, we have 400,000 users,
48% of those are new to good customers and we've already started the process. And
these are all domestic customers as we're assigning those leads to agents and looking to
deepen our relationship with those customers beyond being a Pulse user.

Q - Scott Russell

{BIO 15107992 <GO>}

Okay. Appreciate the color. Thanks.

A - Unidentified Speaker
So Mike, we're off the time now.

A - Michael Andrew Wells

{BIO 4211236 <GO>}

Yes. We then go to Patrick.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Unidentified Speaker
Hi, everybody. Well, I want to tell everyone thank you for your time. And I hope everyone is
safe and functioning well the best they can in this current situation. I know it's changed a
lot of work styles. I hope what you hear in this and the reason we wanted to continue to
give you updates on how the business was doing is the business is shifting. I think it's
showing its agility. I mean, some of our investment in the tech now is clear, you could -you can't talk about Pulse is digital and online without having the ability to digitally process
and handled digital currencies. And the scalability now of our platforms and our
capabilities, I think are very unique in our history. And you're seeing that play out in a very
stressed environment.
We've referenced a couple times earlier on the call, regardless of the shape of the
recovery of this pandemic we think some of these consumer behaviors stay, some of the
scalability, some of its convenience, some of its major clients. But the idea that all of our
sales, if you think of it, one of our agents said the other day that he's gone from business
at home, business in an office to business in a Starbucks and now business on a
interactive screen on Azure or Microsoft teams. Those are consumer preference changes
as much as they are sort of prerequisites for us to be able to stay with that and have the
capability to execute however that client wants to do business with us.
So both things are all happening at pace. The earnings, as we've said, it is important to
shift to health and protection and it is important to shift the recurring earnings. You see
those recurring earnings and retention rates in the high 90s on the retention rate and the
earnings falling from that. So strategically I think we're very well positioned to deal with
whatever shape this comes. The state and the size of this cohort are profitable new sales
in client relationships is hard to determine, because that's dependent on the next two
quarters or however long normality takes and whatever shape it comes in.
Page 19 of 20

FINAL

But that doesn't affect the overall profitability of the business, as much as we've shown in
the various presentations over the last few years. It defined one increment, we know one
vintage if you will. So consumer behavior is not changing, policy holder behavior in U.S.,
Asia, again, is sort of as expected. And so there is a lot of disruption, but there is a lot of
what we built for playing out here and working as we expected.
So I just want to thank everybody for their time. We're going to keep giving you updates
on things that we think are material, some requiring I know some more informal just so
you can get a scale of -- you get some feedback on how informally and formally on how
some of the things we're doing are shaping. And we'll just keep those coming as the -- as
we think information needs to be in the market.
