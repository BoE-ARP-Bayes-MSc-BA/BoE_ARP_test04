Derek Bulas
Good morning and welcome to our call to discuss Fairfax's 2019 third quarter results. This
call may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ perhaps materially
from those contained in such forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of
uncertainties and risk factors, the most foreseeable of which are set out under Risk

regulators and is available on SEDAR.
I'll now turn the call over to our President, Paul Rivett.

FINAL

Fairfax's net earnings for the third quarter were $69 million versus $106 million in the third
quarter of 2018, which translates to net earnings per share of $2.04 versus $3.34 in 2018.
For the nine months of 2019, our net earnings were $1.33 billion versus $854 million for the
first nine months 2018. Fairfax's book value per share increased to $462.98 at September
30 2019, compared to $432.46 at December 31 2018, an increase of 9.5% adjusted for
the $10 dividend in the first quarter.
Our operating companies generated another good quarter with an aggregate combined
ratio below 100% with a combined ratio of 97.5% and strong reserves across the group,
while producing an underwriting profit of $81 million in the third quarter. All of our major
insurance companies with the exception of Brit generated combined ratios less than
100% with Zenith at 87.1%, Odyssey Group at 97.6%, Northbridge at 97.5%, Crum & Forster
at 97.9% and Allied World at 96.2%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Brit generally recognized higher losses relative to net premiums earned in the third
quarter, and we expect this to reverse in the fourth quarter with Brit being closer to its
plan of 97% for the year, excluding any major catastrophes. Allied World deserves a call
out for the 96.2% combined ratio in the quarter. Lou and team are hitting stride. I should
also mention that Scott Carmilani in his new role as President of Distribution and Strategic
Operations of Fairfax is continuing to make good progress, growing new business with
our companies and building out our data and Fairfax Worldwide platforms.
For the third quarter, Fairfax's operating income was strong at $280 million versus $250
million in the third quarter of 2018, reflecting primarily higher interest and dividends. Net
losses on investments for the third quarter were $97 million, consisting of realized gains of
$48 million and unrealized losses of $145 million principally from BlackBerry. The realized
gains included a gain of $150 million on the sale of 5% of the company's 9.9% equity
interest and ICICI Lombard.
In the fourth quarter, we sold our remaining interest in ICICI Lombard. Total cash proceeds
from the third and fourth quarter sales of ICICI Lombard were $729 million. In total, we
invested $347 million to establish ICICI Lombard and we raised $1.64 billion from the sale
of ICICI Lombard, a return of $1.3 billion. We continue to be very good friends with the
teams at ICICI Lombard and ICICI Bank and we wish them well in the future.
We have shifted our focus to Digit, our new digital insurance company in India, under the
leadership of Kamesh Goyal, which was just awarded the prestigious General Insurer of
the Year Award in Asia, after only 2 years of operation.
Now for some key highlights for the third quarter to bring to your attention. First, our
companies are continuing to see firming pricing across most lines of business in North
America, with the exception of workers' compensation. This was demonstrated again in
the third quarter as our insurance and reinsurance businesses net written premium
increased year-over-year by 13.7%. Principal areas of growth were at Northbridge,
Odyssey Group, Crum & Forster and Allied World. By company, the change in net
premiums written for the third quarter were as follows: Odyssey Group up 21%; Allied
World up 18%; Northbridge up 18%; Crum & Forster up 16%; Zenith down 9%; and Brit

down 3%. As we have said on prior calls, (inaudible) the team at Zenith continue taking the
long-term view and are prudently letting go of workers compensation business that is
inadequately priced. With Brit, they are seeing price increases but have reduced net
premiums written in some low-margin business and have purchased increased
reinsurance protection. In total, gross premiums written across the group is up 12% in the
quarter versus last year and the first nine months are up 13% versus last year.
Growth in total investments or float has followed suit and is now at $41.5 billion versus
approximately $39 billion at the beginning of the year. We have approximately $10 billion
invested in short-term U.S. treasuries and short-term investment-grade corporate bonds.
Given the continued strength of the U.S. economy, we feel it is prudent to remain
positioned on the shorter end of the treasury curve for the time being. We continue to be
focused on growing interest and dividend income, which was $215 million in this third
quarter versus a $194 million in the third quarter of 2018.
Hamblin Watsa is vigilantly observing and monitoring global events and economic
indicators. We remain skeptical that the U.S. economy is heading for a recession just yet.
On the contrary, we believe the U.S. economy is growing. The U.S. job market continues to
be firm. Financial conditions remain relatively loose. The U.S. consumer is indebted less
today than a decade ago, and the U.S. savings rate is higher today than at any time in the
last 10 years. Despite all this, the Fed has cut rates again this week. Recent global
developments have led to some positive upward momentum in rates. The Phase 1 trade
deal between the U.S. and China, followed by a potential Brexit deal between the U.K.
and EU, have removed some fear for now and volatility ifrom the markets. All this said, if
we are wrong and a U.S. recession is drawing near, we would expect to have plenty of
opportunities to take advantage of given our large cash and short duration sovereign
holdings at approximately 45% of the portfolio.
I will now pass the call over to Jennifer Allen, our new Chief Financial Officer, for additional
financial and accounting details. But before I do, let me give you some background on
Jen. We have the good fortune at Fairfax of having a number of talented, young
executives in our organization that allow us to recruit internally. Jennifer Allen epitomizes
that group. While at Fairfax over the last 13 years, Jen has worked in various roles on
numerous projects with three of our former CFOs. Jen has previously excelled as our
Assistant Vice President Finance and Global Controller, the CFO of Fairfax India and the
CFO of Fairfax Africa. During her tenure as the Chief Financial Officer at Fairfax India and
Africa, Jen played key roles in many initiatives for these publicly listed companies,
including capital raising, mergers and acquisitions, negotiating credit facilities, liaising with
regulators and of course, overseeing the accounting team. Amy Sherk has now moved
into the CFO role at Fairfax India and Fairfax Africa. We are very thankful to have such a
talented, experienced and humble executive as Jennifer Allen to takeover Fairfax's Chief
Financial Officer role and we have every expectation that she will do a tremendous job for
our company and our shareholders.
Okay. Over to you, Jen, for the first conference call.

Thank you, Paul. Before I discuss Fairfax's third quarter results, I would like to take the
opportunity to first thank you, Paul, for your kind words and support over these past few
months, and to acknowledge and say thank you to the management team at Fairfax, all of
our operating subsidiaries globally and a special thanks to the dedicated and talented
people that I work with daily at Fairfax. Their hard work and dedication is unparalleled. I am
so fortunate to have been provided the support throughout this transition, so thank you to
everyone. Now turning to Fairfax's results for the quarter. In the third quarter of 2019,
Fairfax reported net earnings of $69 million or $2.04 per share on a fully diluted basis.
That compared to the third quarter of 2018 when we reported net earnings of $106
million or $3.34 per share on a fully diluted basis. For the first 9 months of 2019 Fairfax
reported net earnings of $1.3 billion or $46.23 per share on a fully diluted basis, compared
to the first 9 months of 2018 when we reported net earnings of $854 million or $28.83 per
share on a fully diluted basis.

Underwriting profit at our insurance and reinsurance operations in the third quarter of
2019 increased to $81 million with a combined ratio of 97.5 compared to underwriting
profit of $74 million and a combined ratio of 96.7 in the third quarter of 2018. Underwriting
profit in the first 9 months of 2019 decreased to $271 million with a combined ratio of 97.1
compared to underwriting profit of $299 million with a combined ratio of 96.6 in the first 9
months of 2018.
Our combined ratios benefited from favorable prior year reserve development in the
third quarter and first 9 months of 2019 of $94 million and $185 million that translated into
2.9 and 2.0 combined ratio points in each of those periods compared to net favorable
prior year reserve development of $174 million and $372 million that represented 5.7 and
4.2 combined ratio points in both those respective periods in 2018.
Looking to our operating company results starting with Northbridge, Northbridge's
underwriting profit was $8 million in the third quarter and $12 million in the first 9 months of
2019 and had combined ratios of 97.5 and 98.7 in each of those respective periods. That
compared to underwriting profit of $1 million and $16 million and combined ratios of 89.5
and 98.1 in each of those same periods in 2018.
Northbridge's underwriting results in the first 9 months of 2019 included net favorable
prior year reserve development of $32 million representing 3.5 combined ratio points,
reflecting better-than-expected loss emergence across all major business lines. This
compared to net favorable prior year reserve development of $37 million and $72 million,
representing 12.7 and 8.6 combined ratio points in the third quarter and first 9 months of
2018 reflecting better-than-expected loss emergence on automobile and casualty
business line.
The underwriting results in the first 9 months of 2019 included $10 million of current period
CAT losses compared to $17 million of current period catastrophe losses in the first 9
months of 2018, both periods related primarily to storms in Ontario and Quebec. In
Canadian dollar terms, net premiums written by Northbridge in the third quarter and first
9 months of '19 increased by 19.1% and 16.9% in each of those respective periods,
reflecting strong retention of renewal business, growth in new business and price
increases across the group.

2019. Compared to underwriting profit of $19 million and $134 million on combined ratios
of 97.5 and 93.5 in the third quarter and first 9 months of 2018.
Current period catastrophe losses of $67 million and $135 million represented 7.9 and 5.7
combined ratio points in the third quarter and first 9 months of 2019. Those principally
related to Hurricane Dorian and typhoon mangkhut smaller losses on various
catastrophes. We're lower than the current period catastrophe losses of $77 million and
$142 million that represented 10.4 and 6.9 combined ratio points in the third quarter and
first 9 months of 2018 that principally related to Typhoon Jebi, Hurricane Florence,
Typhoon mangkhut and smaller losses on various catastrophes.
RC Group's combined ratios in the third quarter and first 9 months of 2019 also benefited
from net favorable prior year reserve development of $46 million and $86 million, which
represented 5.6 and 3.6 combined ratio points respectively. That compared to net
favorable prior year reserve development of $66 million and $152 million which equated to
8.9 and 7.4 combined ratio points, respectively, in the third quarter and first 9 months of
2018.

Bloomberg Transcript

The net favorable prior year reserve development of both years principally related to
catastrophe and property catastrophe loss reserves. Odyssey Group drove $855 million
and $2.5 billion of net premiums in the third quarter and first 9 months of 2019 that
represent increases of 21.2% in the third quarter of 19 and 14.9% in the first 9 months of
2019.
The increase principally reflected higher net premiums written within their US Insurance,
North America and the London market divisions. Moving on to Crum & Forster, Crum &
Forster's underwriting profit improved to $12 million and $36 million in the third quarter
and first 9 months of 2019 with combined ratios of 97.9 and 97.7 in both those respective
periods.
That compared to underwriting profit of $10 million and $18 million with combined ratios of
98.1 and 98.8 in the third quarter and first 9 months of 2018. Attritional current period
catastrophe losses were $5 million and $13 million in the third quarter and first 9 months of
'19 about 1.1 combined ratio point in each of those respective periods.
That was in line with the 2018 third quarter current period catastrophe losses of $5 million
and slightly lower than the $17 million of current period catastrophe losses in the first 9
months of 2018. Crum & Forster's net premiums written increased by 16.4% in the third
quarter and 15.1% in the first 9 months of 2019 primarily reflecting business volume growth
in surplus and specialty, accident and health and surety and program lines of business.
Looking to Zenith National, Zenith National reported underwriting profit in the third quarter
and first 9 months of 2019 of $24 million and $92 million with combined ratios of 87.1 and
83.3 which compared to underwriting profits of $41 million and $91 million with combined
ratios of 80.3 and 84.9 each of those respective periods in 2018.

FINAL

The underwriting profit in the third quarter and first 9 months of 2019 included $17 million
and $75 million or 8.9 and 13.7 combined ratio points of net favorable prior year reserve
development, which compared to $23 million and $59 million or 11 and 9.9 combined ratio
points in the third quarter and first 9 months of 2018.
The net favorable prior year reserve development of both years principally reflected net
favorable emergence related to accident years 2013 through 2018. Zenith wrote a $152
million and $580 million of net premiums in the third quarter and first 9 months of 2019
which was lower than the $167 million and the $638 million of net premiums in those
respective periods in 2018. The decrease in net premiums written in 19 primarily reflected
price decreases.
Looking to Brit, Brit in the third quarter and first 9 months of 2019. Brit reported
underwriting loss of $16 million and an underwriting profit of $13 million and combined
ratios of 104.1 and 98.9 compared to underwriting losses of $33 million and $50 million
with combined ratios of 108.3 and 101.3 in each of those same periods in 2018.

Bloomberg Transcript

Current period catastrophe losses of $40 million and $43 million that represented 10.3
and 3.6 combined ratio points in the third quarter and first 9 months of 2019 principally
related to Hurricane Dorian and Typhoon which were lower than current period
catastrophe losses of $66 million and $70 million that represented 16.8 and 6.0 combined
ratio points in the third quarter and first 9 months of 2018 that related to Typhoon Jebi,
Hurricane Florence and Typhoon Mangkhut.
Net favorable prior year reserve development was lower in the third quarter and first 9
months of 2019 at $8 million and $10 million or 2.1 and 0.8 combined ratio points. Principally
reflecting better-than-expected claims experience in various lines of business that
compared to $19 million in $28 million or 4.8 and 2.4 combined ratio points in the third
quarter and first 9 months of 2018, principally reflecting better-than-expected emergence
in the 2017 catastrophe losses in the 3rd quarter and on energy, and US property business
line in the first nine months. Brit's net premiums written decreased by 2.5% and increased
by 1.6% in third quarter and first nine months of 2019, respectively. The decrease in the
third quarter primarily reflected increased use of proportional treaty reinsurance and the
purchase of increased catastrophe protection. The increase in the first nine months
primarily reflected growth in their core book of business, generated by increased
contribution from initiatives launched in recent years and price increases. That was partially
offset by reductions in non-core lines of business and increased use of proportional treaty
reinsurance, and the purchase of increased catastrophe protection.
Moving onto Allied World. Allied World reported underwriting profit of $23 million in both
the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 with combined ratios of 96.2, 98.7 in each
of the respective periods. This compared to an underwriting profit of $20 million and $75
million, with combined ratios of 96.7 and 95.5 in the same periods in 2018. Current period
catastrophe losses of 2$3 million in both the third quarter and nine months of '19
represented 3.9 and 1.3 combined ratio points, also principally related to Hurricane Dorian
and Typhoon Faxi, which compared to higher catastrophe losses of $62 million that
represented 10.3 and 3.7 combined ratio points in the third quarter and first nine months

of 2018. That also related to Typhoon Jebi, and Hurricane Florence and Typhoon
Mangkuht.
Allied World's underwriting profit in the first nine months of 2019 was impacted by $79
million or 4.4 combined ratio points of net adverse prior year reserve development,
reflecting deterioration in the insurance segment of $47 million, principally related to North
American Casualty, and the reinsurance segment for $3 million that related to Typhoon
Jebi. In the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, Allied World benefited from $13
million or 2.2 combined ratio points and $28 million or 1.7 combined ratio points, reflecting
favorable emergence on the 2017 catastrophe losses. Allied World contributed $613
million or $2 billion in net premiums written in the third quarter and first 9 months of 2019,
representing year-over-year increases of 18.2 and 6.1 respectively, relating to high renewal
rates and new business growth across the entire organization.

Moving to Fairfax Asia. Fairfax Asia recorded underwriting profit of $2 million and $3 million
with combined ratios of 96.9 and 97.8 in the third quarter and first nine months of 2019.
This was better than the underwriting profit of $1 million and an underwriting loss of $1
million with the combined ratios of 98.5 and 100.9 in those same periods in 2018.
Combined ratios in the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 included $8 million and
$21 million or 14.6 and 14.4 combined ratio points of net favorable prior year reserve
development, which compared to $6 million and 1#6 million or 12 points and 11.4 combined
ratio points in each of the respective periods, our net favorable prior year reserve
development in the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, the net favorable prior
year reserve development of both years principally related to automobile, property and
workers' compensation.
Moving on to Insurance and Reinsurance Other segment, they produced underwriting
profits of $8 million and $4 million with combined ratios of 97.1 and 99.5 in the third quarter
and first nine months of 2019. That compared to underwriting losses of $13 million and 19
million with combined ratios of 104.7 and 102.2 in those same periods in 2018.
And finally, looking to run-off. Run-off reported operating losses of $14 million and $45
million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2019 compared to operating losses of
$49 million and $102 million in those same periods in 2018. The improvement in the
underwriting loss year-over-year principally reflected improvement in the underwriting
results and higher investment income.
And now, looking at the consolidated results of Fairfax. The consolidated interest and
dividend income increased year-over-year from $194 million and $583 million in the third
quarter and first nine months of 2018, $215 million and $672 million in the third quarter and
first nine months of 2019, primarily reflecting higher interest income earned on our
increased holdings of high quality corporate bonds, short-dated U.S. Treasury bonds and
Canadian government bonds. That was partially offset by the lower interest income
earned on a decrease holdings of our U.S. municipal bonds.
Fairfax recorded a recovery of income taxes of $5 million in the quarter that represented
a 6.4 effective income tax rate and a provision for income taxes of $325 million at an 8.1%

effective income tax rate in the first nine months of 2019, principally reflecting the impact
of non-taxable investment income and the tax differential in income and losses outside of
Canada.
Our total debt to total cap ratio, excluding the non-insurance operations, increased to 27.1
at September 30 2019 from 25.0 at December 31, 2018, primarily as a result of the
increased holding company debt that was partially offset by our increase in common
shareholders' equity.
We ended the third quarter of 2019 with an investment portfolio, which included the
holding company cash and investments of $41.5 billion that compared to the $38.8 billion
investment portfolio at December 31, 2018.
And now I'll pass it back over to you, Paul.

Questions And Answers

Bloomberg Transcript

Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)
Our first question came from the line of Paul Holden of CIBC. Your line is now open.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning.

A - Paul C. Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Good morning, Paul.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

So I have two questions for you. First one is on the investment portfolio. So I know that the
Q4 '18 call you mentioned striving for better investment performance in 2019, and
certainly to some extent you've achieved that. More specifically you referred to
monetizations and process. I was wondering if we can kind of get status update on that
monetizations and process and just a characterization of how far you think you're along in
that process. Is there still a lot to potentially do there?

A - Paul C. Rivett

FINAL

Company N ame: Fairfax Financial H oldings L td
Company Ticker: FFH CN Equity
Date: 2019-11-01

Yes. No, good question, Paul. So we are -- we're quite far along in the process there.
We've got the whole Hamblin Watsa team from Prem right through working with us. A
number of these things are close to fruition. A few that are more at the earlier stages, but
as you can imagine, we can't give you specifics on it, but we're very happy that we're
close to being able to get a few things across the line in the fourth quarter. ICICI Lombard
was part of that. So you saw that we can act fairly quickly. But also it's a -- we want to get
best price and best execution, right? So we're working to get working to do that for our
shareholders. And as you said, we have done fairly well this year. We're on target for that
50% ROE. And that's a result of hitting that 6% return target in the portfolio. And we're
excited because we've got a bigger float now that keeps coming in, thanks to our
operating company. So that gives us a little bit more leverage as we go into the end of
the year, but we're quite close on a few of the things we've been working on and we look
forward to announcing them when they come across the line.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Great. Second question is on the underwriting performance, specifically premium growth.
Wondering if you can give us a sense of how much of that is coming from volume versus
price. And I guess what I'm really trying to get to here is sustainability of sort of -- let's call
it a low teen type growth rate.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Paul C. Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Yes. So it's always hard to tell because you don't want to get too excited, but I have to tell
you that in my career here, 16 years, we're starting to get quite excited. I haven't seen
anything quite like this. It's firming. No one's calling it a hard market yet; no one's ringing
the bell but its firming. And I would say and I'd look to Jen but we're roughly of that 13%,
were roughly 50% premium 50% price. So it's a good mix and we're quite excited than
that don't want to predict where it can go from here but we think that might have links.
Jen, I don't know if you want to add anything to that.

A - Jennif er Allen

{BIO 20542595 <GO>}

No, I think that's a fair statement.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Great, thank you for your answers.

Operator
Thank you. The next question from the line of Jeff Fenwick of Cormark Securities. Your line
is now open.

Q - Jeff Fenwick

{BIO 15350794 <GO>}

Hi, there. Good morning, everyone. So, Paul, I just wanted to follow up on the question
around the positioning of the investment portfolio, and I guess one point of push back. I
often get from investors is the, Fairfax isn't afraid to take some bigger swing to stocks
and have some larger positions like a BlackBerry and like the Telco in there. It can create
Page 9 of 18



Company N ame: Fairfax Financial H oldings L td
Company Ticker: FFH CN Equity
Date: 2019-11-01

some quarter-by-quarter volatility. So is this can when we talk about that, monetization or
reorientation within the portfolio. Is that something that you're thinking about like how do
you incorporate that type of approach that might help to maybe reduce some of the
volatility or sort of improve the performance, were you going through time?

FINAL

A - Paul C. Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Yeah, Listen, I think we have heard that we've heard that from our shareholders and, but
for us and we're always going to be value focus and then there may be larger positions
from time to time. And generally speaking, we don't want to go any bigger than the
current position sizing that we have but we continue to be focused on the names we have
and we will always be value investors and there may from time to time be larger positions
as value investors but keeping in mind that even now with the $41.5 billion in float even a
$1 billion position is relatively small in the portfolio. So, but we are mindful of that and
going forward, we don't want to have positions much bigger than $1 billion in any way.

A - Jennif er Allen

{BIO 20542595 <GO>}

Then maybe if you could talk a little bit of as capital and balance sheet position here
you're seeing units like Odyssey and Allied growing so much. How are you feeling from a
balance sheet leverage perspective, and are you confident that you're are well positioned
to go out and capture that opportunity.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Paul C. Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Yeah, we're really excited and confident where we are on, from a capital perspective, you
know this, but we always have been keeping and well for the foreseeable future keep
more than $1 billion at the holding company level. And we don't get rating agency credit
for that. But we keep it there, just to make sure that we're there for our subs in the future
and for policyholders and shareholders. But we're very well capitalized. And as we've said
on prior calls as we started to see this trend progressing. We are there for our operating
companies to grow, because there is an opportunity for a little bit maybe of a step
change as far as getting that business and growing the float and being able to stay at that
higher level and meanwhile, we're out there doing things like refinancing our debt, you
saw that we did a recently a Canadian deal we've pushed out maturities until 2022 of any
consequence. And we're continuing to look at ways to find chief financing alternatives. Not
much, really we can do now between now in 2022. But we are looking for alternative
sources of financing. And to sum it up, we are very, very comfortable and very excited
about where we are from a capital position there for our operating.

Q - Jeff Fenwick

{BIO 15350794 <GO>}

And I guess just to follow on with that is around prioritization. Clearly, you want to support
the growth of the operating units there, but what about buybacks, I mean at the stock
continue sort of -- here and the discount to the group just seems to be probably the
highest I've seen it over the last 10 years or so, how does that factor into the next year for
you?

We do watch it and as (inaudible) has said over the last 34 years. I mean there's a multiple
goes up and goes down and certainly at a discount we see that, but in the third quarter,
although we did both $30 million in buyback for treasury purposes, third quarter we want
to make sure that we're watching that's the high CAT quarter. So we want to be extra
careful there but it is, let's say, a priority for us. But first, as I mentioned in the prior
question, we want to be there for our companies to make sure they grow and grab that
great business while they can increase our float and we have already said, we're going to
be looking to take our partners out in Brit and Eurolife in the coming months. But we're
mindful on the stock and at there at the right time we'll obviously take advantage to the
extent we can.

The next question is from the line of Jaeme Gloyn of National Bank Financial. Your line is
now open.

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning. First question just related to the shift of Allied World to
Bermuda based company is there, what are some of the impacts of that change?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Paul C. Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

No real impact.

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

Like from a tax point of view, we're financially that was --

A - Paul C. Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

No, not at all.

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

Okay. And then one of the things going on in US insurance and dig in the buzzword from
other calls is social inflation. Can you provide us with any comments on the impacts to
Fairfax's underlying business units as relates to that theme?

A - Paul C. Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Yeah, so I mean the big impact is obviously if we think it's part of this increasing firming of
pricing and including the fact that there's also capacity seems to be coming out in lower
limits. But we believe we've been proactive on this trend in our underwriting actions,
we've seen higher losses in commercial auto, for example, but we believe we're ahead of
that curve on this trend with our companies and their underwriting actions and the
company as a whole benefits because we have a diversified mix of business both by line
Page 11 of 18



Company N ame: Fairfax Financial H oldings L td

of business and geography. And generally of lower smaller business that we write with
lower limit. So for us, social inflation is as we see it is just part of what's giving this firming
pricing and should be all things considered, a good thing for us going forward.

FINAL

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

Great. And last one real quick, just with the growth in premiums. Is there a targeted
leverage either from a underwriting leverage or where investment leverage that you're
looking to achieve with the outsized growth in premiums at this stage?

A - Paul C. Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

No, real target, sky is the limit. I'd say that a little flippantly. But the reality is in our
decentralized structure each of our CEOs is incentivized for 95 combined and they are as
you see their growing profitably with great reserving. So but no target.

Thank you. The next question is from the line of Tom MacKinnon of BMO Capital. Your line
is now open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Yeah, thanks very much. Just a question on your comments you said if there was a US
recession you'd see opportunities, maybe you can elaborate as to what those
opportunities are? I assume that would be deployment of the cash. But I don't assume it's
buying anymore in terms of equities; given you're kind of at year at your limit there being
totally being that these things including your investments in associates and whatnot or
equivalent to your book value. So would these opportunities, really just be deploying the
cash into more fixed income.

A - Paul C. Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

So, good question Tom. So we as we've done in the past you saw in the financial crisis, we
were able to be there to provide convertibles to folks who just couldn't get financing
anywhere else. So that convertible going to convertibles would be part of the change of
mix being in very liquid short-term sovereign cash and sovereign debt, we can very quickly
switch and deploy in areas like convertibles also take advantage of the extent that
spreads -- take advantage generally. So that's, that's one area. But the other is I
mentioned with one of the prior questions, we are changing the mix on equities as we're
executing on some of the disposition strategy. So there is, there will be ready to the
extent that it changes, will be ready either way, so that's what we're positioning ourselves.
We have not despite pressure and we see it from our competitors, we're not reaching for
yield, staying patient, preserving capital and we'll see which way it goes, we are leaning a
little bit as I said towards thinking that the US is strong and we'll get a trade deal done
Phase 1 shortly and we'll continue to follow that trend. Job numbers were good this

morning and we see a little bit of potentially wage inflation from that GM deal. So, we
think it might trend that way, but either way it goes, we're ready to go with the portfolio
as it's currently structured.

FINAL

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay. And just a follow-up with respect to your comments about the buyback. Now that
we're kind of almost through the Cat season, given where your stock trades, what is your
thinking in terms of buyback now?

A - Paul C. Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

We're definitely watching it. I don't want to give away our hand, but priority is making sure
we're there as growth's accelerating. We're also obviously monitoring some of the Cats
that have happened in this quarter, too. As you said, it's generally seems to be over, but
we're seeing things like California wildfire, which so far hasn't been as serious as Camp
Fire was last year. But, we are watching the stock, rest assured, but we want to be there
for what could be a generational shift in pricing and we'll balance the approach, but
definitely and always will be interested in our stock at the right price.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

Thank you. And the next question is from the line of Junior Roth [ph], private investor. Your
line is now open.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Good morning. Toys R US, can you give us an update on how that's performing, if it's
performing as expected when you purchased it? And then, the other question is, what do
you think about value investing, because in the last 5 to 10 years value investing hasn't
really performed. Do you think that's going to change going forward or what's your
perspective on that?

A - Paul C. Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Junior, you never can tell with these things, but with Prem and the team with decades of
experience, these things have a way of turning. We might have seen that, with what we've
seen with WeWork and a movement among the growth group to focus a bit more on
bottom line, free cash flow and earnings. So, we may be seeing a shift back to value, but
listen, one way or the other that doesn't matter. We are focused on capital preservation
and the value approach and we're going to stick with that. We think over the long run, it
has worked and it will continue to work.
On Toys R Us, retail environment has been tough in Canada. You saw the news last night,
this morning, about in Canada and particularly out west, loss of jobs. So retail is off. Toys R
Us continues to be producing good EBITDA, it's a critical season right now, but the

downside protection, as you think about it from a value perspective, is that we bought it
for the real estate value and the business is all upside. We're very supportive there and
we will continue to be very supportive of the business, continue to believe in it. But it's
upside, and it continues to perform not in expectations, but over the long term, we
expect that it will be a great cash generator for us.

Hi, good morning. A few of my questions have already been covered. But, a numbers
question. On the ICICI Lombard sale, saw you commented in the interim report in terms
of some of that was sold in the third quarter and some of it was in the fourth quarter.
Where does the cash from that show up? Or maybe cash hasn't been received yet.

A - Paul C. Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

So Jen, maybe you want to take that one.

A - Jennif er Allen

{BIO 20542595 <GO>}

So, on the ICICI Lombard sales, it's up in the holding company cash subsequent to the
quarter, 250 of that proceeds that came in was used to repay at the credit facility. And we
are working on the residual to be paid off in the next coming weeks. But that is up in the
holding company cash line.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Okay, thank you. The second question, I was going to ask about it anyway, but you kind of
mentioned it in your opening remarks about digits. Am I correct, that's not a consolidated
entity, that's whatever you call, affiliate holding or affiliate investment?

A - Jennif er Allen

{BIO 20542595 <GO>}

Yes. That's correct. It's investment in associates. So, it's equity accounted.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Okay. And, any of the proportional proceeds of that are going to come through within that
corresponding P&L line, is that all right?

Thank you. And the next question is from the line of Luis Hernandez [ph], Private investor.
Your line is now open.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Yes, hello, good morning and thanks for taking the question. My question is basically on
India. Given the fact that both Fairfax itself, as you know, is a few direct investments that
are pretty big and where the company has a big stake in, and then obviously there is also
the Fairfax India vehicle. So, I just wanted to see your comments on how are you seeing
the market? What are the opportunities that you're looking at? I mean as a general
comment, given what I just said.

A - Paul C. Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Thank you for the question. So, we continue to be very excited about India, under Prime
Minister Modi. It's a little bit down now, the market. Emerging markets generally are a little
down, but that's an opportunity for us. We think long-term future of that country and that
economy is one of the best places to invest on the planet. And so, we continue to be very
excited about opportunities, continue to be analyzing opportunities. Our investments
there, we think are very good and we'll continue to grow, given it's just such a dynamic
country and with what the Prime Minister Modi is doing and being business friendly. We
continue to be very excited about that market.

The next question is from (inaudible). Your line is now open.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Hi, there. I thought I might just sneak in one on India as well. And I'm not sure if you're in a
position to comment, Paul. I mean maybe Jennifer can. One of the most notable aspects
of their quarter that they reported last night was the big uptick in value at the Bangalore
Airport, at the IAL. Looks like maybe plans for terminal being put in there. Can you offer
any comment about that? Just the extent of the swing there was pretty meaningful in
percentage terms, and any color you can offer on how some of the assumptions changed
in the model there to trigger that increase.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jennif er Allen

{BIO 20542595 <GO>}

Sure, no problem. If we look at the Bangalore Airport that's held through Fairfax India, they
recently had the master plan approved by the underlying regulation authorities in India,
that allow them to bring on that third terminal. So, that's most of the lift that you're seeing
in the third quarter. We didn't have it in the prior quarters, because it is quite a robust
process they have to go through to make sure they have that regulatory approval and
before we can actually factor that into the cash flows. So, that is most of the list that you
see in the third quarter. Maybe to note also on that asset is, we've disclosed extensively in
the past that the underlying real estate asset, we're still waiting on the master plan on
that one, that value is not yet in. The underlying value of Bangalore Airport it's only at a
least value. So, that is something, hopefully in the coming quarters, we'll start to see
hopefully benefit lift on that as well, which we have disclosed previously.

And our final question is from the line of Andrew Hollingworth, of Holland Advisors. Your
line is open.

Q - Andrew Hollingworth

{BIO 1896571 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. Can I just get back to one of the original questions that you had, just
regarding the redeployment of the equity portfolio? I mean you made the point pull that
billion dollar position is about as big as you roll and it's not a very big percentage of the
$41 billion. But it is quite a big percentage of the equity portfolio of the business. So, I think
maybe the message that investors want to hear is that, going forward, the equity
portfolio will be just more diversified than it is today. And probably a bit more liquid than it
is today, because I'm not going to say which Holdings you should and shouldn't own,

Page 16 of 18



Company N ame: Fairfax Financial H oldings L td
Company Ticker: FFH CN Equity
Date: 2019-11-01

that's not for us to do, but obviously trying to liquidate a 33 position in Eurobank would be
very difficult thing to do. Is that the move of the company, to try and end up with a value
orientated portfolio that's still sticks with the mentality of the organization, one that's a
little bit more suited to the task of being the core equity of this whole organization?

FINAL

A - Paul C. Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

No, I think, Andrew, that's a fair comment. And I think it's a correct comment. We do want
to be in overtime and more liquid position, but always with the value. But continuing to be
opportunistic. I think you're right, our preference would be to be liquid, but we do and
take the opportunities as they come, and as I said, we will want to stay below the $1 billion.
Even that is only for really good opportunities like we've seen with Seaspan, it's done
some remarkably well. And we think there is upside still on that. But, we're mindful of that
limit and we will continue to be focused on it, would be opportunistic and always with a
value focus.

Q - Andrew Hollingworth

{BIO 1896571 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Can I just ask one separate follow-up? And just in terms of the comments you made
earlier on about a slightly stronger market, in terms of premium pricing and all the rest of
it. I'm intrigued here, why do you think this is taking place? It doesn't feel like it's got less
capital in it and also maybe with the history, the group has got, looking back at previous
situations where you've seen the firmer market. Is there ever a reason why it takes place,
or do you just look back in 5 years and say, I know we can solve it in hindsight, but at the
time we never knew really?

A - Paul C. Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Andrew, it's the question right now in our industry. I think, in hindsight everybody can piece
it together. But it's a number of factors. It's the low interest rate environment. It's the
social inflation that we talked about, it's the capacity coming out from some of our
competitors, including capacity coming out in the Lloyd's market, it's catastrophes like
what happened in 2017, worst catastrophe year on record, that have really shaken up the
core and got a whole generation of underwriters, focused on needing to get price again,
as opposed to the opposite. So, it's a whole list of factors, all coming together. And I
don't think anybody necessarily saw it coming. But it certainly seems like it's on its way
now.

Q - Andrew Hollingworth

{BIO 1896571 <GO>}

That was my last. Thank you for taking my question.
