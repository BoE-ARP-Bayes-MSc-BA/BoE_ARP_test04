Presentation
Operator
Welcome to MAPFRE's update conference call. We are pleased to introduce Mr. Esteban
Tejera, First Vice Chairman of the Group, who will conduct the presentation. Please go
ahead sir.

Esteban Tejera

{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. And thank you for attending this
conference call, even if we have advised you very early this morning. But the occasion is
what it is.
We have acquired the Direct Line's, as you know now, operations in Germany and Italy of
Direct Line. And I would like to share with you the main rationale of this operation.
If we go to page four of the presentation, here the price that is public now, EUR550
million. I would like to remark that this, we think, is a positive conclusion to the Group's
result from the beginning.
On page five we have the key highlights of the transaction. I would like develop later that
this transaction is in clear alignment with the market strategy.

We are acquiring two companies that -- we think that are successful, profitable and
consolidating businesses; is a complementary fit and an opportunity for maximizing our
capacity as a Group in developing our business model. And I will be more in depth in this
special highlight.

FINAL

These are transactions that we think that incorporates growth potential and value creation
for the Group.
On page six we analyze the alignment with the MAPFRE strategy. The transaction is a
significant step forward in the strategy announced by our Chairman during the last AGM.
It matches perfectly with our strategy of international diversification; especially he
mentioned growth in Europe. In this aspect it's an increase of our presence in the Euro
area as well as [ph] Spain. And in the branches where we are a specialist, like motor
insurance.

Bloomberg Transcript

It matches also with our approach of the multi-channel development of the direct
insurance business. As is developed in the annex of this presentation, the average
composite growth in Italy and Germany in the last five years was respectively, in this
segment of market, of 14.6% and 9.1% respectively.
It will allow us to utilize our in-house digital platform for online direct insurance in new
markets. This is very important, because we were working very hard during the last years
in developing this platform in our subsidiary in Spain, VERTI. And in several projects that
we were running in other countries where we have presence.
On page seven you can see how these acquisitions have changed, due to the fact that
this represent a (inaudible) in our project of development of this activity in Direct Line in
Europe. We are acquiring successful companies, that are profitable from the scratch and
they are consolidated businesses.
Direct Line operates in this market since 2002; is the leader in the direct insurance market
in Italy and ranks third in Germany, with market shares of 28% and 13% respectively in the
motor direct insurance.
We incorporate with this operation more than 1 million in-force policies in Italy and close to
600,000 in Germany.
And is, as I mentioned, a consistently profitable business since 2009. They have very
significant average growth rates between 2009 and 2013, outperforming their markets.
I mentioned the percentage of growth before for the market as a whole. And these
companies in Italy -- this company in Italy has an average compound growth ratio of 16%
of the premiums and 88% in profits; and in Germany 9% in premiums and 20% in profits,
according to the market.

And even if they specialize in this, Direct Line segment, they have also important
distribution agreements with major brand car dealerships, supermarkets, web portals and
other partners that allow -- complement the business of the direct insurance distribution.

FINAL

As I mentioned, I develop it in -- on page 8. This complements our business as it's an
opportunity to fully maximize the capacity of the Group's business model.
We focus on motor insurance and homeowners segments, where we are the specialists
not only in Spain and Latin America but also everywhere where we are working.
This complements our search for operational efficiency, providing our policyholders with
excellent service and they have, as we have, rigorous underwriting and investment
policies.
On page nine we are summing the growth potential and the value creation. We think that
the integration with MAPFRE will permit to adopt the technology developed in MAPFRE in
the sector in Spain where we are leaders in online sales.
We can apply our operational excellence model also where we have achieved high levels
of efficiency, as you know very well, in the different markets.

Bloomberg Transcript

We think that we are able to widen the current range of products they have in developing
new lines of business and we have, as a target, to improve the combined ratio of the
business.
The most important thing may be that we believe that we can take advantage of the skills
of these new companies and complement those skills with our own skills in other fields of
the motor insurance. This will be good not only for the Italian and German subsidiaries. But
also for our subsidiaries in Spain, in Latin America and in the USA.
We have a presence already in Italy and Germany through MAPFRE ASISTENCIA and this
allow us to improve the range of our services there and the possibilities of launching new
products in the new subsidiaries acquired.
And as you know very well, the activity of the MAPFRE RE in these markets can help us to
optimize the reinsurance structure of these companies through the cooperation with
MAPFRE RE, where we can be assured of the improvement in the efficiency of these
companies also.
Well I think that these are the main drivers of the rationale of the operation. As usual, I will
open now the Q&A session and, as usual, Mr. Lubelli, who's sat [ph], we are available for
you. Thank you.

Q - Federico Salerno

{BIO 2565091 <GO>}

A few questions, please. How do you intend to finance the deal? I guess you could issue
debt pre-teller rates [ph]; that may be a smart way to do it. Can you say something on
that?
Second question on dividends for 2014. Are you going to take a more prudent view on
the dividend payout, because of the deal?
Then last question is on your other investment in Italy. I'm referring to the stake in
CATTOLICA. Can the deal accelerate a disposal? Again, can you say something about
that? Thank you.

Hi, Federico. Well from the point of view of funding this operation and the size of the
operation is more in comparison with the size of MAPFRE. And our position now in liquidity
and cash -- availability of cash in the undrawn lines in credit we have allow us to funding
this operation without any help of our shareholders.
From the point of view of the dividend payout for 2014, this operation is not affecting at all
the -- our policy, because of the -- if you look at the figures, this company is -- those
companies are incorporating profit from the scratch and the amount of the funding is not
relevant from the point of view of our dividend policy.
So we will keep our commitment of the (inaudible) distribution up to our shareholders and
it will be not affected for this operation.
From the point of view of the investment in Italy, the other investment in Italy, we have
(inaudible). As you know very well, this was the consequence of a business plan that we
introduce with our partners there; at the moment, we are talking about 2007/2008.
This joint venture didn't work from the scratch, because they changed their policy. And we
have this as a financial investment with a company that we consider friends of us.
It's true that we abandoned a long time ago, our intention of developing motor insurance
with CATTOLICA in Italy. This is another operation is totally independent of (inaudible).
And that's it; you'll see it's totally independent.
There are work to do with the investment, it depends on condition of the market and our
attitude about financial investments. But not conditions for this operation.

Q - Atanasio Pantarrotas

{BIO 5933123 <GO>}

First question is on the combined ratio, because Direct Line in Italy has a combined ratio
which is still slightly above 100% [ph], despite the very favorable environment for the
motor market in Italy, which is below 90%.
So my question is how do you think that you can improve this combined ratio? And how
can you achieve some synergies to reduce the cost in order to improve the combined
ratio?

Bloomberg Transcript

The second question is on IT platform. My understanding is that you will have no access to
develop a base into the IT [ph] parties of Direct Line, is it correct? So you will use your
Internet parties for this business? Thank you.

A - Esteban Tejera

{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

Thank you, Atanasio. Even if I say it at the beginning that I hear you, the reality is that the
sound was very poor when you established the question. But in any case, I understood
and I think that I understood correctly.
In the first question of how we are managing to review the combined ratio, at least that is
in this company, over the combined ratio that is the average of the market now in Italy.
Well this is our job and this is the part of job that we do in the daylight in our insurance
companies, we have a track of doing that in different countries and this is one of the main
drivers of the improvement of the company.
It's soon to establish now, the same day that we have acquired the company, the specific
measures in this area. But we have identified possibilities of improvement that we will
show you in the -- next month. But it's is very early to talk about this. But this is one of the
main drivers of development of the company.
The second was. And may be that I didn't understand you correctly, that the IT platform
and our internal (inaudible). I think that we have the skills that are totally complementary.

Direct Line is a well-known company, developing their online business in -- through
telephone. We are now the leaders in Spain in this kind of business in the digital approach
of Internet and VERTI is our bet [ph] in this field.
Even if the development of VERTI, they started only three years ago, we have now more
than 250,000 policies in Spain; we are the leaders by far. And we have our own IT
platform that is prepared to be implemented in other countries. This is our main target
here; to max in the complementarity of the (inaudible) the two approach: the approach of
Direct Line that is leader in Italy now; and complement this with our own IT, in order to
take advantage of the skills of both Groups.

Q - Javier Bernat

{BIO 1704575 <GO>}

My question is regarding the schedule of the deal. When do you expect this to be
completed? That's the first question.

Bloomberg Transcript

The second question is regarding when do you expect this deal to be accretive, if it's
going to be accretive since the first year or the second year? Thank you.

A - Esteban Tejera

{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

I don't know what -- in terms of the schedule, the schedule depends on -- as always, on
the approval of the regulators in Italy and Germany. And I suppose that it will take some
months as usual.
And in terms of the accretive, there is a credit or not, it's a credit. But I imagine that Luigi
will give you some color to this affirmation. Luigi, do you want to comment?

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. We understand the transaction to be accretive immediately. Firstly,
the company is -- well, immediately, let's say once this company gets into our accounts, of
course, which as Mr. Tejera was saying, is something on which we cannot, as yet, put a
precise date.
The company is profitable and, basically, these days, as you can imagine, the returns on
the investment on our cash are relatively limited, let's say. So clearly, it's beneficial almost
immediately, yes.

Rodrigo Vazquez, N+1.

Q - Rodrigo Vazquez

{BIO 17490418 <GO>}

I have a couple of questions. The first one is what return investment do you expect to
reach and in what time frame?
The second one is do you expect any restructuring charges to -- after acquisition? Could
you provide more detail on the synergies?
And finally, is the EUR16.5 million profit before tax of the first half of the year, it's a run rate
we should expect for the following semesters? Thank you.

A - Esteban Tejera

{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi, Rodrigo. If I understood well, you have three questions; one is in ROI; the other is in
synergies; and the other is in profit before tax.
Starting for the last one, according to the information we have, this is a company that now
is in the range of -- these two companies are on the range of profit before taxes of
EUR30 million in the year -- in the current year, according to the figures from the first
semester.
Well this year, the figures are -- well, they are and the improvements of the company will
wait until the next year obviously. But the main driver of the acquisition is what we can do
with the company and what we can do with the management team of these companies
with our management teams working together in developing a business model that we
are introducing successfully in Spain and in other countries. And we can implement now in
these other markets.
Our figures show that there will be a return on investment that will be able to outpace the
charge of the investment and we are creating value that is bigger than the goodwill from
the very beginning of the operation.
From the point of view of synergies, I have told about these. In the synergies currently
apart from the side of increasing our income, in developing new products and growth
than the typical synergies of a merger, where two companies merger. And there is a
simple reduction of costs.
Cutting costs here is not the main driver. The main drivers are improvement, efficiency,
growth. And a better restructure of the reinsurance through the cooperation with our
reinsurance company, MAPFRE RE. And the cooperation with our current operations in

Page 7 of 16

those countries, through MAPFRE ASISTENCIA. And our previous presence in these
countries.

FINAL

Okay. Thank you.

Operator
Avinash Singh, Nomura.

Q - Avinash Singh

{BIO 17348287 <GO>}

A few questions; the first question would be do you have any medium-term financial
target for this acquisition. I see a EUR550 million price for a EUR30 million pre-tax profit is
not very attractive. So do you have in terms of like any profit target, say, by 2015 or 2016?
That was my first question.
Second question would be what sort of screening criteria did you apply for this acquisition,
because one would have expected you to make some acquisitions in growth markets -- in
a new growth market or rather to strengthen your position in, let's say, Turkey or the
Philippines. So what criteria you applied before going for this acquisition?

Bloomberg Transcript

Lastly, what is going to be the impact of this acquisition on your solvency capital?

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Profit targets, there's nothing we can refer explicitly to, because we have not included
them in the presentation. But I think what Mr. Tejera just said goes in answering the
previous question, goes in the line of what you're saying.
I think it's useful just to go back through it, because I imagine this is a focus for everyone
on the line to begin with. Our suggestion to you is do not just focus on the asset, because
this is certainly a very good asset. We think we've bought two excellent companies, which
are good in their own right. But then there's a strategic value for MAPFRE beyond. And in
addition to, these two countries.
The first part is what Mr. Tejera just said is, under MAPFRE, these companies can grow
more and be more profitable. Why can they grow more? Because we can provide them
with knowhow, with their existing product range and, therefore, enhance their existing
product range. Then add new lines, because I imagine someone -- or everyone will give
us credit for that. MAPFRE is a pretty competent global non-life player; so that is a top-line
development.
On this greater volume, we can have these companies be more efficient and more
profitable, because, in addition to sharing best practices, we have a more-efficient IT
platform, which, by the way, enables and facilitates sales of products through the Internet.
And we, of course, have a global reinsurance company onboard.
Page 8 of 16



Company N ame: M apfre SA

FINAL

So we can optimize the structure of the sections of this company, clearly, in a way that we
understand -- with capabilities, that we understand, its former owner did not have. So let's
say, this is the first reading of the transaction on the value creation on the companies
themselves, standalone.
Then, as Mr. Tejera way saying previously, a very relevant value for us is that we can
combine their knowledge, which is distinguished especially on the phone sales and,
generally speaking, various channel sales with our knowledge on the Internet, which we
have developed successfully with both VERTI and InsureandGo in the UK, plus our
generalized knowledge in non-life.
That allows us to develop a model for direct insurance distribution, which we will deploy in
the countries in which MAPFRE operates globally, which are clearly many more countries
than its previous owner has.
This is the way in which it has to be read. We consider that what we are going to gain,
both as the companies themselves. And especially through the deployment of this
combined knowledge in many more countries, far exceeds what we are paying for this
company at present.
Am I answering your question?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Esteban Tejera

{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

No. I think there was a question also about our impact in the Solvency II. From this point of
view --

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

I was answering the first question on the profit target of the speaker.

A - Esteban Tejera

{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

Yes. But in any case I would like to remark that from the point of view of the solvency, our
financial strength and our solvency position is good enough not to affect it for this in the
short term. In the medium term, in the value creation of the company will be enough.
In any case, these introduce, from the point of view of risk management, a diversification
in terms of exposure to the euro; so that is good for us.
From the point of view of enriching our presence in the traditional lines of -- personal lines
were the requirements of capital. And our track of results are very good, are very-well
balancing our position in Solvency II. So there is no concern about this in the near future.
We are assured of having a better position in terms of the solvency issues.

Okay. As a follow-up to that, will you be looking to explore or exploit those platforms
beyond your direct insurance for other businesses?

FINAL

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Well no; that's not exactly what we said. What we said that we are going to exploit this
platform in other countries. Let's say, we are going to enhance what we are acquiring in
Germany and Italy. We will deploy what we have there, combined with what we have
elsewhere, especially England and Spain, in other countries. But it's on -- we are focusing
on retail business.
You were also asking before under what criteria did we do this transaction. As you surely
remember, our Executive Chairman in the AGM mentioned the fact that we had a clear
strategy of doubling, in five years' time, our presence in Europe and of developing
globally a direct insurance business.
Basically, just by itself this transaction achieves the first target, which is doubling the size in
Europe, because virtually that is what it does; we go from about EUR700 million in
premiums to about EUR1.4 billion.
Secondly, as I hope I've explained in detail -- I've described in detail, it's really an
opportunity for a major advance in our ability to rollout a direct insurance proposal
globally, which was also, as I said, stated as a target by our Chairman at the AGM.

Q - Farquhar Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Just two questions, if I may. Firstly, just coming back to the previous solvency question; I
fully appreciate you're coming to this from a position of capital strength and surplus
capital. But I just wondered if you could actually quantify the impact on the IGD ratio. I think
on my rough estimate, I think we're talking about probably 14percentage points.
Then secondly on the topic of synergies with regards to the reinsurance structure, have
you got any sense of the magnitude of savings or benefits that you might get from that,
either possibly under Solvency II as well? Thanks.

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Good afternoon, Farquhar. Once again, as it is our policy and also regulations we
cannot give you figures, which we have not put in the public documents.
But certainly what we can do is guide you. This is -- let's say, it's an ordinary model
business with a conservative investment portfolio. So in terms of risk addition, I imagine
you can do some work with Italia -- I'm talking Solvency I now here, with the Italian
companies and you -- or Spanish companies, such as MAPFRE FAMILIAR, we can help you
out with that and you can guess it
But just in rough terms, we are talking about a company which has EUR1.5 billion in assets,
which is added to a group, which is close to EUR50 billion in assets. So the marginal risk
added to our Group is perfectly manageable.
In terms of solvency, once again, I will guide you qualitatively, because I cannot provide
you with figures. You have to bear in mind that this year -- that last year, our Group was
very strongly negatively affected by exchange rate. This year, it's actually very much the
reverse.

Bloomberg Transcript

In addition to that, we're only quite positively affected by the behavior of interest rates in
Spain. So if you compare our equity yearend 2013 with what it will likely be at the end of
September and foreseeably at the end of December, what we are adding this year is
much more than what is taken away by the goodwill component of this transaction.
So in both economic capital and regulatory capital terms, it's not a terribly strong impact I
would say. I wonder if this answers your question.

Q - Farquhar Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

It's helpful.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Your second part of the question, remind me please, excuse me, Farquhar, was?

Q - Farquhar Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

It was just you mentioned this kind of synergy from reinsurance with regards to MAPFRE
RE. I wonder whether that's any magnitude there. But I don't imagine (multiple speakers).

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Once again, there's nothing there specifically. But as you can imagine, we -- this happens
with every MAPFRE company. We have a certain degree of retention.
Let's say MAPFRE retains at two levels: obviously, MAPFRE retains at the operating
company; then every MAPFRE company cedes to MAPFRE RE, which when it's a MAPFRE

Page 11 of 16

FINAL

company, normally retrocedes most of what it gets from the subsidiary. But it does keep
something at its level [ph].
So we will be revising that. I cannot give you a precise answer now. But, as you can
imagine, this company comes into the fold of a much larger Group and of a Group which, I
believe that we can state credibly, has certain knowhow in reinsurance and how to deal
with it in non-life. So this should be -- you should expect a segregated retention going
forward within the Group.

Q - Farquhar Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks very much.

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Given that M&A appears to have returned perhaps a little bit quicker to the MAPFRE
agenda than at least I expected, I wanted to ask a little bit about your future -- potential
future plans for this.

Bloomberg Transcript

First of all, I was curious to know: what do you think your capacity for doing M&A would
potentially be in the future?
What sort of funding options would you consider? I know this deal was all cash. But would
you consider, for example, raising debt or raising equity capital to do future deals?
Second of all, I wanted to ask a little bit about how you think about valuation. I appreciate
this appears to have been a strategic deal. But could you give us some formal sense of
what form of upper limit you apply to the current valuations you're happy to pay for these
types of assets? Thank you.

A - Esteban Tejera

{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

Thank you. Well from the point of view of our policy of merger and acquisitions, I think that
this policy was clearly established in the past remarks [ph] of our Chairman in the last -two last AGM.
We have operations traditionally strong -- very strong, I would say, in Spain, in Latin
America. We have a presence that is remarkable now in the USA. And we had a situation
where our Chairman established summary [ph] of the focus that were clear.
One was Europe. The other was keeping our leadership presence in Latin America and
Spain, obviously; and be open to new opportunities of growth, mainly organic but also
could be inorganic, in the country where we have a presence and we have the opportunity

Page 12 of 16



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2014-09-25

of increasing the presence. And he mentioned specifically Mexico, USA and some areas
of Europe.

FINAL

Well say [ph] that our policies only acquire companies where the opportunity is
complementary with our business model and our strategy and within the fields what we
have positioned that a long while to take advantage of these kind of acquisitions.
You look at our acquisitions in the last year, we were in acquisitions that we have been
very calm, meaning than seven years. And with a view to the fact not of not having seen a
lot of opportunities. But applying rigorous criteria about the -- how one investment match
or not with our strategy.
In this sense, these two companies, in Italy and Germany, according to our analysis, are
companies that are perfectly within our strategy of diversifying geographically the
business; entering in business that -- in segment of the market that has very high potential
growth.
We are entering into Direct Line car insurance in Europe. That is a growing segment within
this guidance; that is our specialty. These are the criteria.

Bloomberg Transcript

If there is something that matches from the point of view of the size. And size is important
also in this case, from the point of view of complementarity and from the point of view of
new [ph] development, we will be there. But if not, we will remain calm and it's not a
question of entering in a rush for new acquisitions.
With these, we have complete our targets for the next year and we will be open if there
are new opportunities obviously. But these kind of opportunities, that match so well with
our strategy, not every day happen and we had taken advantage of this opportunity, in
order to implement our strategy.
To the other questions, I think that Luigi can continue.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon, Sami. Once again, valuation creating, thank you for asking that. I'll
start from the third one, because I think it somehow hooks better with what Mr. Tejera just
said.
As we always say when we're asked this question in our transactions, we don't reinvent
the wheel when we value an acquisition. We look at multiples and we look at discounted
cash flows. We have looked, clearly, at cash flows here. We've used what we consider to
be reasonably conservative discount rates, in order to get at our valuation.
But the important thing. And I would like to repeat that, we have not only looked at the
cash flows that we were deriving from the assets -- we expecting to derive from the

Page 13 of 16



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2014-09-25

FINAL

assets. We've also looked at the cash flows that we expect to generate elsewhere thanks
to this acquisition.
The total amount is what makes sense to us. So we -- and in that sense, call it a strategic
reasoning, you can call it a strategic reasoning. But let's say we've seen this company
globally added to MAPFRE in total. The valuation criteria really, we do not have a special
MAPFRE machine for making valuations. We use traditional and well-tested evaluation
approaches.
The capacity for acquisition, it's certainly not something we would say openly and fully.
Also, it's another question that can be answered theoretically, because it very much
depends on the asset that you're buying.
But just to assuage your concerns, I think MAPFRE is one of, if not the least, indebted
Group there is in the European insurance industry. We basically have, not to say no senior
debt but very little senior debt.

Bloomberg Transcript

We have an almost unused hybrid debt capacity and we have a EUR750 million syndicated
line which is fully undrawn. We had about EUR1.2 billion, if my memory doesn't fail me, in
cash at the close of June, a part of course, which will be used for this transaction when the
time comes.
So please don't understand this as we are going to use all powder and weapons over the
next month, as Mr. Tejera said; but, let's say, we have reasonable capacity if need be. But
once again, don't take it as we are going to buy anything large, anything soon, because
that is not the message.

Q - Unidentified Participant
I have a quick follow-up question on the dividend policy. You said that you wouldn't change
the dividend policy. Could you just confirm that you would not use the scrip dividend as a
tool, as you have done in the past? Thank you.

Yes, for sure, this is happening that we used, at the very beginning of the crisis in Spain.
And we have undone this policy several years ago.

FINAL

We were the first to use the scrip dividend in Spain, as I can remember. But we were -- we
have undone this kind of policy, before the other groups started to implement these in
Spain. We have no intention in the short term or the medium term to use this again,
because we have no need, at all, look for more money coming from our shareholders.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Okay. Thanks very much.

It's a follow-up question on an unrelated topic, which is Spanish motor, if you don't mind.
We've seen some positive news again in Spain these past few weeks. Are you changing
your view about frequency? Do you think it might begin to rebound, or can you remind me
what your view is at this point, please?

Well Federico, I think we will have opportunities in the next days and in our Third Quarter
presentation of going more in this details of the evolution of the Spanish market. We will
have more information according to the evolution of the month of September.
It's true that the situation -- the economic situation, in Spain has improved and then we
have registered a slight increase in the frequency. But the figures now can be -- must be
followed with the figures of September, because during July and August there are
disturbances due to the holiday period.
In any case, nothing worrying about the evolution of the loss ratio in Spain. But I think that
today is not the day to talk about this in Spain, because we're not -- we can last here for
several hours. We will be at your disposal, our department of -- that you know very well.
And in our next meeting in London and in the Third Quarter presentation.

Q - Federico Salerno

{BIO 2565091 <GO>}

Sure, thank you very much.

A - Esteban Tejera

{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

Well if you haven't any more questions, I think that we can finish just in time. I would like to
thank you again for attending our conference call.

I think that in the near future we can give you more details of this operation. I hope that
these details will be good and will make you more comfortable with the acquisition we
have done.
