Greetings. And welcome to the Markel Corporation Third Quarter 2013 earnings
conference call. (Operator Instructions). It is my pleasure to introduce your host, Tom
Gayner, President and Chief Investment Officer. Thank you. Mr. Gayner, you may begin

Thomas Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Thank you, Rob. Good morning. Welcome to the Markel Corporation 2013 Third Quarter
conference call. My name is Tom Gayner, and it is my privilege to greet you this morning,
and in a few minutes. Turn [ph] things over to our Chief Financial Officer, Anne Waleski,
and my Co-Presidents, Mike Crowley and Richie Whitt to give you a brief update on how
things are going at Markel these days.
Prior to this call, I was speaking with one of our long-term shareholders about the
conference call process. He told me he has owned the stock for about 20 years, and that
our call was boring. He said he really could not imagine us saying anything in the call that
would change his mind about Markel and his long-term ownership of the stock. I thanked
him for his honesty. And Actually I agreed with him.
My number one goal is actually to still be here 20 years from now and delivering a report
just as boring as this one. I suspect what he told me is true for our loyal and long-term
owners to provide us with the capital we need to run this business. I also suspect it is true
for shorter term followers of the stock to usually issue a sell recommendation
immediately following this call. As the character Inigo Montoya said in the Princess Bride,
you keep using that word.

FINAL

I do not think it means what you think it does. I will leave it to those of you with access to
the long-term charts of Markel to decide which unchanging point of view you wish to
embrace. The force that propelled the 27 year line on the chart up and to the right cannot
be found within the cells of the spreadsheet.
Boring works for me when it comes to talking about our financial results. We should not be
that exciting. I am all in favor of grinding it out along the same lines as we have to our 27
years as a public company. We have looked after the capital that you have entrusted to
us, and we have produced wonderful returns for the owners of this Company.
Roughly speaking, the longer you have owned Markel, the more money you have made.
By the way, while it may look and sound boring, I can promise you that we are having a lot
of fun doing this. There is not a day that goes by when I do not hear laughter in this office.
In addition, there are some days when we are simply stunned by what happened. I
promise you that we are not boring. We are not prelude, let me share with you what I do
consider the most boring part of our call, i.e. the Safe Harbor statement.

Bloomberg Transcript

But our General Counsel advices me to share with you. During our call today, we may
make Forward-looking statements. Additional information about factors that could cause
actual results to differ materially from those projected in the Forward-looking statements
is included under the captions risk factors and safe harbor precautionary statements in our
most recent annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly report on form 10-Q.
We may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in the call today. You may find a
reconciliation to GAAP to these measures on our website at www.markelcorp.com and or
quarterly report and form 10-Q. Ann.

Anne Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

Thank you, Tom for always starting us out with a smile. Good morning, everyone. I am
pleased to be able to report that for the first nine months of 2013, we have produced
strong underwriting results and profitable growth in each of our legacy operating
segments.
The Alterra segment has performed within expectations, and we continue to make
significant progress with the integration efforts. Out total operating revenues grew 39%
to $3 billion in 2013 from $2.2 billion in 2012.
The increase is due to a 42% increase in revenues from our insurance operations which
include $531 million from the Alterra segment and 41% increase in revenues from our noninsurance operations which we refer to as Markel Ventures. Moving into the underwriting
results, for the nine months of 2013, gross (inaudible) premiums were $2.9 billion which is
an increase 53% compared to 2012.

Company N ame: M arkel Corp
Company Ticker: M K L US Equity
Date: 2013-11-07

FINAL

The increase in 2013 was primarily due to $715 million of premiums from the Alterra
segment since our acquisitions on May 1st of 2013 as well as higher gross premium
volumes in Specialty Admitted and Excess Surplus lines segment. The increase in Specialty
Admitted is driven by premiums from the Haggerty and Tomco businesses. Within the
Excess and Surplus lines segment, the increase is due in part to the impact of more
favorable rates and improving economic conditions.
Net written premiums for 2013 were approximately $2.4 billion up 44% to the prior year
for the same reasons I just mentioned. Net retention was down in the first nine months of
2013 at 83% compared to 89% in 2012.
The decrease in net retention is due to the inclusion of premiums written by Alterra from
May 1st to September 30th, 2013. Net retention in the Alterra segment for the five month
period was 66%. Net retention for the legacy Markel segments was flat at 89% for both
periods.

Bloomberg Transcript

Earned premiums increased 44%. The increase in 2013 was primarily due to $530 million
of earned premium from the Alterra segment for the five months ended September
30th, 2013 as well as higher earned premium volume in the Specialty Admitted and
Excess and Surplus lines segment. The increase in Specialty Admitted is due to earned
premiums from the Haggerty and Tomco businesses.
Our combined ratio was 97% for the first nine months of 2013 compared to 96% in 2012.
The increase in the combined ratio was due to a lower prior year loss ratio partially offset
by a lower expense ratio compared to the same period in 2012. During 2013, the benefit
of the favorable development of prior year's loss reserves had less of an impact on the
combined ratio when compared to the same period in 2012 due to higher earned
premiums in the current year.
The 2013 results were also impacted by Alterra segment which added six points to the
combined ratio driven by $70 million of merger and acquisition costs and $33 million of
cash-fee losses. Favorable development on prior year loss reserves increased to $281
million or 12 points compared to $260 million or 17 points in 2012. These amounts are net
of $28 million in 2013 and $31 million in 2012 of unfavorable loss reserve development on
asbestos and environmental exposures within our discontinued line segment.
We complete our annual review of these exposures during the Third Quarter of each year.
During this year's review, our expectation of this severity of the outcome for known claims
increased, and we increased our prior year loss reserves accordingly.
The decrease in the expense ratio for the first nine months of 2013 is driven by higher
earned premiums in our legacy Markel segments compared 2012 partially offset by the
impact of the merger and acquisition costs incurred by Alterra. Excluding the merger and
acquisition costs incurred in 2013, the inclusion of Alterra had a favorable impact on the
expense ratio. Alterra has had a lower expense ratio than we have had historically.

FINAL

The expense ratio for 2012 was unfavorably impacted by the perfective adoption of the
new DAC standards which increased our expenses by $41 million or 3 points on the 2012
combined ratio. Next I will discuss the results of the Markel Ventures. In the first nine
months of 2013, revenues from Markel Ventures were $486 million compared to $345
million in 2012.
Net income to shareholders for Markel Ventures was $18 million in 2013 compared to $9
million in 2012. EBIDTA was $64 million in 2013 as compared to $41 million in 2012.
Revenues, net income to shareholders, and EBIDTA from Markel Ventures increased in the
first nine months of 2013 compared to the same period of 2012 primarily as a result of
more favorable results at AMF bakery systems and our acquisitions of Haveco and
Redding bakery systems.
Next, we will turn to the investment results. Investment income was up in 2013 to just
under $229 million. Net investment income for 2013 included $44 million of investment
income attributable to Alterra which was net of $39 million in amortization expense from
adjusting Alterra's fixed maturity securities to a new amortized cost basis at the
acquisition date.

Bloomberg Transcript

Net investment income also included favorable changes in the fair value of our credit
default swap of $9 million as compared to $14 million for 2012. Excluding the impact of
Alterra and the credit default swap, net investment income for the first nine months of
2013 decreased compared to 2012 due in part to a decrease in our fixed maturities and
an increase in cash and cash equivalents.
Net realized investment gains for 2013 were $41 million compared to $25 million in 2012.
Included in net realized gains were $4.6 million of other then temporary impairments as
compared to $4.2 million in 2012.
Tom will discuss investments further in his comments. Looking at our total results for the
nine months, our effective tax rate was 28% in 2013 compared to an effective tax rate of
19% in 2012. The increase is primarily due to higher estimated earnings taxed at a 35%
rate and due to anticipating a smaller tax benefit related to tax-exempt investment
income as a result of projecting higher pre-tax income for 2013 and 2012.
We reported net income to shareholders $182 million compared to $197 million in 2012.
Book value per share increased to approximately 14%to $462 per share at September
30th, 2013 from $404 per share at year end. Increase is primarily due to equity issued in
connection with the acquisition of Alterra and $253 million of comprehensive income to
shareholders.
Finally, I will make a few comments about cash flow and balance sheet. Net cash provided
by operating activities was $542 million for the nine months ended September 30th, 2013
compared to $240 million for the same period of 2012. The increase was driven by higher
cash flows from underwriting activities and investment activities.

Page 4 of 15



Company N ame: M arkel Corp
Company Ticker: M K L US Equity
Date: 2013-11-07

FINAL

The increase in cash flows from underwriting activities is primarily the result of the
acquisition of Alterra and higher premium volume primarily in our Specialty Admitted and
Excess Surplus lined segments. Invested assets at the holding company were $1.1 billion at
September 30th compared to $1.4 billion at year end.
The decrease in invested asset is primarily the result of cash paid for the Alterra
acquisition partially offset by net increase in debt. I would like to close with a quick
mention of the announcement we made on October 9th, 2013 regarding our offer to
acquire Abbey Protection, the UK-based Integrated Specialist Insurance and Consultancy
Group. Subject to shareholder and regulatory approval, we expect this to close in January
of 2014. At this point, I will turn it over to Mike to further discuss operations.

F. Michael Crowley

{BIO 6836605 <GO>}

Thank you, Anne. Good morning. The results for legacy Markel North American operations
were very good and continue the positive trend we have seen during the year. Gross
written premiums increased 20% over prior year in the Third Quarter and 23% over prior
year or nine months.

Bloomberg Transcript

E&S segment performed well again with all five regions again showing growth. Gross
written premiums increased 8% over prior year in the quarter and 12% over prior year for
nine months. The combined ratio of 87.8% for the quarter was one point better than prior
year.
The year to date combined ratio was 80.9% compared to 90.6% for the same period last
year. The segment continues to improve operating efficiency and the service to our
agents and brokers.
Confirmation of this comes from the fact that annualized premiums for underwriters is up
over 8% and the upgrades to our wholesale portal continues to receive very positive
reviews from our agents. During the quarter, we announced that John Latham, President
of the E&S division will be stepping down from that position on January 1st of 2014. John
has begun plans for retirement in 2016, and has elected to spend the final two years with
Markel focusing on our customers and assisting me with special projects.
John has done an exceptional job leading the E&S division over the past few years. He is
to be commended for excellent results that we are realizing today. I want to emphasize
that this is John's decision, and he will remain fully engaged at Markel over the next
couple of years.
Brian Sanders who joined Markel with the Alterra acquisition will assume the position of
President of the E &S division effective Jan 1, 2014. Bryan has a long and outstanding
background in the wholesale world having been in the industry for 32 years. He has
served in leadership positions with Alterra, Max Specialty, and HRH where we worked
together. We have great confidence that Bryan will continue the success achieved under
John's leadership.

FINAL

The Specialty Admitted segment also had a very good quarter gross written premiums
increased 37% over prior year in the quarter and are up 39% year-to-date. The combined
ratio in the quarter was 90.3 or 18.9 points lower than prior year due to lower calendar
year loss ratio and higher prior year takedowns.
Year-to-date combined ratio is 108 or 7.4 points lower than prior year. As Anne said, the
increase in gross written premiums in the Specialty division continues to be driven by the
Haggerty and Tomco businesses.
In the segment, we are continuing to execute on our plans which we talked about on our
last call to exit unprofitable lines in non-renews, certain specific accounts in order to
improve our underwriting results for this segment. With regards to our product line
leadership headed by Jerry Albanis, the quarter was very active. We are continuing to
execute plans integrating the Alterra professionals within the product line leadership
group.

Bloomberg Transcript

They have successfully combined brokerage property teams and have adopted the
Alterra property integration tools and pricing for the book. Mike Miller who led the marine
practice at Alterra has expanded his responsibilities and has both commercial ocean
marine and middle marine reporting to him. We continued to hold joint-product meetings
across the organization including professionals from Alterra, Wholesale Specialty, and
Markel International to foster closer working relationships among these professionals.
Meetings have been held with the marine property professional liability and energy
teams. We have also now consolidated all of our homeowner business into our personal
lines division under Audrey's Hankins leadership. Previously this business resided in Alterra
wholesale and our personal lines operations.
The only comment that I will make with regard to the rate environment is that we are
getting modest rate increases although down slightly from earlier end of year. In
summary, a very good quarter for North American operations. I will turn the call over to
Richie Whitt.

Richard Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Thank you, Mike and good morning, everyone. I will start my comments with Markel
international's nine month results, and then give an update on the Alterra integration.
Markel international had an amazingly consistent, and sticking with Tom's theme,
somewhat boring result for the first nine months of 2013. When I say boring, I mean that in
the absolute best of ways. Boring is good in insurance.
International produced consistently strong results driven by solid prior accident year
reserve releases and like capacity losses. Gross written premiums increased 3% to $725
million. Areas of growth included our Specialty book as well as our Singapore and
Netherlands branches. Pricing trends have been very consistent throughout the year with
modest single-digit price increases.

FINAL

However, in many areas of the market things remain competitive particularly CATexposed properties, both insurance and re-insurance, professional liability, retail and
equine lines. There is much discussion in the industry on where pricing trends are headed
right now. At Markel, we are going to continue to push for price increases. Given the
current interest rate environment, there really is no room to reduce rates and produce
acceptable returns.
International combined ratio for the nine months of 2013 and 2012 was an 88 combined.
As I have said previously, both years benefited from relatively light catastrophe losses and
solid prior accident year reserve releases. While the nine months results were delightfully
boring at Markel International, the team was extremely busy and anything but bored with
the integration of Alterra going on and the announcement of the proposed acquisition of
Abbey Protection.
As Anne said, if all goes as expected, this deal will close in January next year. We are
extremely excited to add the Abbey team to Markel International. Abbey adds unique
retail products and services to our international insurance portfolio, and we see
opportunities to grow their already strong franchise and legal expense and professional
fee protection.

Bloomberg Transcript

I would like to give a quick update on the acquisition of Alterra. It has been approximately
six months since the deal closed on May 1st. We have made excellent progress bringing
the two organizations together. With every day that passes, things feel more and more
like business as usual.
As Anne stated, Alterra's results have largely been in line with our expectations. This is a
really important statement. As our expectations for Alterra are very high. Within the
Alterra segment, premium volume in the global insurance and re-insurance divisions have
met and in some cases exceeded expectations and are in line with prior year's volume.
Lines of business that will ultimately become part of Markel International in Excess and
Surplus have also performed well. The Alterra segment results for the nine months which
includes $70 million in merger and acquisition costs are again in line with our expectations.
We have begun the process of establishing a margin of safety on loss reserves. This is
similar to what we have done with all past acquisitions.
We are looking forward to the day in is not too distant future when we know longer talk
about legacy Markel and Alterra and simply discuss our Markel results. We are well on our
way at this point. As I stated last quarter, we have some work to do with systems and our
back office processes in order to fully integrate all elements of Alterra operations into our
existing model. As such, we are managing and recording the results of the legacy
operations which include U.S. insurance, Alterra at Lloyds, Global Insurance and Global Reinsurance as our Alterra segment and expect to do this for the remainder of the year.
We have several initiatives in place to make the changes in systems and processes that
are necessary in order to implement a new segment reporting structure by the First
Quarter of next year. You also note that we included the legacy Alterra life and annuity
Page 7 of 15

book which is in runoff in our other discontinued line segment. With one quarter to go, we
are on target for an excellent year with outstanding underwriting profits and very nice
book value growth. I would like to turn it over to Tom.

FINAL

Thomas Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Thank you, Richie. As we have alluded to earlier, we are delighted to report our year-todate results to you. In our investment operations, we earned 23.2% on our equity portfolio
for the first nine months of 2013.
Amazingly enough, that is an outperformance of 350 basis points compared to the S&P
500 return of 19.7%. Let me repeat, we are 350 basis points ahead. Normally I would
expect to under-perform in a rip roaring bull market since we are conservative and
defensive in nature. We will not complain about it though.
More importantly, this continues a multi-decade record of superior investment return. I
think it is fair to say that our four-part investment discipline of investing in profitable
businesses with good returns on unlevered capital, with honest and talented managers,
capital discipline re-investment opportunities at fair prices works. It is time tested, and we
are sticking to it.

Bloomberg Transcript

In our fixed income operations, we earned a return of a negative 0 .06%. Interest rates
are moving up, and Detroit among others is going bankrupt. As such we are keeping our
duration short and credit quality as high as we know how to make it.
In total, we earned 4.5% on our investments, and I am very pleased with those results as
they contributed meaningfully to the comprehensive income of the Markel Corporation.
We are methodically adding capital to our equity portfolio and expect continue to do so.
At Markel Ventures, total revenues was 40% to $486 million from $345 million a year ago.
Our share of EBIDTA from the Company rose 54% to $64.2 million up from $41.5 million a
year ago.
During the Third Quarter, we added Eagle Construction to the family. Eagle is the leading
Richmond-based home builder. We have known the principles of the company for two
generations.
We formally worked with them together for several years in our Markel-Eagle joint
venture, and we are delighted to welcome the home building organization to Markel. One
data point to help understand our respect for Eagle, is that in 2008 and 2009 when the
construction industry collapsed and home building stood at the very epicenter of the
financial crisis, Eagle remained profitable.
These are our kind of people, and we could not be happier that they are with us now.
Finally, I would like to close with one thought that I think separates Markel Corporation
from so many other companies and even from Markel in its earlier days. Namely from
Page 8 of 15

Date: 2013-11-07

FINAL

where we sit today, we get to see opportunities to deploy capital in our existing insurance
businesses, new insurance opportunities, publicly-traded securities, privately held
businesses expansions to businesses we already own, and too an increasing robust
network of people we know and have done business with.
Some people would call this yield flow. I think a better my name for it is idea flow. It
creates a 360-degree view of the world. I believe this is highly unusual and incredibly
valuable.
Most companies are more constrained in their notions to what they can and will do and
how they think about the allocation of capital. We are a comprehensive Company. We
have a comprehensive idea flow that covers the water front, and we have experience at
successfully re-investing our capital and all sorts of businesses all around the world. There
is not a long list of organizations with those characteristics and the demonstration of to
doing it reasonable well.
Hang on, folks, we are just getting started, and we look forward to your questions about
the firm. Rob, if you would open up the floor for questions for us.

from SunTrust Robinson. Please proceed with your question.

Q - Doug Mewhirter

{BIO 7026139 <GO>}

Hello. Good morning. I just had one question for Mike. I notice in the Specially Admitted
business the reserve releases in this quarter actually accelerated. I was wondering what
accident years or what sublines or segments did you see that? I guess related to that
question, how your efforts to I guess re-price or improve the workers comp business is
going?

A - F. Michael Crowley

{BIO 6836605 <GO>}

One, it t is going very well. Two, first comp drove a lot of that Anne what was it the 11 to 12
years?

A - Anne Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

Right.

A - F. Michael Crowley

{BIO 6836605 <GO>}

That were we had the releases. That business is performing very well. A lot of it also has
to do with the move of premium to California to non-California business and it is growing.

{BIO 7026139 <GO>}

FINAL

Actually it reminded me of another question. There has been a couple competitors in the
workers comp space who have had some trouble, and I am not sure how much overlap
you had with them. Has that triggered any positive disruption in the market for you where
you are seeing more submissions, or you are getting a tiny bit more price leverage
because of less supply in the market?

A - F. Michael Crowley

{BIO 6836605 <GO>}

We are getting rate. I cannot comment on where that business is coming from. We are
growing. We are getting rate. We are moving into different geographic areas. In the
business, I have said for a number of quarters, that First Comp it is performing and on the
path that we had set out for them when we acquired them in November of 2010. They
are executing their business extremely well in a touch comp environment. We could not
be more pleased with the direction of that business.

Our next question comes from the line of Mark Dwelle of RBC Capital Markets. Please
proceed with your question.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Good morning. Just a couple questions. Richie, you talked a little bit about the Abbey
Protection. Can you give us a little sense of what their historic level of premiums has been
and where their combines ratios are and things like that to kind of frame the possibilities
there?

A - Richard Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Sure. Sure. It is a bit of a hybrid business, Mark. You have to think of it in terms of revenues
really quite honestly.
It is both an underwriting business and a service business. Historically, about 40 million
pounds in revenues so call that about $60 million. They have been able to drop about 10
million pounds call it about $15 million to the bottom line.
It is a combination of underwriting risk where they take underwriting risk on legal
protection or other professional services like if a person that is brought in on a tax audit or
something like that by the Internal Revenue in the U.K. as well as they provide services
such as advice, legal advice and some of that tax advice.
It is an interesting business because it is a little bit insurance. It is a little bit service. It fits
very nicely into our retail operation. It gives us additional products sets to offer our small

Page 10 of 15



Company N ame: M arkel Corp
Company Ticker: M K L US Equity
Date: 2013-11-07

to medium-sized retail customers. So we think it really kind of expands what we can do in
the U.K. retail market.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

FINAL

Thank you. That is helpful background. The question I guess maybe for Anne or Tom.
The level of cash on the balance sheet. Not with anyone the investment classification, but
just the actual cash. It is probably the highest I have ever seen it. Is this just taking the
opportunity to build cash resources with the debt markets the way they have been, or do
you have some other kind of allocation in mind for some of that cash?

A - Thomas Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

The number one spectacular reason that it keeps growing is because we are making a lot
of money. That is a good thing. The bottom portfolio for instance as I have said is not
really much of a yield curve.

Bloomberg Transcript

It is a yield line. The opportunity cost of staying short and staying in cash and preserving all
the optionality for what you want to do with it does not incur much in the way of
opportunity costs. So those are some factors going on. The other factor is we did just do
a major acquisition.
We have another one in the works right now. We are buying companies in Markel
Ventures. We have a lot opportunities to deploy that. But as always, you can expect us to
be careful and methodical about how the way we would go about it. You can also expect
at some point that with higher interest rates which I expect, we will invest the bond
portfolio in a longer term than what we do right now.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Okay. Fair enough. One last thing just a numbers question for Anne. You were saying the
portion of amortization related to the Alterra piece of investment income that was $39
million you said?

A - Anne Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

That is correct.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

They earned $44 million and the amortization was $39 million. So really almost no benefit
this quarter.

A - Thomas Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

No the $44million was net of the $39 million.

A - Anne Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

Right.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

FINAL

Got it.

A - Thomas Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Also, that is an interesting feature of our financial since we took over Alterra. You are not
seeing a huge increase in investment income because of the amortization. Where you
see it is in the cash flow. $540 million of cash flow is a significant increase over what we
had at this point in the last year. That amortization explains some of the defense between
what you are seeing through the P&L and what you are seeing on the cash flow
statement.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

That is very helpful. Thank you. I will stop there.

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you. A couple of questions. First, is in the Third Quarter it looks like the
Ventures business earnings were a bit lower, quite a bit lower than the run rate of what

there?

A - Anne Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

Jay, I do not actually think there is anything significant going on there if you are comparing
it to the prior period. It could be timing of orders, but in looking through the quarter
results there was not anything worthy of note.

Q - Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

It looked to me like a net of other revenues and expenses have been running $15 million
to $20 million. This quarter looked like closer to $8 million. You are saying even though
(inaudible) that looks like a big drop there is nothing unusual at all?

A - Anne Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

There was not anything unusual in our analysis. I am happy to pick it up with you offline and
go through it. Nothing came up where (inaudible) like I said there can be timing and
seasonality in the numbers. Nothing worthy of comment.

If I would, this is a bit of a guess on my part. What we look at in terms of looking at the
businesses and how they are doing is the EBIDTA and the cash generation of business.
We talked about that earlier. (inaudible). We had previously used as a rough shortcut the
other revenues and other expenses as a pretty good proxy for what is going on. There
are other things that go on in other revenues and other expenses that might distort that
number. The directional information we gave you on the revenues and the EBIDTA of
Markel Ventures is a pretty good description of how things are going there, and they are
going well.

Q - Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

You said a bigger part of the income statement. It would be great to get better disclosure
around that since it is going to growing as well. One quick request. That is all. Second
question, the amortization of the Alterra investment portfolio which is obviously holding
back GAAP investment income. Can you talk about what that number looks like going
forward?

A - Anne Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

The amortization number for Alterra's investment portfolio will be taken accrues the
duration of the portfolio basically. It is going to run for I would guess three or four years
and probably look close to the same quarter over quarter. It will come down some as we
sell securities.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Thomas Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Yes. Maybe a way to think it is roughly, and help me out here, guys, $20 million a quarter
right now. The duration of the portfolio is about probably five years.

A - Anne Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

Four to five years.

A - Thomas Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

That $20 million should sort of trail off over the next four years or so from that $20 million
down to nothing as that securities mature. It is a pretty big number. The day we bought
Alterra was probably close to the low for the rates. They have come back up since then.
We have marked the portfolio up pretty significantly on May 1st. That is what we are
amortizing through.

Q - Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

That makes sense. I am sure it is in the cue, but I just did not see it yet. The unamortized
portion. What does that equal right now?

A - Thomas Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

I do not have that. I am not sure it is in the cue. That is something we would be willing to
put in going forward if it is not. We will get something to you, Jay.

(Operator Instructions). The next question is from Matthew Berry of Lane Five Capital.
Please proceed with your question.

Q - Matthew Berry

{BIO 16846746 <GO>}

Hello everyone. A couple of questions. Richie you spoke about establishing a margin of
safety for the Alterra book. I noticed that the current year loss ratio was improved quarter
over quarter. No prior year developments in there in the Alterra segment. Could you
describe how that process works, how it will evolve over time, and how it will impact the
financials.

A - Richard Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Sure. Very consistent with what we have done with all past acquisitions. We have a policy
or a philosophy at Markel of being more likely redundant then deficient. When we buy
companies, we sort of tread our way into that philosophy by adding a margin of safety to
the current accident year. The reason for the decrease year-over-year was catastrophe
losses in the prior year primarily.
I can assure you, we did take the actuarial pick and did a very consistent methodology to
add a margin of safety to the reserves in the quarter. We will do that as we go forward.
Margin of safety that we have added depends on the type of business that it is. In past
acquisition, it has been anywhere from 4 points to 10 points on the business on the
current accident year as we earn that business. But I guess I would tell you here that
somewhere in that range of what we are adding to the Alterra current accident year as it
is earned onto our books.

Q - Matthew Berry

{BIO 16846746 <GO>}

Okay, and that is consistent with what I see over the long run in terms of reserve releases
and how that cycle works. That makes sense. One for Tom which I wouldn't term in my
limited experience with home builders describe the majority of them as profitable high
risk-owner investment capital with solid management and great reinvestment
opportunities. Could you describe what you see that is different at Eagle, and how they
run their business different from the typical home builder?

A - Thomas Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

The great thing about Eagle as demonstrated by the fact that they remained profitable in
this miserable environment as we could have is that intellectual capital of the organization
is really what matters. You have people who have outstanding relationships with
subcontractors and a network of people who can get things done. The size of the Eagle
organization relative to what they do in terms of people on their payroll. It is actually
relatively small.

FINAL

It is like an accordion. It can expand and shrink back depending on the set of opportunities
that are out there, and they have successfully done it for two generations. We have a lot
of confidence in their ability to continue to do that and that flexibility.
A part of (inaudible) Markel is a huge advantage for them in the sense that when the
appropriate time to add capital and try to seize opportunities and push ahead, we can
support that program . At the same time, when it is time to go in reverse a little and shrink
and hunker down, that is okay.
They can redistribute that capital back to us, and we will find other ways to put it to use. If
you are a standalone monolined-company, you do not typically have that flexibility. Same
sort of thing that we have happening in our insurance businesses, whereas opposed to
one line of insurance, we have a 100. Different times some of them need capital and
others are generating capital, and then the overall corporate environment we can put the
capital to good use.
