I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Marc Grandisson and
Mr. Francois Morin. Sirs, you may begin.

Thank you, Crystal, and good morning to you. Our diversified business model of specialty
insurance, reinsurance and mortgage lines of business produced good growth, and
acceptable risk adjusted returns for our shareholders in the third quarter. Operating
earnings generated an annualized return on common equity of 10% for the third quarter
as our book value per share grew 3.9% and more than 21% on a trailing 12-month basis.

Bloomberg Transcript

Before I discuss market conditions in a broader P&C sector, I would like to address a topic
that is currently getting a lot of attention, namely the increased claims inflation or loss
trend. In this part of the cycle, we are not surprised to hear about adverse claims
development that some in the P&C industry are experiencing. We had discussed our view
of loss trends on these calls over the past several years and I'd like to remind our
shareholders that at Arch, we approach pricing our products and establishing our reserves
with a bias towards conservative loss trend estimates.
As I have mentioned before, history teaches us that on average, the P&C industry
experiences claim inflation rates about 200 basis points above the CPI, although this can
fluctuate over time. It seems to us that the premium rate declines seen by the industry
over the past several years should have led to higher current loss picks. It is important to
bear in mind that in many lines of business, it takes three to five years before an accurate
level of trend can be confirmed.
We believe that this gap between the estimated and actual loss trend has contributed to
the uncertainty in reserve development. This uncertainty helps fuel both disruption and
dislocation in several areas of insurance, which we have been and are capitalizing on.
Dislocation is evident in the rise in our submission activity this year and it is also reflected
by the fact that we are achieving higher rate levels on new business than on renewal
business in several segments.
To give you some sense of the data, our submission activity in the third quarter was up
more than 20% in E&S property and 15% each of E&S casualty and professional lines,
specifically D&O. However, to date, we believe that these disruptions are more indicative
of a transitional market than a traditional hard market as we have not yet seen rate
increases and hardening across the board. Risk selection is still paramount.
Across all lines in our Insurance group, renewal rate changes average a positive 3.5% for
the quarter, as net premium grew 22% in the third quarter, above the same period in
2018. About 30% of that growth came out of an acquisition we completed earlier this year
in the UK small commercial line space. Rate increases contributed a quarter of the overall
segments growth, while new business opportunities generated the balance. It is worth

reminding you that we expect to close on our acquisition of the Barbican Group in the
fourth quarter and we believe that the enhanced presence and scalability of our Lloyd's
operation will provide us with further opportunities.
Now turning to the reinsurance market, reinsurance pricing tends to follow that of the
primary insurance industry, but with a few twists. Catastrophe and large attritional losses
can disproportionately affect reinsurance results, creating localized opportunities in areas
of the reinsurance business. Property fac and marine are examples of improving markets.
Over the past several years, we have significantly reduced our net exposure to property
cat risk in response to the declining level of risk adjusted rates. The occurrence of
Japanese typhoons in both the third and fourth quarter of this year has impacted global
reinsurance industry result and should support the ongoing need for additional rate
improvement.

Turning to our mortgage insurance segment, Arch MI continues to perform well and
market conditions continue to be characterized by strong credit quality and a healthy
housing environment. In terms of new production, our third quarter new insurance written
or NIW grew 18% over the same period a year ago. That production was driven by growth
in the mortgage insurance market due to a broad increase in mortgage originations,
combined with an increase in the level of mortgage insurance purchased from private
mortgage insurers.
Overall, insurance in force grew about 2% sequentially in the quarter at Arch US MI as
higher prepayment activity was more than offset by new MI originations. We continue to
be pleased with the credit quality of our insurance in force as key risk metrics in our US MI
portfolio remain at historically favorable levels.
Notwithstanding the good market conditions in the MI sectors, we continue to mitigate
our downside risk from an economic cat event through the purchase of insurance linked
notes. With respect to our investment operations, we have maintained our focus on total
return and continuously reposition the portfolio to adjust to financial markets conditions,
which contributed significantly to our growth in book value per share this quarter.
And with that, I'll hand the call over to Francois.

Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

Thank you, Marc, and good morning to all. Before I give you some comments and
observations on our results for the third quarter, I wanted to remind you that, consistent
with prior practice, these comments are on a core basis which corresponds to Arch's
financial results, excluding the other segment, i.e., the operations of Watford Holdings
Limited. In our filings, the term consolidated includes Watford.
After-tax operating income for the quarter was $261 million, which translates to an
annualized 10.3% operating return on average common equity and $0.63 per share. Book
value per share grew to $25.61 at September 30th, a 3.9% increase from last quarter and

FINAL

a 21.1% increase from one year ago. This result reflects the effect of strong contributions
from both our underwriting and investment operations.
Starting with underwriting results, losses from 2019 catastrophic events in the quarter net
of reinsurance recoverables and reinstatement premiums stood at $68 million or 5.2
combined ratio points. These losses impacted both our Insurance and reinsurance
segments and were primarily due to Hurricane Dorian and Typhoon Faxai. As for prior
period net loss reserve development, we recognized approximately $51.7 million of
favorable development in the third quarter net of related adjustments or 3.9 combined
ratio points compared to 6.7 combined ratio points in the third quarter of 2018.
All three of our segments experienced favorable development at $3.9 million, $14.7
million, and $33 million for the insurance, reinsurance, and mortgage segments
respectively. We had solid net written premium growth in the insurance segment, 22%
over the same quarter one year ago. While approximately 30% of that growth comes
from the UK regional book of business we acquired earlier this year, we also had a strong
quarter of new business and an improving renewal rate environment in most of our lines
of business.

Bloomberg Transcript

The insurance segment's accident quarter combined ratio excluding cats was 100.3%,
essentially unchanged from the same period one year ago. Some of the pricing and
underwriting actions we have taken over the last several years have begun to filter
through the loss ratio, while our expense ratio remains slightly elevated, primarily as a
result of investments that we are making in the business.
In particular, as discussed on prior calls, the integration of our UK regional book and other
smaller acquisitions is ongoing and increased the overall insurance segment expense ratio
this quarter by approximately 130 basis points. Investments in our underwriting, claims,
and IT operations explain most of the remainder of the increase in the expense ratio. We
continue to expect that the expense ratio for this segment will remain higher than the
long-term run rate until the growth in net written premium we achieved over the last few
quarters both organically and from acquired businesses is fully earned.
Now, moving on to our reinsurance operations, where we also had solid growth this
quarter, with net written premium up 40% over the same quarter one year ago. Over
60% of the growth came from the casualty segment where we were able to write select
new opportunities in distressed sectors of the market, including a multi-year treaty that
represented approximately 65% of the growth for this line of business. As we have said in
the past, some of these opportunities can be lumpy and distort quarter-over-quarter
comparisons.
Property excluding property cat and property cat make up most of the rest of the
increase in net written premium. The reinsurance segment's accident quarter combined
ratio excluding cats stood at 92.8% compared to 92.5% on the same basis one year ago.
Part of the large attritional loss activity we experienced this quarter includes some
exposure to the Thomas Cook collapse. Our expense ratio remained satisfactory at 26%,
down 140 basis points since the same quarter one year ago.

The mortgage segment's accident quarter combined ratio improved by 290 basis points
from the third quarter of last year, as a result of the continued strong underlying
performance of the book, particularly within our US primary MI operations. The calendar
quarter loss ratio of 3.8% is higher by 60 basis points than the result observed in the
same quarter one year ago, although last year's loss ratio benefited from favorable prior
year development that was approximately 320 basis points higher than what was
observed this quarter. The expense ratio was 20.8%, lower by 60 basis points than in the
same period one year ago.
Total investment return for the quarter was a positive 100 basis points on a US dollar
basis, as our high quality portfolio continued to perform well. Our investment portfolio
duration is over-rate relative to our target allocation, up slightly to 3.64 years at quarterend, as we continued to expect a continued slowdown in economic growth and a lower
for longer global interest rate environment.

Bloomberg Transcript

The corporate effective tax rate in the quarter on pre-tax operating income was 11.7% and
reflects the geographic mix of our pre-tax income and a 40 basis point benefit from
discrete tax items in the quarter. Excluding this benefit, the effective tax rate on pre-tax
operating income was 12.1% this quarter. At this time, we believe it's still reasonable to
expect that the effective tax rate on operating income will be in the range of 11% to 14%
for the full year. As always, the effective tax rate could vary depending on the level and
location of income or loss and varying tax rates in each jurisdiction.
Turning briefly to risk management, despite the recent increases in catastrophe pricing,
our natural cat exposures on a net basis remain at historically low levels at October 1 with
the Northeast still representing our peak zone at slightly more than 4% of tangible
common equity at the one and 250-year return level. We remain committed to deploying
more capacity in the segments, if rates and expected returns on catastrophe-exposed
accounts continue to improve over time.
In our mortgage segment, we recently completed our 10th Bellamy transaction earlier this
month with coverage of $577 million. Currently, the in-force Bellamy structures provide
aggregate reinsurance coverage of over $3.7 billion.
With respect to capital management, we did not repurchase any shares this quarter. Our
remaining authorization, which expires in December 2019, stood at $161 million at
September 30th, 2019. Our debt to total capital ratio stood at 13.5% at quarter-end and
debt plus preferred to total capital ratio was 19.5%, down 300 basis points from year-end
2018. In terms of fourth quarter activity, we expect to use resources on hand to fund the
Barbican acquisition at closing once we receive regulatory approvals.
With these introductory comments, we are now prepared to take your questions.

Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Mike Zaremski from
Credit Suisse. Your line is open.

FINAL

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Hey, good morning. In the prepared remarks, I think you talked about some stress in the
marketplace, and it's my understanding that in the primary insurance space, I could be
wrong and it is reinsurance too, it feels like the greatest dislocations kind of in the megasized accounts space where capacity is very constrained. Just curious, is that an
opportunity Arch can gravitate to or that's not your sandbox? Maybe you could talk to
where you see the greatest dislocations in the marketplace, which could benefit you.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

I think your assessment is right on. I think that you will hear on other calls and from the
marketplace that the risks that are larger that carry more limits are going through more
dislocation because competitors are reevaluating their risk appetite and this is where
most of the capacity deployment was, shall I say, overextended in the last several years.
And this is where most remediation is taking place. And you will find that mostly in the E&S
and the large commercial risk and this is where we have seen most of the increase in
submission activity. We had been historically being who we are on the defensive for those
risks and we are very well positioned to take advantage of that. I think we are on the
receiving end of looking at more of those opportunities as we speak and this is where we
are able to flex more of our muscle.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Okay. So just want to confirm, so you obviously have a great rating from the rating
agencies and you have a relatively large balance sheet, but the primary insurance balance
sheet is smaller. So in terms of the counterparties and the brokers, do they see you as -like they look at the total Arch entity balance sheet when kind of assessing whether you
guys can take a big piece of the large account space?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yes, they are, and I think they're also looking at us from a perspective commercial -- some
commercial anecdotes for you that we are one of the few that said we have no
heightened appetite for risks that are priced appropriately and I think the broker
community and client community is very open to that and very willing to engage with us.

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Okay. That's helpful. And switching gears to mortgage insurance, there was a recent
agreement with the FHA and Department of Justice earlier this week, and there has been
some talk about maybe it shifts mortgage insurance volumes, banks coming back to the
FHA and maybe out of the private marketplace. I don't know if you have any thoughts
there, if I am barking up something that could take place.

A - Marc Grandisson

FINAL

I always have thoughts about everything. So my initial comment to you, Mike, is that it's
very early. It was announced last week, it's not only this week. And I think it's an attempt to
decriminalize being -- FHA as a result of the banking system sector sort of being reluctant
to provide FHA product to its channel. But we'll see how that goes and where it ends up.
There are also uncertainties as to whether a different administration would have a
different view. And it's really an agreement with DoJ, like you said, and HUD as to how it
will be treated. It's too early, I will tell you.
In general, what we hear in Washington though is that the private sector is still the most
favored area where the government wants mortgage insurance risk to be deployed. And
we had seen this for many years. We'll see where that takes us, but we're watching it and
we'll have more sense for where it goes and it's going to take a long time over the next
several years.

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

And just one last on the mortgage insurance volumes. Do you -- I believe in past quarters,
you've kind of alluded to maybe giving back some market share as competitors all have
their own proprietary systems. It feels like probably didn't give up market share this
quarter, but it's too early to tell. Is your view still kind of you might, over the next year or
so, move down a little bit of market share? Still strong obviously in absolute basis.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

We don't manage the company on a market share basis, as you know. We just put out
there our pricing and see what the market gives us after a quarter, but you're quite right,
with the new black box environment, it's a lot harder to see where everything falls out and
I think we're not the only ones. I think most of our competitors will feel the same way. And
we're still in the early innings of how they deploy their pricing modules, how the clients
react to theirs versus ours. So I will just see that we put our pricing up there with our return
and it so happens that we received and were able to write the amount of business that
we wrote in this quarter. I would not ascribe any market share target from where we sit.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is
open.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. My first question -- hey Marc, how are you? My first question is on your
pricing commentary. So in insurance, you said 3.5% price in the quarter, and so I'm trying
Page 7 of 19



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2019-10-30

to get a sense, I know there is a lot going on within that book and some new business as
well as your acquisition. But how do you guys view loss trend? I guess if you're getting 3.5
points of price, I would assume trend in aggregate is probably in excess of that. And can
you just kind of help us think through that a little bit better?

FINAL

A - Marc Grandisson

Yeah. The 3.5% for our portfolio, as you're pointing out rightfully, is that it's a very, very
diverse book of business. Some lines of business are still --as I said, it's not across the
board hardening market. Some lines of business are flattish and some are actually getting
way in excess of a 10%, 12% rate increase and some new business are getting quite a bit
above even a 5% or 6%, even if you're in the middle of the road. So I would just have you
thinking about, the starting point is also pretty important. So it's not -- the 3.5% is one
number that attempts to encapsulate everything and it works well when you have a very
monolithic marketplace or very monolithic book of business, but as you pointed our
market -- our business is very diverse. So I think that where you see growth is either
because we're seeing good opportunities in terms of good return, healthy returns,
regardless of the rate change. And if we have a rate change and a growing opportunities
because then the rate change is clearly beating the loss trend. We always look for margin
of safety. We are looking at rate change and claims loss trend and it's not a game of
decimal.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. And then a lot of new business, right, I think you guys said three quarters of the
insurance growth with some new business this quarter. So I guess, as we think about,
you're getting good price on that you said better than renewal, but I would assume you're
probably setting the loss picks a little bit higher than where the legacy Arch business
would be. So how do we think about kind of the ongoing margin profile of the insurance
book, right, and like bringing on this new business and the goal, I think, to get down
towards that mid-90s underlying margin?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yeah. I think if we -- if you look at the way we react to the marketplace acquiring business
that gives us good return and good margin because -- and it doesn't have to be because
of rate change, it may just be because of wanting to find a new home because of risk
appetite of other players are such that business finds its way to our balance sheet. This
has one aspect or whether the rate is going up. I think that we have a very, very
straightforward actuarial method to look at where we were assuming the loss trend and
the rate change and we booked that appropriately and I would argue conservatively so
that we don't have surprises or we actually have enough room to maneuver going
forward, but broadly speaking, margin is expanding as we speak on business that we
write in this segment in this time, this point in time.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. That's helpful. And then my last, just a numbers question. I think the last time you
guys updated us mortgage earnings were about within the ballpark, I think, like 75%. Is
that still kind of about the right level or maybe it's gone a little bit higher this year?

Page 8 of 19

FINAL

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

Well, yes, it's definitely higher this year because mortgage has done phenomenally well
and we've got some cash on the P&C side. We're -- as the P&C market, I think, is
improving slightly over the last few quarters and hopefully there is more room to grow,
we'd like to think that the P&C earnings are going to start growing as a proportion of the
total and mortgage will be a bit less so. I mean, mortgage we still think has a lot of runway
in it as well, but just I think we can see more earnings coming through the P&C segments
and that should help balance it out a little bit more.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks for the color.

Good morning everybody.

Good morning.

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

Good morning.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Two questions. One P&C related and one mortgage-related. On the P&C side, obviously
the growth is very strong in the quarter. Can we foresee and when can we foresee it a
reduction in the expense ratio based on amortizing a larger premium base across a
similarly-sized cost structure?

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

Yeah, Josh. I think we don't like to have -- make forecast, but I think it's realistic to see or
think that sometime in 2020 as we earn some of the premium that we, again, the UK
regional book that will filter in and second half of 2020 like to think that maybe we should
see some improvement. Everything else being equal, I think that's kind of what we're
thinking about. You guys have heard it, we said it before, we are still -- we still have a
target to achieve a 95 combined ratio. That we're now committed [ph] to win, whether
that's a year, two years, five years down the road, we're making the right improvements
Page 9 of 19



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td

along the way, but we certainly at least in the interim and over the next 12 to 15, 18 months
like to think we're going to see some improvement coming through on the combined
ratio.

FINAL

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Great. Thank you. And then (inaudible) expense ratio, obviously the loss ratio is up to the
underwriting of course.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Correct.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Then on the mortgage side, obviously a lot of the new insurance written in the quarter,
but a very high proportion came from refi and contracts with LTV lower than 85%. Can you
talk a little about that new business, whether it has persistency to it, whether a little
housing appreciation somebody takes that business off your books. How should we think
about the growth in the core specifically and how it differs from prior quarters?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Well, the growth -- the overall market is getting better and you're quite right. The
purchasing is actually growing, despite the -- if you look at the projection for the NBA for
over next couple of years, the growth in mortgage origination is still there in the purchase
market. The refinancing was not a surprise, but it's a reaction to the drop in mortgage
rate by about 110 bps over the last 12 months and that's to be expected. So we have this - I wouldn't say flurry, but we had this heightened activity of refinancing that is occurring.
And the reason that the refinancing is still a big, I would say, like a bigger proportion with
MI attached to it is, a lot of it was originated recently and they still haven't crossed the LTV
below 80%. So it allows us actually to go back again to the same client and re-up our
mortgage insurance offering to them. That's it.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Is that refi business more profitable on a risk adjusted basis because it's closer to getting
to a point where there's a lower risk that needs MI or is it lower risk because it has a lower
persistency because it's close to getting below 80%? I mean, how should we think about
that business versus the rest of the box, I guess?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

So risk-wise, it's a little bit -- it's about the same risk wise. It's the same goes to the same
process of evaluating. I think there is pricing, it's a little bit less pricing and a lot of it has to
do with, it's sort of rolling forward the same book of business, it's like a renewal book of
business. So I would say it's slightly less, but I think risk adjusted, they're very, very similar
after you factor everything else.

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}
Page 10 of 19

And are these customers likely the same customers you've had before or -- because of
your procurement skills or is the mix change that depends on who picks it up -- the
crapshoot you get that refi from a previous customer?

FINAL

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

I think you can make some action points to try and protect our book of business, but the
latter is more likely, if you don't do anything. I think it just got thrown back, it's thrown back
into the pool, it may be refinanced by a different mortgage originator to begin with. So
that will have different relationships going along with that.

Well, the way we look at it, it varies obviously by layer or some of the old Bellamy's of
amortized, but big picture, Geoff, I mean, you should think about roughly 3% of the

mezz cover and now we're really looking at mezz plus cat cover. Can you talk about the
decision to do that? The market reception for continuing to do that going forward and
how you weigh the risk benefit versus cost?

FINAL

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Right. Well, certainly initially the attach and detach structures were very much focused on
PMI or coverage and capital requirements. I want to say in the last year, we've moved a
little bit, like you said, beyond that. There is a bit more of a focus with rating agencies that
have slightly different views on capital requirements. So we're always interested in the
trade-off and making sure that, yes, maybe we can get some additional protection at a
rate or at a cost that is efficient for us, and that's part of our capital management
decisions. So it's --that's how we look at it and I think part of your question there is
tremendous appetite in the investment community for these types of products, as you
know, and the fact that we're expanding the programs a little bit and going up a bit more
into the, like you said, past the mezzanine layers of risk, we've had tremendous success in
placing those instruments and we think they're hopefully there for us down the road.

Q - Geoff Dunn

{BIO 3447798 <GO>}

Okay. And then just quick last follow-up. The other IIF was basically flat sequentially. Is that
just lapse rate experience or are you seeing any change in the attractiveness of the GSE
CRT market?

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

It's just a normal roll-off, Geoff, of -- as you know, we've been added since 2014. So you
would have a sort of a seasoning and so getting sort of a run rate in terms of appetite
and having frankly our allocation being more stabilizing with the last two, three years.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Your line
is open.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. I guess my main question is just around the premium growth in
insurance and reinsurance. Seeing some growth in longer tail lines and I think you even
explicitly talked about a multi-year program that you signed and multi-year treaty signed in
casualty reinsurance. Just given the loss trends that we're hearing about and just kind of

increased concerns around deterioration thereof, can you maybe tell us or talk us through
how you gain comfort and growing those lines here?

FINAL

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yeah. That transaction is very unusual. And I would call -- I would put in a camp of a bit
more opportunistic in nature. Not that we don't want to renew it for the foreseeable
future, but this is -- this came to us with a lot of deep changes through the pricing, the
attachment point and whatnot. So it's not that you renew the same structure necessarily
you are on. So there is a lot of moving parts to that transaction. That one would be
squarely in the camp of tremendous distress, which you said in your comments, Francois,
and definitely at a heightened level of return that we believe more than covers any of the
range of outcome or potential outcome on the loss trend going forward. So it's about
margin of safety here.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Okay. And that's specific transaction and then more broadly, the other growth in programs
construction, (inaudible) surplus casualty?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Very similar. I mean, the construction in national accounts would have a bit more workers'
comp. So we have a bit more view in the loss trend in there. So that helps in our loss picks.
On the E&S casualty, I think you would have a very similar phenomenon, not to the same
sort of distressed level that I've just mentioned in the reinsurance transaction. But
certainly, you have similar overtones of distress being pushed in toward the different
marketplace and having to be repriced and at price level that we believe far make up for
any uncertainty, we may have in terms of loss trend.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Got it. And then maybe more broadly, as you're looking at deploying capital into insurance
or reinsurance, when you think of quota share reinsurance here, getting the benefit of
improving underlying conditions and then maybe additional improvement on the
reinsurance side, does that start to become more attractive than the insurance book?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

I think the reinsurance playbook is a little bit different. I think you have -- you can, by a
strike of a pen, embark on a significant partnership with a ceding company under
reinsurance that really moves the needle quickly as we saw in that transaction I just
mentioned. On the insurance, it's a slower build, but I think if you look back at our 20022003 history, the reinsurance team is a lot quicker because -- and has the ability to be
much quicker and get access to business that's going through a rate change and
improvement, rather much quicker than our insurance group will, but the insurance group
is not far behind, as you saw, in the numbers this quarter. So that's more of the same
playbook, Yaron.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Meredith from UBS. Your line is open.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Hey, thanks. A couple of questions here. First, I'm just curious, on the big transaction,
reinsurance transaction, did it distort any of the ratios? And also was there any unearned
premium portfolio that came with it, which would have maybe played in the earned
premium?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

No, it's early. So there is no LPT, there is no incoming port in. So it's a grade-up multi-year
deal, and then distorted the ratio, not really. So there is normal level of, it's loss ratio,
expense ratio, it's been -- not a whole lot has been earned as it is. So it really -- in the big
picture for the segment, there is no impact at this point.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great. Thanks. And then just curious, in the insurance segment, some of the investments
that you're making that you highlighted claims etcetera, etcetera, how long are those
expected to continue here for? And maybe another way to think about it is, if I look at
your other underwriting expenses kind of growth that you're seeing, how much of that is
due to the acquisition versus just investments you are making?

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

I'd say, roughly speaking, there is probably a good -- I mean, more than half, maybe twothirds is from the acquisition that we made. So we brought on the fair amount of people
with the acquisition. And as we said before, the earned premium has to earn and we think
that by early 2020 that that portfolio will have been fully with us for a full year.
And then on top of that, there is still a few more adjustments or investments we made in
terms of staff. We brought in some underwriters that help supplement some of the lines
of business where we are seeing opportunities and other small areas, like I had
mentioned, claims in IT where there's still investments we think are -- we're making that
are appropriate and at the right time for us to make them. I don't think those will keep
growing as much. So once the premium that we're putting on the books now earns out or
earns over the next 12 months, it should stabilize and level out and maybe even go down
a little bit.

Great. And then another question. If I look at some of the growth that you guys are
putting on excluding this big multi-year kind of treaty came on, a lot of it's heading more
towards property, kind of property cat, businesses that tend to be a little bit more volatile.
Is that something we should expect perhaps going forward a little more volatility in the
results, but maybe lower underlying combined ratio as kind of a shift kind of mix of
business?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

The property that we are growing in leaps and bounds is actually not necessarily -- some
of it is cat exposed on the insurance side, but there is a cat cover and reinsurance
protections against the volatility of the results. On the reinsurance side, I think most of the
property growth is actually not necessarily cat exposed. So it's a bit of a different growth.
Some of the cat exposed, you've seen some cat and the premium written growing,
although we would say we are relatively under-weighed, exactly, very small compared to
what you would expect (inaudible) our size. So no, we don't expect much more volatility as
a result of that.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Great. And then my last question, I'm just curious, as we look at this kind of terrific growth
you guys are putting on in the insurance and the reinsurance area, I'm just curious how
fungible was the capital between your mortgage insurance business and your insurance
and reinsurance business? Is it easy to take money out of the MI operations, maybe fund
growth in the insurance or reinsurance, how does that all work?

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

Well, it's not 100% fungible, but maybe you noticed in our numbers this quarter, the
PMIERs ratio went down in the third quarter as a result of a fairly substantial dividend that
was upstream from the US MI operations to the group. So that is money that is available
to fund growth in both the insurance and all our other lines of business or segments. So
how easy is it to do? It's a process. It's not -- certainly you can't do it on a whim or just
overnight, but once we get the regulatory approvals and we sit down with them and show
them scenarios and stress scenarios and forecasts and certainly figuring out also
contingency reserves, so there is a lot of statutory rules we have to abide with, but big
picture, we have the ability to use some of that capital and move it around, then use it in
other areas.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Great. Thanks. I only had one question. Marc, I was hoping you can help us understand
how to think about the expenses associated with the submission flow uptick in P&C.

FINAL

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yeah, it's more expensive and I think that one of the investments that we talk about is to
get much more efficient in dealing with those submissions and being more proactive,
using tools such as predictive analytics to really get to the one that we have a higher
chance of hitting. So this is certainly part of, yes, absolutely to the point that we're
investing to be able to augment the throughput on the platform. That's one of them.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. In general, do the -- distribution, I'm trying to figure out a way to ask this. Are more
of the -- as a percentage, are more of the submissions priced adequately now or is there
enough disruption in the marketplace that you're seeing or -- that agents are pitching that
it just doesn't make sense to you -- to Arch right now?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

So right now we're seeing more submissions coming to us. Our hit ratio is not -- it's still in
its early stages of finding its footing. It's also reactive to the market place price. So -- but
clearly, we are finding, in the new business, similar and possibly in a growing mode, more
of our liking as to what's being proposed in the marketplace. By virtue of the fact that that
business is not put out in the E&S market for pricing or for consideration tells you that it
will be most likely repriced.
The problem that we have with this, as you could appreciate it, it doesn't mean it's
repriced. It's priced adequately, right. It could come out of a place where it needs
probably a 30% increase to get to this E&S, thrown into the marketplace, and only come
in at 10.15 or go for 10.15. That's not enough for us to do. So it's still very important to be
selective in what we do and maintain, as we have, our underwriting discipline.

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Hi, thanks a lot. I had a question about Watford. It's obviously trading at a huge discount to
book. And it sort of indicates sort of a disbelief from my view, a disbelief in either the
underwriting quality or the investment portfolio or strategy, and -- not that I subscribe to it,
but at least the markets seem to subscribe to sort of one of those two justifications. What
are Arch's thoughts about where it sits stock price-wise and the plan and maybe the use
of capital at Arch to remedy it, if you're self-motivated? Obviously, there has been some
personal investment sizable the last few months by Arch executives, but beyond that,
would you comment, please?

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

Yeah, I'll start and I'm sure Marc will chime in. I think at a high level, certainly, there is only
so much we can say, but we're still very committed to the Watford platform. It's been
good for us. I think it gives us the ability to access business in a different way that we
wouldn't be able to do just with Arch. In terms of stock price, who knows what the market
is thinking. I would argue that maybe there is overreaction based on some of the other
hedge fund reinsurers and how they perform. So I wouldn't speculate or think that where
it's going to go, but I -- my personal belief is it's probably a bit -- there's some
overreaction going on. So Marc, anything you want to add?

Bloomberg Transcript

I think the one thing I would add, Ron, to this is, I'm still in and I feel like the company's
perspective and I would even argue that it's even better at this point in time. I think that
the marketplace is getting better. And Watford is uniquely positioned to be side by side
with us and as we underwrite and help them write good business on the book. So I'm
actually more positive, if anything, today than I was six months ago, which I was already
positive to begin with. There you go.

Cook collapsing. Could you maybe give a breakdown of how much of an impact the large
losses had on the underlying results there?

FINAL

A - Francois Morin

{BIO 17410715 <GO>}

Yeah. I mean, it's not major. I think I just made the point to let -- have you guys think about
it so that it can happen. These things happen. This quarter was Thomas Cook. It could
have been something else, it's been other things in the past, we've had property fac
losses. So it's not out of norm. It's -- right now I think it's around a 3% impact on the loss
ratio this quarter. That's what we're in the business of doing. We insure, I mean, we are in
the risk business and we're not making excuses. We're just -- let you know, we're just -- I
mean, it's very consistent what we've seen in the past and highlighting it. So that's all I
think we want to say now.

Q - Crystal Lu

{BIO 20855689 <GO>}

Okay. That's helpful. And then one more question on just getting the insurance
profitability down to your 95% target eventually. How has the changing pricing
environment changed your view on your internal timeline and strategy in terms of
business mix there?

A - Marc Grandisson
