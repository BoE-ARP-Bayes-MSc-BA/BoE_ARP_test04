Presentation
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the conference call for the 2012 nine months' results. I
am pleased to introduce Bart De Smet, CEO; and Christophe Boizard, CFO. (operator
instructions) And I will now give the floor to Bart De Smet.

Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. and thank you, all, for dialing in to this
conference call, and for taking the time to go through the nine months 2012 results
presentation of Ageas.
As usual, I'm joined in the room by my colleagues of the Executive Committee,
Christophe Boizard and Kurt De Schepper; our Investor Relations and Finance Teams; and
also Antonio Cano, CEO of AG Insurance has joined us.
Together with Christophe, I will take you briefly through the main highlights of the past
nine months, after which we have allowed sufficient time for questions.
Ladies and gentlemen. in line with our results at the end of June, we can announce the
strong performance for the past nine months, with another robust Third Quarter across all
the Insurance business segments. The results are in happy contrast with those of last year,

as the nine months 2011 results was heavily impacted by massive impairments of Greek
debt and equities.

FINAL

Adjusting the nine-month results, both for this year as well as last year, for impairments
and realized capital gains, the net Insurance results improved about 25% compared to last
year. Let us go somewhat deeper into the key figures.
The inflows in the first nine months amounted to EUR15.5 billion, up 20% both in Life and
Non-Life, and helped slightly by a positive currency impact.
The inflows in the Third Quarter amounted to EUR4.6 billion, an increase of 20%
compared to last year. In contrast to previous quarters, growth slowed down somewhat
across all segments, with the exception of Asia.
Overall, however, volumes remain good, with the highest increase still coming from
Continental Europe, where inflows were up by some 40% year on year, which was mainly
the result of a change of scope in Luxembourg, and the acquisition in Turkey.

Bloomberg Transcript

In Asia, a continued focus on recurring premiums and persistency resulted in strong
growth in regular premiums, especially in China and Thailand. Today, regular premiums in
Asia already represent over 70% of total business. Our non-consolidated partnerships
represented EUR7.3 billion over the first nine months.
Our year-to-date Insurance net profit amounted to EUR450 million, compared to a net
loss of EUR209 million last year. On slide five of the presentation, you will find a clear
overview of the impairments and capital gains.
As you will certainly remember, last year's result was impacted by a total impairment
charge of EUR615 million, related to the Greek sovereign exposure and equities. Whereas
this year's results suffered from total impairments of EUR57 million, almost all related to
equities.
Realized capital gains on equities and fixed income amounted to EUR92 million this year
and EUR72 million last year. Adjusting the results for all these elements, the net result
amounted to EUR414 million this year, compared to EUR334 million last year, up about
25% compared to last year.
The net reported result breaks down as follows. EUR293 million in Life; EUR143 million in
Non-Life; and EUR13 million in Other. The performance in Non-Life remains strong. The net
result increased from EUR57 million last year, to EUR143 million this year. And if we exclude
the impairments and capital gains over both years, the net result doubled.
The continued progress that we recorded in Belgium and the UK, but also the good
results in Continental Europe, doubled the profits year to date.

FINAL

The overall combined ratio remains strong at 97.9%, with another solid performance in the
past quarter at 97.2%. Both in Belgium and UK, the combined ratio stayed well below
100%, with Motor, in particular, continuing to produce excellent results. In addition, Fire
improved substantially, with a combined ratio of 97.1%.
In our smaller, but steadily growing, Non-Life markets of Continental Europe and Asia, the
underlying ratios were even better. In both Belgium and UK, the net result in Non-Life was
supported by realized capital gains, although largely offsetting Belgium by the previously
mentioned impairments of equities, but also an adjustment reserves for bodily injuries.
The prior year releases, year to date, amounted to 3.8%, compared to 3.2% last year.
The Life activities contributed EUR293 million, compared to a net loss of EUR289 million
last year. Adjusting the results once again for impairments and realized capital gains, we
see an improvement of some EUR50 million, or about 22% largely thanks to our Asian
activities.
There, we have seen strong organic growth, helped also by a few positive non-recurring
items, mainly in the first half of the year. In Belgium, the underlying performance also
improved, driven by better operating margins.

Bloomberg Transcript

And finally, the segment Other, recorded a result of EUR13 million, compared to EUR23
million last year. It is important to note that last year's result included an incentive payment
from a commercial partner of EUR6 million and this year's result included a EUR2 million
restructuring cost related to Kwik-Fit, but also the impact of a highly competitive
environment.
At a Group level, our net profit amounted to EUR518 million, with a net profit in General
Account of EUR69 million and a net Insurance result, as already mentioned, of EUR450
million.
Year to date, we see a total impact of the legacies of EUR140 million positive, which
included, in Third Quarter, a positive revaluation of the call option on the BNP Paribas
shares, amounting to EUR57 million.
And finally, the shareholders' equity increased substantially to EUR9.7 billion, but this is
largely thanks to the Group profit and also as a result of increased unrealized gains. The
solvency remained strong at 214%, while the net cash position amounted to EUR1.4 billion.
And before turning to Q&As, I would like to ask our CFO, Christophe Boizard, to share a
number of high-level comments by business and on the General Account.

Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Thank you, Bart. Now let's take a look on the financial performance of the different
segments. All the amounts will be in euro.

Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V

Date: 2012-11-07

Let's start with Belgium, where inflows amounted to EUR5 billion and were up by 10% (sic;
see press release), compared to last year, a comparable growth number as at the end of
June.

FINAL

Inflows increased both in Life and Non-Life. In Life, we have seen strong sales in individual
savings, especially via the bank channel, but also in group life.
Important to mention here is that guaranteed interest rates on new individual life contract
was decreased to 2% in August, reflecting lower interest rates that are recorded on the
financial markets. In group life, a reduction has been announced as of January 1, 2013.
Operating margins improved both in Life and Non-Life, with a better investment margin in
Life; and, in Non-Life, a better underwriting margin. The latter followed the improved
combined ratio, which amounted year to date to 98.8% and to 96.9% for Q3 alone, which
is a very good performance.
All businesses did well, but fire, property, if you want, deserves a particular mention at
84.7%, which is even better. In the United Kingdom, Non-Life gross written premium, year
to date, amount to EUR1.6 billion. Growth in motor remains good, but was offset by lower
premium levels in household and travel.

Bloomberg Transcript

Net profit in Non-Life almost doubled to EUR73 million, driven by the continued good
performance in motor, but also, thanks to a realized capital gain of EUR14 million. This
more than offset higher weather-related claims in household.
Like in Belgium, the combined ratio remained substantially below 100% at 98.6% and here
again, motor fueled this performance with a combined ratio of 96.7%.
In our Life protection business, we have recorded the first-ever quarterly net profit fully in
line with its stage of development. On the other retail business, commissions and fees
were in line with last year's level and above EUR200 million.
Net profit for the first nine months amounted to EUR13 million with EUR5.4 million net
profit in the Third Quarter. As Bart already mentioned, this result includes a restructuring
provision related to Kwik-Fit financial services and last year's results benefited from an
incentive payment.
This brings me to Continental Europe where inflow, as already mentioned in Bart's
presentation, increased by 40% to EUR2.9 billion. However, most of the growth relates to
scope changes with the new merged entity in Luxembourg accounting for EUR1.3 billion,
while Turkey, which is the second element of restatement, contribute to EUR431 million of
gross written premium.
The net profit in Continental Europe amounted to EUR49 million, with a solid Non-Life
contribution to net result of EUR13 million, reflecting a satisfactory combined ratio of
89.9%.
Page 4 of 24



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2012-11-07

The Life net result improved somewhat on an adjusted basis, with lower claims in the risk
business and lower costs. Operating costs are well under control and down year on year
by 11%.

FINAL

Finally, Asia; as already indicated, this segment continued the excellent momentum of the
first half, with inflow of nearly EUR6 billion, 25% up on last year, of which 12% related to
positive currency impact.
The regular premium book continued to grow and already counted for EUR3.8 billion out
of EUR5.3 billion of Life premium. Life operations contributed an excellent EUR92 million
(sic; see slide 38 "EUR93 million") to the net Insurance profit or 20% of the total net profit
of the Group.
Strong underlying growth, some positive currency impact and a few non-recurring items,
mainly in China and Hong Kong, explain this overall excellent result.
In Non-Life, the net result remained below last year at EUR6 million and suffered, as you
will remember, from additional Thai flood losses booked in the first half of the year.

Bloomberg Transcript

And to end my presentation, a couple of words on the General Account. We reported a
net profit of EUR69 million for the first nine months, of which EUR67 million in the Third
Quarter. The Third Quarter result was largely driven by the positive revaluation of the call
option BNP Paribas. At the end of September, the value of the call option amounted to
EUR174 million.
The value of the equity investment in Royal Park Investments increased slightly, to EUR864
million. For the first nine months, RPI generated a net result at 100% before a goodwill
impairment of EUR707 million; and redeemed about EUR1 billion of debt.
At the same time, and based on the quarterly review of the fair value and the value in
use, we had to further impair goodwill by about EUR506 million year to date. And I will
remind you that, in that case, when we impair goodwill, that's not bad news, if, during the
Q&A, I can elaborate a little bit more on this.
As a result, on the EUR276 million of the original EUR2.3 billion goodwill remains; which
means that if the market valuation of the portfolio follows the same trend in Q4, we could
expend the full -- the complete impairment of the goodwill by the end of the year.
Total staff and other administrative expenses are fairly stable, compared to last year.
As Bart already mentioned, the net cash position in the General account didn't change a
lot compared to the end of June, and amounted to EUR1.4 billion.
At the end of September, we already spent EUR52 million on the EUR200 million share
buyback program announced early in August. And you will have seen in the press release

Page 5 of 24



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2012-11-07

that most of the figure is about EUR91 million. So EUR91 million compared to the EUR52
million we had at the end of Q3.

FINAL

Ladies and gentlemen. let me end this short introduction on the results with a few
comments on the investment portfolio.
The fair value of our investment portfolio increased by roughly 10% since the end of 2011,
to EUR65.6 billion. This increase is driven by volume growth in existing business; new
business; and, of course, also, thanks to the yield drop on European bonds.
Unrealized gains and losses on the total investment portfolio in available for sale more
than tripled, to EUR5.5 billion, with unrealized gains on fixed income up to EUR4 billion.
And on the top of this, we have EUR1.4 billion coming from real estate, which are not
reported in the shareholder equity. Because you will remember that, in our accounts, the
real estate is accounted at -- is not at fair value.
So we have this EUR1.4 billion on the top of what we have in the account. So EUR4 billion
plus the EUR1.4 billion, and you have most of the EUR5.5 billion.

Bloomberg Transcript

Here, the difference is given by equity. We have EUR143 million (sic; see slide 41 "EUR142
million") of unrealized gains on equity. I wanted to mention this because it means that on
the equity portfolio, after all the impairments we have booked, we have now unrealized
capital gain in our portfolio.
Within the framework of the recently announced initiative to finance infrastructure
projects, Ageas selected, during the Third Quarter, five projects, for a potential total
amount of EUR221 million. And among these five projects, four are coming from the
partnership with Natixis.
Ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to end my comments here, and hand over to Frank.

Frank Vandenborre

{BIO 15168443 <GO>}

Thank you, Christophe. Ladies and gentlemen. this concludes the short introduction. I
would like now to open the line for questions. As usual, we would propose that you limit
yourself to three questions max. And so, operator, please start the call for Q&As.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you, Mr. Vandenborre. So, ladies and gentlemen, this is the beginning of the Q&A
session. (Operator Instructions) JPMorgan, Ashik Musaddi.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

FINAL

Three questions. First of all, can you give us some color on the impact of low interest
rates on your Belgium earnings? Especially given that interest rates have gone down
significantly over the last four months, after your first-half results. So how do you see the
new money moving, and how do you see the impact of that on your overall recurring yield
on the total book?
The second thing is, can you give us some color on what's happening in the UK motor
market in the Third Quarter? Is the pricing going down, or is it going up or flat, or
something like that?
And third one is can you give us some more color on the trends in RPI in terms of
valuation of the asset? How much is it going up from economic recovery perspective? And
basically, when do you expect to get some dividend from RPI? Thank you.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. I will take the first and second question, and then hand over to Christophe for RPI.

Bloomberg Transcript

So if you look to the interest rates and the impact in Belgium, we should, as you indicate in
your question, separate two parts of the book. First of all, there is the book of business
from the past, where we -- and we already gave some indication on that during the
Investor Day in September, where we have a quite perfect matching; the duration
mismatch of this book of business was about minus 0.2 years.
Take into account the guarantees we offered in the past and also, guarantees we
contractually agreed on premiums still to come. And so in that book of business, you
could say, and I go for rounded figures, that we have some 4% yield for a guarantee that
is, over time, decreasing from, let's say, somewhere slightly above 3% to under 3%.
So you could say there, thanks to the whole restructuring of the investment portfolio, with
the moving out of the peripherals, replacing by Belgium and also some other changes in
the investment portfolio, we have taken the initiative to not be depending on these
changes in interest rates.
For the new business, of course, the investment yield we have on new business is lower,
let's say, also to use round figures, 3%-plus. And we took, of course, the actions to reduce
the guarantees. So as of November 1, the magnum rate in individual life has been reduced
to 1.75%. For a number of products, it's even 1.5% or 1.25%.
And in the group life business, where, for all these years behind us, the guaranteed rate
has been, in the whole industry, rather high at 3.25%, that also a decrease has been
announced, as mentioned also by Christophe, as of January 1, to 1.75%, for contracts
where you offer guarantees on future premiums if this guarantee of future premiums
does not[ph] reach 2.25%. So that's the situation in Belgium.

FINAL

The second question was about motor in the UK. So what we have seen, as far as we are
concerned, is that after two years of a rather important and huge price increases, 2012
has been much more flat on average.
So what we do is, of course, continually follow the evolutions in the market; try to price
competitively in the segments where we want to be. And in any case, we see that there is
some going away of prudency or of severity in adapting prices. But we still do not exclude
and even expect that there will be additional rate increases in the coming months and
quarters.
Christophe?

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you, Bart. So on the RPI, first, I'd like to give you some explanation about how it
works, the accounting, because I have to admit that it is not very intuitive. As a matter of
fact, it is very counterintuitive.
I said, during the -- my presentation, that this big goodwill impairment was good news,
and I'd like to give you more explanation about this. You will remember that, on the assets
side of RPI, the reference value for the asset is the recovery values.

Bloomberg Transcript

So it means that we are -- it's the value at which we expect to be reimbursed. So it means
that even when market valuation goes up, it doesn't mean that our final expectation goes
up.
So when you take the IFRS P&L, the first element is the change in market value, and these
go through P&L. But when it comes from the tightening of spread, it doesn't mean that
the recovery value will be higher.
And it's the reason why, in the valuation of the Company, at the end, we do the valuation
and we deduct the market value. And this gives us the amount of impairment we put on
the goodwill. So the fastest the market value goes up, the biggest the impairment is.
And as I said, the fact that we are close to the complete impairment of the goodwill is
good news because when we would have impaired with the goodwill at 100%, every
increase in market value will be a real increase in the wealth of the Company and this will
be booked in the P&L. So I hope that this explanation makes the RPI accounting clearer.
Now coming back more precisely on your question on dividend. It is true that taking into
account the good results of RPI, we as a shareholder would be willing to obtain some
dividend, but, unfortunately, among the three shareholders, the situations are quite
different. We are the only regular shareholder; whereas the two others are in a specific
situation and they are involved in the debt side of the balance sheet.

FINAL

If you take BNP Paribas, they are lender and they lend, at this moment, an amount of
about EUR500 million and the Belgian states gives its guarantee on the commercial paper
program.
So it means that as soon as you pay a dividend, this dividend will be fund by additional
debt, with more commercial paper issuance, and this means that this payment of
dividend, theoretically, is an increase of risk. It's the reason why the two other
shareholders are a little bit reluctant at this moment, but we have ongoing discussion
about what loan to value would be acceptable for them.
I have good hopes that, in the coming months, we will reach an agreement. But to be
perfectly honest and transparent, for this year, we won't have a dividend; this is
postponed to next year at the soonest.

Thanks a lot, very helpful. Thank you.

Q - Albert Ploegh

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

I've got a few questions as well. First of all, in the press release, you mentioned that
compared to the first nine months last year, the underlying Insurance result was up around
25% when you take out the impairment charges and realized capital gains. What would be
the number if you also would adjust for acquisitions you've done over the same periods?
That's my first question.
Second one on Belgium Life. What is assumed in the results basically on profit sharing,
also to get a bit of feeling whether you may be a bit conservative? So actually, you're
basically overcharging for profit sharing that in the end might be lower.
And finally, also on the GIPS exposure to Southern Europe, you uploaded[ph] in the
quarter as there were some market opportunities; it's now EUR2.1 billion, I think, exposure
for the shareholder. Yes, what kind of level do you see as acceptable for a Group as
Ageas? Thank you.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

I propose to start with the second question, is the percentage of the profit share in
Belgium. Of course, what has been done is like all years; it's only at the end of the year
that the final or the real profit sharing decision is taken, while the full-year result is known.
But we have -- we usually, every quarter, provision what we believe might be the profit
sharing and this is something where we take into account, of course, decreasing interest

Page 9 of 24



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2012-11-07

rates where we have adjusted our profit sharing to such a level that we believe is more
than defendable towards policyholders and certainly acceptable also for the shareholders.

FINAL

Don't forget that over the last year, we have not given profit sharing to a lot of our clients
because the results were, as you know, rather negative in Life in the -- due to the
impairment on equities and on Greece. So the improvement of the investment margin has
been partly helped also by an adjustment downwards of the profit sharing provision.
The question on the reduction of investments in peripheral countries, I'll ask Kurt De
Schepper to give some color.

A - Kurt De Schepper

{BIO 6240700 <GO>}

Let me just remind you that we have our operations in Portugal and Italy, which imply that
we have a natural exposure to these countries. And that for the rest, when we look at the
Belgian situation, the Belgian company, that the investments that we have in the
peripherals, that they are becoming what I would call in an acceptable level.
We, of course, keep on monitoring the situation and might make use of some
opportunities but the need to reshuffle, as we experienced it in the past, I would call that
as over in the current circumstances within the market.

Bloomberg Transcript

That is for the peripherals. Bart, Christophe back to you.

Q - Albert Ploegh

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

Maybe one more question on the peripheral, the reduction. What was the loss rate more
or less in the P&L in Q3 from the reduction in the portfolio?

A - Kurt De Schepper

{BIO 6240700 <GO>}

It was -- I don't have the number here at hand, but it was not significant, it was a relatively
limited amount that we had there.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

No, in Q3, it was ex-revenue[ph] -- (inaudible) we sorted out the Greek position, but it was
a negligible amount of EUR12 million, you remember that is what remained at the end of
Q2, so let's say nothing.
And then we sold part of the Spanish position at an attractive spread, when the rates
were at 5.1%/5.2%, right after the announcement of the ECB program.
Then finally, the first question, we had -- I need some time to find. So compared to last
year, you could say that we have now a result of Turkey for approximately EUR4.6 million.
UK retail is similar to last year. It's some EUR23 million[ph] because in the segment,
although we have also retail costs. And Luxembourg is -- of course, we have a smaller
Page 10 of 24



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2012-11-07

stake in a bigger entity, but it's not -- so it was EUR3.5 million; now, it was EUR3.8 million
last year.

FINAL

So you could say the impact, if we compare, is about altogether a EUR4 million positive
because UK retail was already in it last year and the same for Luxembourg.

A - Kurt De Schepper

{BIO 6240700 <GO>}

So, all in all, these are negligible amounts.

Q - Albert Ploegh

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

Yes exactly. Okay, thanks very much.

Operator

Q - Robin Buckley

{BIO 3596512 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Just a couple of questions please. First of all, could you just comment on how your
accident year combined ratio has moved in the Third Quarter within the Belgium and the
UK operations? And just give some color over what has driven this?
And then secondly, I guess we're still seeing a reduction in the yield on the investment
portfolio for obvious reasons. But would you just be able to perhaps give a view as to how
you see the yield progressing over the future, just taking into account, I guess, some of
the changes in asset allocation that you have previously alluded to in terms of the
infrastructure loans.
And then the final question is just related to the Asian Life business. And I guess the
associates line that we see coming through there that I guess can be quite volatile quarter
to quarter; could you perhaps just give some guidance in terms of how we should expect
profitability on that to progress over the next couple of years? Thank you, very much.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay, the combined ratio evolution in Belgium and UK, so the combined ratio in the Third
Quarter was 96.9%, after 95.6% in the Q2, 104% in Q1. So 104% was mainly impacted by
wet weather in Non-Life, where we were at that moment at 118% combined with fire,
where it was 84.7% in Q3.
So you see a rather stable combined in motor; very much improved in fire already Q2
because we were not really confronted with big weather events. And, of course, the
effect of the price increases there, you can say that if the rates in fire, in Belgium and
Greece, was almost 10%, that two-thirds of it is thanks to price increases.

Page 11 of 24



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2012-11-07

And then the third important business line is Workmen's Comp, where the combined,
that's gone from last year 190% to 104%. An extremely good First Quarter and a Second
Quarter that was worse. So First Quarter was 84%; second, 122%; and the third, 109%.

FINAL

But there, of course, in Workmen's Comp, a lot depends on a limited number of big
claims. So that's a bit the situation in Belgium.
You can see that in -- normally, the results could have been better in motor, but there has
been an extra provisioning, as mentioned in the introduction by Christophe, for both the
injury where due to tables that are used in -- by the Belgium courts, there has been an
adjusted to lower interest rates, and this impact has been fully taken in Q3.
But you could say that the good evolution of the combined ratio in Belgium, the same
counts for the UK, it's fully on the account of all the actions that we've taken and a very
high focus of all the teams on establishing a combined ratio that is in line with our lowerterm targets.

Bloomberg Transcript

Therefore, the UK, there you could say that the Third Quarter has been a quarter of
98.2%, after 102% in the first and 96% in the second. This is rather good in motor, 98%,
95%, 97%. It is more volatile in fire with 112%, 97%, 95%, so there also, I think there has
been weather-related impacts. Net impact was EUR20 million more than last year and, as
mentioned also in the comments of Christophe, these have been partly offset by some
EUR40 million net cap gains. So, on a more normalized base, you could say the result of
as well Belgium as UK are really improving in Non-Life.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

And maybe one word on the fact that we slightly increased the technical reserve in motor
in Belgium because the expectation on bodily injury are higher than what we have in our
tables. So there is a one-off adjustment in negative. So this is a burden on the Q3
combined ratio.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

The question was on the yield performing.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

On the yield reduction, yes, I can take it. So on the yield, two things. First, if I take the
global return of the assets, obviously, it's very high; we are in excess of 10%. But most of
this accident figure comes from the change in unrealized capital gain. More interesting is
the yield without this effect. We are at around 3.8% on the first nine months.
Then my comment is that we are trying to diversify the assets. We have already
mentioned the partnership with Natixis, where I remind you that we expect something like
300 bps on top of the EURIBOR and as we will swap part of this position, what we expect
is a return in excess of 4%.

FINAL

Then, we have other initiative like investing in high-yield bonds. We have a big allocation
on real estate where expectations are at about 6%. So, all in all, we are trying to maintain
a decent level of investment return with all these initiatives.
As you can see, we are trying to slightly re-risk a little bit the balance sheet, but it is -- I
won't make any forecast for the future. So we will see first how quick the ramp-up period
is on the partnership. And if we invest in equity or not, so there is a lot of question mark
still, but we are actively working on this, you can imagine.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay, then we had -- the last question was on the results in Asia. So the volatility quarter
on quarter mainly comes from China. The results after nine months is nearly double from
last year.
What we see in Q3 is a much better result from Thailand versus last year. Of course, the
flooding back in the first two quarters is one of the elements for this. And the other
countries were still quite stable.

Bloomberg Transcript

So if you look to the -- what you call a bit the nonrecurring year to date overall in Asia, we
see that last year, after nine months, we had the net profit of EUR59 million, where you
could say adjusted for exceptionals was more EUR43 million. And this year, the net profit
we report after nine months is EUR92 million, where you could see it adjusted being
EUR71 million. And it is all Life. This is about Life.
So the large nonrecurring is coming from China where we had reserve release in the first
part of the year of, if I remember well, approximately some EUR15 million.
The net impact of cap gains is low; it was EUR2 million last year and EUR5 million this year
over the nine months.

Q - Matthias de Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

Three questions please. First, on the Belgium's technical results, these came down from
the previous quarter. What is explaining this sequential decline please?
Then on UK Non-Life, you mention that the bad weather conditions had an impact on
underwriting performance in the quarter. Could you shed some light on these specific
events, and possibly quantify the impact these had on the Third Quarter Non-Life
performance?

Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V

And then lastly, could you shed some light on the organic year-on-year evolution in Q3
gross written premiums please?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. The first was the technical results in Life in Belgium coming down. Looking to where
I find these figures, because I don't see them immediately.

Q - Matthias de Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

It's on page six of the press release.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Refer to our table, that's the easiest one that you go through. There is a page on
Belgium?

Q - Matthias de Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

Yes, it's page six in the press release, and the technical results were up to EUR79.4 million
from EUR93.7 million in Life at the end of -- over Q2, yes.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

I think that the -- I believe that the main reason is, putting aside the EUR23 million for the - no? Actually, Life, sorry. Sorry, I don't know, Antonio, whether you have -- well, a reason
could be that in Q2, but we will check it, that's, of course, the dividend season for the
shares in the portfolio, and that that has created an impact.
Another element is also that the profit sharing, that has been more stable over the three
quarters. But we'll check it, and come back to you. I don't have the answer I need at this
end.
The second question was the bad weather impact on underwriting in UK. There I try to
look to the detailed figures, where, okay, I think we've been impacted in the UK by
weather-related events all over the year. Looking again to the detailed figures.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

And you have in the detail.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

We have had a EUR29 million net impact. EUR8 million was in January; EUR10 million was in
February, so you could say the First Quarter was some EUR18.5 million; and then EUR10.5
million in Q2 June storms; and bad weather in Q3 was for EUR5.6 million.
That's the amount allocated to the four different moments, but it's, of course, not
excluded that part of the June storms has been booked in Q3.

Page 14 of 24



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V

And the third question was on the written premium. So what we -- we have, of course,
region by region, rather different profiles. If you look to Asia, as mentioned, we see the
impact of the proportion of regular premium going up.

FINAL

So it means year after year, certainly with the high retention, we have had a high
continuation of contracts with regular premiums. This will continue to support our organic
growth.
In Portugal, as mentioned, we have deliberately decided to bring almost to zero the
business in savings, due to non-profitability of these contracts in that market at this
moment.
And we try to keep pace with the unit-linked production where we see that this has been - has dropped last year, but we are more stable compared to last year in that line of
business.
And in Belgium, we must say that we have had, of course, in the first three quarters, each
time that the rate decreased, and there has been four rate increases, an additional fact of
this is that they have been written.

Bloomberg Transcript

You also have the contracts that are maturing, where 35% at minimum is reinvested. So
we are, of course, a bit less optimistic overall. Optimistic is maybe not the right word; we
don't expect continuous growth in Life in Belgium as we have seen over the past quarters,
and that's, of course, due to the fact that the interest rate decreased substantially.
And knowing that this line of business is the most difficult to get the returns we want to
achieve, it's a deliberate choice not to go for volume at any price in that product base.
But we still believe that our target, in the first place, is to increase the proportion of NonLife will help us also organically to increase our inflows in Non-Life. We expect, over time, a
lower evolution of the increase in the pure savings business.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

I think one interesting slide of the presentation is slide 20, where you have the inflow, our
share. So inflow, our share, if you take a look at slide 20, you can see that the increase is
12%.
If you take Asia, plus 26%, that's organic growth; there is no change in perimeters,
nothing. On Belgium, plus 10% organic growth as well.
So then the only resettlement that we could make are on Continental Europe, where
there is the effect of Luxembourg and Turkey, and then on the UK.
But at least on Asia and Belgium, that's organic growth, plus 26%, plus 10%, so I would say
that the rough estimation, organic growth should be close to 10%.

FINAL

Q - Hans Pluijgers

{BIO 16245530 <GO>}

A few questions from my side. First of all, on the Belgian inflows again, coming back, two
follow-up questions. First of all, on the group life, you said you gained some group life
contracts. But looking at the guarantee level, what's the profitability on those contracts? Is
it not a little bit lower, not some risk there?
And with respect to the inflow we've seen in Q2 and Q3, is there may be partially also a
result of an expectation of a reduction in guarantees. Or is there any impact let's say that
people who have already ramped up before to benefit from still higher guarantees?
Secondly, on the implementation of IAS 19, if it would be implemented today, what would
be your guesstimate impact on the equity side? Could you give some feeling there?
And lastly, respect to -- could you give some breakdown on the run-off gains by the main
markets; Belgium and especially UK, that are for me the most important ones?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay, question one, the inflows in Belgian group life contracts. So, first of all, the group
life contracts have a very important component which is risk, so mortality risk, disability
risk, which means that you have to look at them as a whole.
You could say that these contracts, even the contracts from the past with the almost
perfect magic we talked about, you -- we are in line with this target of 90 basis points
pretax margin.
The impact on new business, first of all, and I don't want to go in all the details, but in
Belgium, you have to know that the employer who contracts a group pension plan,
whether it's in a pension fund or a group insurance, he has to guarantee 3.25% on his
contributions and 3.75% on the personal contributions of the employees.
So it means with these rate decreases by AG Insurance and also other such[ph] insurers,
that an additional burden is on -- to be taken up by the employer. And this means that we
expect that new business will not be very successful in the coming period and it's also not
on the new business that we made our growth in the past.
The main growth is on existing plans and even in the single plans, they are always
negotiated with unions, so employers cannot stop them from one day to another. So we
expect that the current plans will continue to run and to grow.
Also, if an employer would, for instance, think about moving his plan to a competitor due
to this decrease of interest rates, he will, of course, get a lower guarantee elsewhere. So
Page 16 of 24



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2012-11-07

it's the same time an environment where the book of business is protected against
lapses.

FINAL

If, nevertheless, a client lapses, all these contracts have market-adjusted value, so then
the client goes away not with the accumulated results, but with the market value of the
underlying assets.
On IAS 19, that's a change in methodology. The impact will be limited and the order of
magnitude that I have in mind is around EUR20 million to EUR30 million.
Then the last question you have, is it possible to repeat it, because we're not sure that
we fully understood?

Q - Hans Pluijgers

{BIO 16245530 <GO>}

Yes, your run-off gains by your main operations, you've given the total number. If you
could give some feeling on what happened with the run-off gains, for example, in Belgium
and UK especially?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

You refer to release of provisions?

Q - Hans Pluijgers

{BIO 16245530 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

The prior years. Prior years. Sorry, prior years.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Yes. Okay, if you take -- as we mentioned, overall, it went up from 2.8% -- 2% -- 3.2% to
3.8%. That was Ageas as a whole. If we look to Belgium, give me one moment to find my
details.
Yes, it -- I give the series of prior-year releases since 2006. It was 7%, then 8%, then 4.2%,
then 8%, 6.8%, 7.3% and this year, it's 6%. So it's lower than last year but, of course, it's,
amongst others, also impacted by this additional strengthening of reserves that we did in
motor for these bodily injuries. So you could say it's not really overall a big change
compared to last year. It's even 1.3% lower.
If we then go to the UK, we will have maybe a bit different story. It was an NI of rolling
history as of 2010, 1.1%. In 2011, it was almost zero because then we strengthened in the
UK the reserves in fire insurance in the First Quarter of 2011. And this year, it is 1.8%
release. So you can say 1.8% compared to 1.1% two years ago, so also there, we don't see
a very -- a specific change.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

So it means that in the UK, reserves are close to best estimate on the safe side, but not
as -- with not a margin which is as big as it is in Belgium for instance.

FINAL

Francois Boissin, Exane BNP Paribas.

Q - Francois Boissin

{BIO 16045021 <GO>}

Two questions please; the first one on RPI. How should we think of the tax treatment of
your investment in RPI? How is the Company RPI taxed and how will dividends be taxed
when you upstream them to Ageas?
And your second question -- my second question sorry, is about the combined ratio.
You're quite lower than your guidance of 100% combined ratio. What is the outlook for
that in the coming quarters? Do you think that there are good reasons for the combined
ratio to go up with the pricing outlook, or basically how should we think of it?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So maybe I can start with the dividend on RPI. So if you read the statutory account of RPI
as the results, it has been positive for quite a while and now they are paid a dividend. So - and as a matter of fact, when you read the Belgium newspapers, you can read that RPI is
among the best tax payers. And I think, but on the top of my head, I am not 100% sure,
but they have paid something close to EUR400 million of tax, so that's a huge amount.
In case we will receive a dividend, it is tax free. So we won't pay a dividend -- we won't
pay tax on the dividend when we receive it.
Oh there is a reserve, the 5%, but it's a small amount. 5% on the dividend is taxed but as
it is received at the holding level and we have huge tax losses carried forward, at the end
we will pay zero.

Q - Francois Boissin

{BIO 16045021 <GO>}

Okay. But regarding the -- so, basically, regarding future profits that could be generated
at RPI, thanks to higher cash flows received than the outstanding debt payments, that
would be taxed, indeed, at a rate of what, 30-ish-%?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

At the level of RPI, yes.

Q - Francois Boissin

{BIO 16045021 <GO>}

So the effective tax rate is what, 35% or something like that?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}
Page 18 of 24



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2012-11-07

That's the full rate. 33.9%, that's the full rate.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

FINAL

The benefit from the notional interest deduction.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

And the benefit from the notional interest deduction, but basically, it's like a news or[ph] -yes, one-third is a good proxy.
Okay. Then the second question is our combined ratio is below 100%. I think our ambition
is to be structurally below 100% and, as mentioned also at the Investor Day, in an
environment with low interest rates, we will steer the teams and the operating
Companies towards a combined ratio so that's not just flirting with the 100% but that is.
In the area where we are today knowing, of course, that you always see that in Q1 and Q4
are the two quarters where you have some seasonality with weather impact, so we've
been -- as mentioned when I comment on Belgium, we've been lucky so far and hope
that it stays like this.

Bloomberg Transcript

But on the other side, we also have to repeat again that the combined even would have
been better if we would not have strengthened the reserves in Belgium for bodily injuries,
something where we can say we have already had this, which is not said for all
competitors necessarily.
So we, as in the call mentioned, we want to continue this momentum and we put a lot of
emphasis towards all the operating teams to keep this combined around the level we are
today.
And, of course, if there are opportunities for further improvement, we will not let them
pass. This is the fruit of the decisions we've taken over the past 1.5 years in terms of rate
increases, pruning of portfolios and changes in product design.

Q - Francois Boissin

{BIO 16045021 <GO>}

Yes. And in terms of outlook for the pricing, what can you say about Belgium and the UK?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

I'd say we follow the situation day by day, but maybe only one comment on that is that
looking to this strengthening that we did for bodily injuries, this is a new given, of course,.
And it will again be evaluated against the profitability of motor insurance whether this will
be -- have an impact on future pricing or not.
But at this moment, there are no real actions, global actions communicated. There is, of
course, a daily taking care of -- caretaking of pricing and due to the evolution we see in
the frequency and in the average claims.

And, Bart, I think we can claim the Belgian market due to our position of leader; we have
significant pricing power here, of course.

FINAL

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

And with the future closing that we expect before the end of the year of Groupama in the
UK, also there the market position will be considerably strengthened towards the top five
position, where also again, the capability to impact pricing increases fundamentally.

Two follow-up questions. First of all, on China, could you maybe elaborate a little bit what
you see going onward with respect to the inflow there has been very strong? What are
the main drivers and how do you compare to the market?
Secondly on that, do you expect, in the near future, any strengthening, or in maybe the
foreseeable future, a strengthening of the capital position there, so you will have to put in
some additional money there because of the strong growth[ph], could you give some
feeling there?
Secondly, respect to your joint venture with Tesco, are you already making the hurdles
there you have set for that joint venture? And could you give us some feeling what the
current returns are there?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. In China, we increased our market share compared to a year ago, from 3.2% to
3.4%. So we have noticed a growth of 10%, where the industry is plus-3.6%.
The split between regular premium and single premium is 75% regular, 25% single, so
also the evolution of inflow shows that a number of other competitors are much more
relying on single premium. And if you see that in the meantime, at the end of Q3, we
already have, out of EUR3.35 billion premium, already EUR2.5 billion is regular premium,
with a persistency ratio of above 90%. So this means this is our guarantee for future
growth.
Single premium is a surplus, but even if there would be a less -- a slowdown in single
premium business, where we in any case don't want to go the highest rates on the --

Page 20 of 24



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V

Date: 2012-11-07

impacting negatively profitability, so even if single premium business would come down a
bit, it will not stop us from growing further in inflows.

FINAL

The capital position, we have said, at a certain moment in time[ph], expected a need for
a capital injection in 2012. This is certainly not expected this year, but might be on the
table for 2013, in any case if growth grows on like this. And the ambition of the Company
is to further grow in the Chinese market.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

We can say that the new management have set a very ambitious objective in China, as
well. So we are expecting big growth.

Q - Hans Pluijgers

{BIO 16245530 <GO>}

Can you give me maybe some feeling on there on what kind of numbers you're thinking
then? Are you talking about EUR10 million, EUR20 million, or maybe some bigger amounts
for your side?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, it depends, because there are also other means if -- to strengthen the capital
position. It could be done with (inaudible), but I think this is something that we can only
determine in more detail when we have a clear view on the multiyear budget that we will,
together with them, work out in the coming months.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

There is no precise figure, because it was -- at the beginning, one year ago, it was
expected for this year. It has been delayed, so this has to be confirmed, the amount of
capital increase.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

And the GB Tesco, so we -- net profit for our share was EUR13 million for nine months, so
it means that we are close or above 11%.
Okay, we are very pleased with the way we work together with them and are hoping that
it's -- and are almost sure that it's also the case for them, because, like in all our
partnerships, we have very frequent contact with our partners, try to deliver and delivering
is the best mean to have a continuation of the cooperation.
Maybe make profit or make -- take the occasion to give some more details on the
question that we were not able to fully respond earlier in the call, was on the reason for
the decline in Q3 in the technical result for Life in Belgium.
So we referred already to potential impact of dividend. For -- to give an idea, in Q1,
dividend impact was EUR5 million; Q2, it was EUR23 million; in Q2 at EUR8 million. So the
difference between Q2 and Q3 is EUR15 million less dividend income.

FINAL

Q - Matthias de Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

One last question from my part. Your capitalization of certain insurance subsidiaries
significantly improved relative to the Second Quarter, for example, in Continental Europe.
Just wondered whether you see any opportunity to upstream capital out of certain
subsidiaries to the holding level, please?

A - Kurt De Schepper

{BIO 6240700 <GO>}

The situation in Portugal, in particular, profited from the improved valuation of the bond
portfolio and, hence, the capital position indeed improved.
You remember that we do not take into account any unrealized capital gains that would
be remaining after netting cap gains versus cap losses. But as unrealized cap losses went
away a little bit, the position improved.
It is too early, I think, that we would conclude on a upstream from Portugal, but, of course,
as you know, we always look at the optimization of our situation and, where possible, we
have dividends upstreaming.

Bloomberg Transcript

So it's too early days to make any firm assessment of that. We'll have to see how things
evolve over the next quarter and what the situation at that time will be.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

So we won't give you figures, but I think it is worth mentioning that we have clarified the
dividend policy of the Group with a subsidiary, and the Board has accepted a new policy
as soon as the capital position is above the target; 100% of result will be paid as a
dividend. And when you are slightly lower, you have different thresholds, with 50% or
zero, but things have been accepted and the Board has given positive advice on this new
capital and dividend policy.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

So it's not the dividend policy towards the shareholders there.

A - Kurt De Schepper

{BIO 6240700 <GO>}

No, it is the same for the (multiple speakers). But we will, indeed seek to finance a full
Ageas dividend to be determined later, early next year, by means of upstreaming from all
of the subsidiaries.

for the closing remarks.

FINAL

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay, ladies and gentlemen. thank you for your good questions. To end this call,
summarize maybe the main conclusions.
First of all, we believe it was a strong Third Quarter, which confirms the positive evolution
that we've seen in the first half. All the key performance indicators moved in the right
direction, and as already mentioned in the past, the challenge is to keep them there and
to further improve where possible.
Secondly, we outlined our vision for the future during our Investor Day held at the end of
September. We communicate a clear target that we would like to realize in 2015, but we
will, of course, update you on a regular basis on the progress made.
The acquisition of the Group on our UK activities fits well into these objectives, and will
have a positive impact on the weight of the Non-Life activities within Ageas.

Bloomberg Transcript

And with respect to the future, these results are very encouraging and we remain fully
focused on maintaining the momentum.
With that, I would like to bring this call to an end. Please do not hesitate to contact our
Investor Relations teams should you have outstanding questions.
Thank you for your time, and I would like to wish you a very nice day. Goodbye.
