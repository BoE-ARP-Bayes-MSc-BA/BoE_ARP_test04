FINAL

Well. Good afternoon to you. So good afternoon to everyone and welcome on this
conference call to discuss NN Group's results for the Third Quarter 2015.
I will begin today's presentation by looking at the highlights of the Third Quarter results
and the progress we have made to deliver on our strategic targets. Then Delﬁn Rueda,
our Chief Financial Oﬃcer, will talk you through the ﬁnancial details of the Third Quarter
results at a Group level and for the individual operating segments.
Then I will conclude the presentation with a wrap up, after which we will open the call up
for Q&A. And as customary, we also have our Chief Risk Oﬃcer, Doug Caldwell, with us
here to answer your questions. So let's go to slide number 3, the 3Q highlights.
NN Group is reporting a solid set of results for the Third Quarter of 2015. The operating
result of the ongoing business was up 43% on the Third Quarter of last year, at EUR392m.
This result was supported by a private equity dividend in Netherlands Life as well as a
good performance in Insurance Europe and Japan. And further cost reductions in the
Netherlands.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the other hand, our Dutch non-life business was hit by large weather-related and ﬁre
claims and lower results on prior accident years. And the results at our asset management
business are somewhat lagging behind as challenging market conditions have impacted
third-party ﬂows.
The net result was impacted by negative hedge results in the Japan closed block annuity
business following the high volatility on the global markets in the Third Quarter. The net
operating return on equity of the ongoing business of NN Group was 12.2% for the Third
Quarter of 2015, reﬂecting the improved proﬁtability.
Our IGD ratio increased in the Third Quarter to 322%, mainly driven by the tightening of
sovereign credit spreads in the Third Quarter net result. And our cash capital at the
holding company has remained stable at EUR1.6b.
Let's move to slide number 4. On this slide let me run through the three ﬁnancial targets
for NN Group as a whole.
Firstly, since 2013 we have reduced our cost base in the Netherlands by a total of
EUR201m. We have therefore achieved our original cost reduction target of EUR200
million earlier than planned. However, improving eﬃciency will remain a focus area,
especially in the Netherlands.
Secondly, we aim to realize an annual growth rate of the operating result before tax of the
ongoing business of 5% to 7% on average in the medium term. The operating result
before tax of the ongoing business for the ﬁrst nine months of 2015, of EUR1.184b,
represents a 43% increase compared with the same period last year.

This growth rate obviously reﬂects the particularly high results to date this year, which
were supported by some large favorable items. Given that this is a medium-term target,
we intend to measure our average growth rate over a longer period.

FINAL

Lastly, we aim to increase the net operating return on equity of the ongoing business in
the medium term, measured against the pro forma 7.1% for 2013. The net operating return
on equity of the ongoing business for the ﬁrst nine months of 2015 was 12%.
So let's move to the next slide, slide number 5. Aligned with the three targets on the
previous slide, we expect over time to generate free cash available to shareholders in a
range around the net operating result of the ongoing business. In 2014 the free cash ﬂow
adjusted for the IPO related items was EUR450m, compared with the net operating result
of EUR806m.
The free cash ﬂow at the holding company in the ﬁrst nine months of this year was just
over EUR1b, which included a total of almost EUR1.2 billion of dividends up-streamed by
our subsidiaries. This compares with a net operating result of the ongoing business for
the same period of EUR960m.

Bloomberg Transcript

As you can see, we are making progress. But please bear in mind that this is an over-time
target and there can be volatility in both the operating results and dividend ﬂow. Delﬁn
Rueda, our Chief Financial Oﬃcer, will go into details of our free cash ﬂow later in the
presentation. So let's move to slide number 6.
One of the main objectives of our equity story is to return excess capital to our
shareholders unless we can deploy that capital in other value-creating opportunities. We
have been delivering on that promise since the IPO through share buybacks and dividend
distributions.
In the ﬁrst half of 2015 we already completed two share buybacks and paid a ﬁnal
dividend over 2014. In the Third Quarter of this year we distributed the 2015 interim
dividend for a total amount of EUR156m, of which (EUR111m) in cash and the remainder in
newly-issued shares. We repurchased 1.7 million shares from ING to neutralize the dilutive
eﬀect of the stock dividend.
Also, in September we participated in the third sell-down of NN Group shares by ING and
repurchased 6 million ordinary shares for an aggregate amount of EUR150m. This
transaction further reduced ING Group's stake in NN Group to 25.8% of the outstanding
shares. Taking all these transactions together the total capital returned to shareholders
since the IPO amounts to almost EUR850m.
So let's turn to slide number 7. This slide shows the three pillars of our capital framework
and the key metrics that underpin our strong capital position.
The Solvency I capital ratio of our biggest unit, NN Life, increased to 299% at the end of
the Third Quarter of this year mainly as a result of the tightening of sovereign credit

FINAL

spreads and lower interest rates. Please note that NN Life paid another EUR125 million
dividend to NN Group in October this year and this is already reﬂected in its Solvency I
ratio.
Our holding company cash capital is stable, at EUR1.6b, as the free cash ﬂow that was
generated in the current quarter, mainly in the form of dividends received from our
subsidiaries, more or less oﬀset the amounts returned to shareholders in the form of the
2015 interim dividend and the share buyback in September.
In terms of ﬁnancial leverage our ﬁxed cost coverage ratio went up to 13.2 times. The
leverage ratio increased slightly, to 22.4%, while the gross ﬁnancial leverage position
remained stable, at EUR3.7b.
The IGD ratio increased to 322% at the end of the Third Quarter, driven by the tightening
of sovereign credit spreads and the Third Quarter net result. The 2015 interim dividend to
shareholders, of EUR156m, was already reﬂected in the IGD Solvency I ratio at the end of
the Second Quarter of 2015.
And with that I will pass the microphone to our Chief Financial Oﬃcer, Delﬁn Rueda, who
will take you through the ﬁnancial details of the Third Quarter 2015 results.

Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Thank you, Lard. Good afternoon, everyone. I will start with the consolidated results. NN
Group's operating result of the ongoing business, which exclude the closed block
valuable annuity business in Japan, was EUR392 million in the Third Quarter of 2015. This
is up 43% on the Third Quarter in 2014.
As Lard mentioned earlier, this increase was supported by a large dividend received
following the sale of a private equity investment in the Netherlands. Improved results at
Insurance Europe and the segment other also contributed to the increase, oﬀset by lower
results of Netherlands non-life and asset management.
In the right-hand chart you can see that the net result for the Third Quarter decreased to
EUR329m. This decrease was largely due to lower non-operating items and a negative
hedge-related result of Japan closed block VA.
Before going through the individual operating segments please turn to Slide 10, which
gives more detail on the cost savings in the Netherlands.
One of the ﬁnancial targets we set last year at the time of our IPO was to achieve an
absolute reduction of the administrative expenses in three segments, Netherlands life,
Netherlands non-life and at corporate and holding entities. That savings, of EUR200
million by 2016, were to be measured against the 2013 cost base.

Page 4 of 28



Company Name: NN Group NV
Company Ticker: NN NA Equity
Date: 2015-11-04

We have already achieved this overall cost-saving target. Cumulative cost savings to date
are EUR201m, of which EUR142 million was realized in 2014 and an additional EUR59
million in the ﬁrst nine months of the year.

FINAL

To reiterate what Lard said earlier, we remain focused on improving eﬃciency. We intend
to give an update on the evolution of our cost base at our capital markets day on
November 19.
Let's now look at the individual segments, starting, as usual, with Netherlands life. On
Slide 11 you can see the operating result of Netherlands life, which was EUR267 million in
the Third Quarter of 2014 (sic; see Slide 11 "2015"), up compared with the same period last
year.
There are several items driving this higher result. Firstly, the investment margin includes a
EUR110 million private equity dividend, whereas, the same period last year included
EUR20 million of private equity and ﬁxed income fund dividends. As you can see in the
far-right chart, the investment spread increased substantially, to 143 basis points in the
current quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

The technical margin was also higher as the addition to the unit-linked guarantee
provision following a decrease in interest rate was EUR7 million lower than in the Third
Quarter last year. In addition, the current quarter includes a EUR6 million release from a
provision from transferring liabilities to industry-wide pension funds.
On the other hand, fees and premium-based revenues decrease, reﬂecting the continuing
run oﬀ of the individual life closed book. And administrative expenses increase compared
with the Third Quarter of 2014.
However, please bear in mind that the Third Quarter of last year included the reallocation
of expenses to the segment other. Excluding this reallocation, administrative expenses
decrease by 1%.
I will now turn to Slide 12 for the results of Netherlands non-life. The operating result for
Netherlands non-life went down to EUR24 million from EUR32 million in the Third Quarter
of last year.
The current-quarter operating result was impacted by large weather-related and ﬁre
claims and lower results on prior accident years. This was partly compensated by a EUR17
million private equity dividend. Administrative expenses increased slightly due to higher
project expenses.
Looking brieﬂy at the two business lines within non-life we can see that the operating
result in disability and accident was higher. This was driven by the private equity dividend
already mentioned, which was partly oﬀset by less favorable claims development.

FINAL

The operating result in property and casualty continues to be under pressure. We saw
several large ﬁre claims again in the Third Quarter as well as lower results on prior
accident years in the motor portfolio, as well as in the miscellaneous portfolio, which
primarily comprises liability and legal aid cover.
We also had two severe summer storms in the Netherlands during the quarter and these
led to higher claims in both the ﬁre and motor portfolios. For non-life as a whole the
combined ratio increased to 105.6%.
Please turn now to Slide 13 and the results of Insurance Europe. Insurance Europe
reported a higher operating result compared with the same period last year, which
included EUR12 million of write oﬀs. Fees and premium-based revenues increased,
reﬂecting higher traditional life insurance premium across the region, as well as higher
fees on assets under management related to the pension business in several countries.
This was more than oﬀset by a decline in investment margin due to lower interest rates
under invested assets and a decrease in the technical margin.

Bloomberg Transcript

The improvement in the cost/income ratio is the result of lower administrative expenses.
New sales were lower, at EUR90m, due to product management actions to preserve
margins in the low interest rate environment.
Moving now to Japan Life, on the next slide, the operating result of Japan Life was
broadly stable, at EUR37 million for the Third Quarter of 2015. Please note that the
operating result for the Third Quarter last year included a EUR6 million beneﬁt in
administrative expenses due to a change in pension liability.
Fees and premium-based revenues increase almost 13%, driven by continuous strong
sales and larger in-force volumes. This was partly oﬀset by a decrease in investment
margin. The higher cost/income ratio is due to higher administrative expenses. Excluding
the impact of the EUR6 million pension liability beneﬁt last year the cost income would
have improved.
New sales were EUR143m, down 4.2% from the Third Quarter of 2014 at constant
currencies. This also reﬂects product management actions to preserve margins in the low
interest rate environment.
I will turn now to Slide 15 and the asset management segment. Total assets under
management decrease to EUR180 billion at the end of the Third Quarter of 2015,
reﬂecting total net outﬂows of EUR3.2 billion as well as negative market performance of
EUR1.3b. Assets under management are therefore back at the same level as at the end of
September last year.
The operating result decreased to EUR34 million compared with the Third Quarter of
2014, as increased fees were more than oﬀset by higher expenses. The increasing
expenses continues to reﬂect higher staﬀ-related cost following the strengthening of
Page 6 of 28

various investment and marketing teams, as well as higher market data cost due to the
appreciation of the US dollar against the euro.

FINAL

The segment other, which comprises the holding company, the reinsurance business and
NN Bank is set out on Slide 16. The total operating result of the segment other improved
from a loss of EUR33 million in the Third Quarter of 2014 to a loss of EUR23 million in the
Third Quarter of 2015. Let me go through the various elements within this segment.
The better holding result was driven by lower holding expenses. I already mentioned the
reallocation of expenses from the segment 'Netherlands life' to the segment other. That
happens in the Third Quarter of 2014. Even excluding this reallocation holding expenses
decrease by EUR8m.
At the reinsurance business the operating result was up due to better underwriting
results. Finally, the operating result of NN Bank increased, reﬂecting a higher interest
margin as the bank continues to grow its mortgage and savings activities. This was partly
oﬀset by higher administrative expenses, given the investments being made to support
this growth.

Bloomberg Transcript

I will now move to Slide 17 where we will cover our last segment, Japan closed block VA.
Japan closed block VA reported a loss before tax of EUR64m. This reﬂects negative
hedge-related results of EUR82 million following higher global market volatility in August
and September.
To help you understand the comparison with last year please keep in mind that the result
in the Third Quarter of 2014 included a reserve decrease of EUR63 million related to
higher lapse assumptions.
The portfolio continues to run oﬀ. The lower account value caused by a decreasing
number of policies is reﬂected in lower fees and premium-based revenues. The net
amount at risk increased to EUR379 million versus EUR76 million at the end of the
previous quarter, primarily as a result of equity markets' depreciation.
That completes the results of our operating segments. Now I would like to take you
through the movement in the holding company cash capital during the Third Quarter of
the year.
In the Third Quarter of 2015 free cash ﬂow at the holding company was EUR343m, which
is the sum of the three elements within the yellow box in the chart. As you can see, this
was mainly driven by dividends of EUR332 million received from our subsidiaries.
The capital ﬂows with shareholders, EUR306m, includes two items, the 2015 interim
dividend of EUR156 million paid in September and the EUR150 million share buyback
following our decision to participate in ING's sell down in September in order to return
excess capital to our shareholders.

During the Third Quarter we also acquired the remaining 20% stake in the Polish pension
fund from ING Bank Slaski for an amount of EUR31m. All together the cash capital position
of the holding company remained stable during the Third Quarter of 2015, at EUR1.6b.

FINAL

And with that I will pass you back to Lard.

Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Yes. Thanks, Delﬁn. Let me wrap up by saying, on page number 20 -- o slide number 20,
that we are pleased with another set of solid results for the Third Quarter of 2015.
Our capital position remains strong and this has allowed us to deliver on our equity story
of returning excess capital to our shareholders unless we can deploy that capital in other
value-creating opportunities. We continue to make good progress to achieve our
strategic ﬁnancial targets.
However, we are fully aware that there is still more work to do to further improve
performance within the business and, in particular, to reduce the combined ratio of our
Dutch non-life unit and to drive third-party inﬂows at our asset manager. Our entire
management team is fully focused on this while never losing sight of our primary
responsibility of delivering an excellent service to our customers.

And with that I would now like to open the call for your questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) In the interests of time we kindly ask each analyst to limit the
number of questions to two and your questions will be answered in the order in which
they are received.
(Operator Instructions) Cor Kluis, Rabobank.

Q - Cor Kluis

{BIO 3515446 <GO>}

Good afternoon, Cor Kluis, Rabobank. I've got a few questions. First of all, about the cash
ﬂow, especially the cash up-streaming, which has been quite material year to date, can
you give an idea of cash up-streaming we might expect for the Fourth Quarter? Can we
still expect something, or was this mostly it?
And also on cash ﬂow you up-streamed EUR332 million this quarter. You already
highlighted there the EUR125 million in July. Can you give the amounts of the other areas
where you up-streamed the capital from. And also related to that, of course, did you
upstream capital from the reinsurance business at the US -- the Japanese reinsurance
unit?

Page 8 of 28



Company Name: NN Group NV
Company Ticker: NN NA Equity
Date: 2015-11-04

And second question is about the combined ratio, which, yes, continues to be somewhat
elevated. Now there were prior-year eﬀects from motor and legal aid you probably are
not satisﬁed with the current results.

FINAL

Can you give an idea what you are currently -- or what you have been doing to really
structurally improve the non-life combined ratio towards the 97% going forward? Then,
yes, when will we see the structural eﬀects, positive eﬀects, from that?
And my last question is about Solvency II. You didn?t -- at least I haven't seen any
comments on that, maybe (in the) investor day. But is it still around the 200% so it's
basically unchanged guidance? (Those) were my questions.

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Okay, Cor. Good afternoon and thank you for your questions. This is Lard. I'm going to ask
Delﬁn to talk about the cash-ﬂow and capital-related questions and let me ﬁrst comment
on your comments and questions around the non-life company.

Bloomberg Transcript

Indeed, the Third Quarter of the non-life company was not a very successful quarter. We
did mention that it included some large incidental items like weather-related claims and
prior accident years, large ﬁre claims. These things are sometimes, of course, diﬃcult to
predict.
But you can't predict them. They just happen. They're summer storms. But having said
that, the -- we need to take, I think, a slightly longer perspective on how the development
is -- has been of the non-life company. So let me go, actually, portfolio by portfolio.
The ﬁrst one is the disability and accident business. If you take a year-to-date view on that
you -- then you'll end up in a combined ratio of 96.5% for the ﬁrst nine months of this year.
So if you look back on where that portfolio came from, where that business came from,
which was quite elevated in the last couple of years, I think we've got that under control.
And now we are in a 96.5% combined ratio. So I think that's pretty healthy.
And please remember that disability and accident is a more long-tail business, supported
by investment income. So break-even combined ratios would, indeed, -- would, in fact, be
in excess of 100%. So anyway 96.5% for the ﬁrst nine months of this year.
Then we go to the property and casualty side of the house. As I said, two main blocks of
business, the motor portfolio and the ﬁre portfolio. So let's ﬁrst talk about the motor
portfolio.
The combined ratio of the motor portfolio, which we ﬂagged earlier on already, is
something that we would pay attention to, has improved from 111% for the ﬁrst nine
months in 2014 to 108% now in the ﬁrst nine months of 2015.

Page 9 of 28

FINAL

We've taken measures; stricter underwriting criteria; we terminated large car ﬂeets; we
did diﬀerentiated premium rate increases in 2015; and we took some measures on lossmaking portfolios in the mandated broker channel.
Now, obviously, this -- it's nice to have some progress there. But that progress is
something that we're still working on to improve further. And that is needed. So the next
steps of measures will include premium adjustments based on risk reviews. But it has our
full attention.
Then for the ﬁre portfolio, which is the other piece of property and casualty, the combined
ratio has deteriorated for the ﬁrst nine months (207%) these nine months for this year
versus 100% for the ﬁrst nine months of last year.
Those were due to some large ﬁre claims in the past few quarters. And obviously we've
been reviewing these large ﬁre claims. But we cannot discern a clear pattern. The causes
are diverse. They are widely spread in terms of the geography, the types of buildings etc.

Bloomberg Transcript

The measures that have been taken so far have been diﬀerentiated premium rate
increases that we did in the course of this year. And we've increased the number of
inspections to prevent, let's say, fraud and those kinds of things. The next steps are that
we are also actively working on improving ﬁre prevention etc.
So we recognize that there is improvement to be needed in getting the combined ratio in
a better place. We're having -- we took quite some measures. I gave you, book by book,
the kind of -- the comments that we make at this point in time. And for the remainder our
focus will be on improving this business further to get it to the combined ratio target by
2019 of 97%.
And with that I'd like to hand over to Delﬁn Rueda for the capital-related questions.

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes, Col, I think three questions still to be answered, the ﬁrst one, what was paid in the
Fourth Quarter in terms of dividends, cash ﬂows to the holding company. Obviously, you,
I think, mention it yourself. There is the EUR120 million dividends which have already been
paid in October from NN Life.
You have to keep in mind. And we ﬂagged that in the past, that generally speaking both
for Japan Life and for Insurance Europe the majority of the dividends might come in the
Second Quarter. So there could be some dividends or not on those areas. However, from
the attached entities there is much more ﬂexibility of having dividends on a regular basis.
In terms of the actual dividends received in the second -- in the Third Quarter of the year,
EUR125 million was the dividend that we received from NN Life in July. Then the
remaining is basically EUR65 million we received from NN Re mainly reﬂecting the run oﬀ
of the Japan closed block VA. And the rest is spread between Netherlands non-life, asset
management and our insurance subsidiary in Ireland.

FINAL

The third question was about the Solvency II. And on that we obviously gave the guidance
of the level around 200% at the end of last year. We -- it's early to provide more speciﬁc
information in relation to Solvency II. There is only a few months now to come into place.
Our (basal) internal model has been we are in constructive discussion with the regulator
and the capital generation that has occurred during the -- since the end of 2014 has been
strong. That has improved our Solvency I ratio despite the fact of the EUR850 million of
capital distributed to our shareholders.
And it's fair to say that also under Solvency II, although obviously at diﬀerent levels, there
has been some improvement over the last eight months. During the capital markets day
on November 19 we obviously will cover in more detail with an update on Solvency II.
Does that --?

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning, Lard. Good morning, Delﬁn. Just a couple of questions. First of all,
how should we think about Japan closed block VA, i.e., can you give us the capital -solvency capital number that is there which we should expect to be released over the next
ﬁve, six years? Because clearly you have been getting some dividend out already. So what
is the remaining capital there? That's number one.
Secondly is how should we think about cash ﬂows from Netherlands? Now, I think we
need to diﬀerentiate between the fungibility, i.e., you have one -- your cash generation is
moving up very fast because of markets getting better, spreads are tightening. So that is
moving up very fast. But at the same time that may not be really fungible, okay, because
you haven't realized those at the moment.
So how should we think about cash ﬂows coming out of Netherlands? Should we continue
to think about your old slide which you showed that it should -- over time it should be
similar to that of IFRS operating proﬁt? How should we think about that? Because clearly
you're getting huge amount of cash ﬂows out of Netherlands Life every quarter, which I
think, if I'm not wrong, is more than what you're earning in NN Life. So any thoughts on
these two questions would be great. Thank you.

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Yes, Ashik, thanks for this. So Delﬁn will take these questions.

Yes, Ashik I -- indeed, at the time of the IPO we said that NN Re in the Netherlands had
approximately EUR900 million of available capital back in the Japan closed block VA.

FINAL

Please, one thing to bear in mind is that dividends are paid by the legal entity, which
includes other internal insurance in addition to the Japan closed block VA. Since the IPO
NN Re has paid the EUR250 million dividends. So it's been a good level of repatriation of
capital to the holding company.
The run-oﬀ portfolio is running according to plans and we still expect that NN Re will
release capital, basically their own funds, maybe approximately EUR700 million by the
end of 2019, plus or minus hedge results.
In terms of cash ﬂow from the Netherlands I think, indeed, you're right when you point out
that a signiﬁcant part, actually, the largest part, of the capital generation in -- particularly in
NN Life is related to market evolution. But also there has been a good contribution from
operating activities there.
The reality is that despite the dividends that we have paid out from the Dutch entities the
level of solvency has continued to improve under Solvency I. And obviously markets and
conditions will decide how this will ﬂow. But we do consider that structurally these entities
have the capacity to have a regular ﬂow of dividends to the holding company.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Yes. But just to follow-up on that, what I'm trying to understand is how should we
diﬀerentiate between the capital that is generated from markets and the capital that is
generated from earnings and, say, capital released?
So how should we think about the dividend that comes out of NN Life, i.e., do you keep in
mind -- when you release capital from NN Life do you really keep in mind that a lot of that
capital generation is coming from markets, i.e., let's not touch that capital. And let's just
take out the capital which is coming from earnings or regular capital release because of
run oﬀ?

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes, I'm a simple person, Ashik. And I do consider that capital is capital. Obviously, we do
understand what is the origin for the movements of capital (and no doubt) markets due to
the characteristics of the Solvency regime that we are currently operating in the
Netherlands and that in an amended form we will continue to operate within Europe
based on Solvency II that volatility (has ceased).
So obviously when deciding the capital distribution we look at sensitivities, we look at
what might happen under diﬀerent scenarios, what is the level of the solvency at that
point of time and what is the expected evolution of this solvency going forward. But I
would say that in terms of the capital position of the entity I'm a little bit less concerned
about the source of it.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Hello. Thank you very much. First of all, the PE dividends that are boosting your Dutch life
results, can you just go ﬁrst -- back to ﬁrst principles and explain to me how that works?
Because whilst they're very welcome for the shareholder I would have thought that this is
reﬂecting investments that are largely intended to generate policyholder crediting rates.
And whilst you don?t have an oﬃcial proﬁt sharing I would have thought there's some
kind of unoﬃcial obligation to pass this money back to your customers. So is the EUR110
million in life basically a net ﬁgure from a really big gross ﬁgure? Or is this for some
reason the shareholder genuinely beneﬁting from all of the gains that you're making on
the PE portfolio? I'm just a bit confused there.

Bloomberg Transcript

Then secondly, sorry, this is somewhat going back over Ashik's issues. But to what extent
do you think your buybacks this year represent exceptional activity? Because we know
your medium-term target of free cash ﬂow versus net operating proﬁt. But this year there's
a remarkable -- it's basically ING that is driving your capital repatriation. You're doing
buybacks to coincide with when they decide to sell shares.
And if one's cynical you could say that, actually, the amount you?ve repatriated so far is
just close to what ING put in just before you IPO'd. Not that that's not very welcome. But
I'm trying to get clear in my own mind what you think is going to be the sustainable
picture that we look at once the ING unwind has occurred. Thank you.

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Thanks, William. Delﬁn, please.

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes, William, on the private equity you have to take into account that whenever -- this
private equity of EUR127 million is basically the result of the disposal of one particular
investment. So in the past the appreciation or the revaluations on this stake has been
reﬂected in the line revaluations, a part of the non-operating result.
So at the time of the disposal that ﬂows in our proﬁt and loss accounts and in our
management accounting as part of the investment margin. And that is -- have the
opposite eﬀect of a (deduction) in the same amount in the revaluation as part of the nonoperating results.

FINAL

So the EUR127 million is coming through the investment margin. You see the same
amount deducted in the revaluations, obviously. The revaluations is less negative than that
because there were also other revaluations in equity and real estate.
In terms of the capital repatriation and the buybacks I think, obviously, we are the ones
who decide how much and in which form we gave back capital to our shareholders. And
we have highlighted in the past that as long as we have the opportunity to do it,
participating in the buybacks of ING, we thought that this was a very eﬀective manner to
pay back the surplus capital to shareholders.
So to the extent that we continue to believe that there is surplus capital we will decide
accordingly in which form to give back this excess capital to shareholders, being in the
form of share buybacks if other occasions come in the future or in any other form.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Thank you. And just to come back to your PE answer, which I think I followed, I suppose it
still leaves open the question is there any risk that there's a negative true-up at some
point in the future, because you only decide your crediting rates annually?

Bloomberg Transcript

And I'm still -- whilst I understand the accounting answer you just gave, you've still
eﬀectively allocated all of the return on this PE portfolio to the shareholder, if I understand
correctly. So I just wonder if there was going to be some kind of true-up at some point in
the future when you give your customers the beneﬁt of that return.

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

No, let's say that generally speaking the investments in equity and, certainly, private
equity they are more invested on behalf of the shareholders' equity of our capital.
In any event, the rules for proﬁt sharing are determined at the level of NN Life according
to the characteristics of this proﬁt sharing and what is the actual proﬁt of the Company at
that point of time.
But there is no direct link between that dividend or which percentage of that will be paid
for the proﬁt sharing. As I said, basically, the equities, in particular, they are invested on
behalf -- is the capital of the Company which invests in equity.

Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. First one is on solvency. Again, if
you could just update us on the remaining uncertainties around Solvency II, both on the
standard formula and the internal model that would be welcome.

FINAL

Also wondering whether any of these uncertainties could have a material impact on the
guidance going forward, which is a level of around 200%. So that's the ﬁrst question.
Secondly is on Dutch Life. There were a number of one-oﬀs, including a private equity
dividend also in the technical margin. If I strip them out both the investment margin and
the technical margin are up on the underlying level of last year Q3. Just wonder if you
could talk me through the main drivers here. So what's happening on the underlying level
both in the investment margin and technical margin, please? Thanks.

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Yes, Matthias, thank you very much. So ﬁrst on your -- on the solvency question, Doug.
And then on the margin for -- the investment margin and technical margin for NN Life,
Delﬁn. So ﬁrst over to you, Doug.

A - Doug Caldwell

{BIO 17900909 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Yes, I think when we look at the uncertainties that remain on standard model and
partial internal model I think the one that aﬀects both is probably tax. There are still some
ongoing discussions on how the tax of the SCR will be treated.
And that is something that we remain in good discussions with the regulator on and at
this point we -- that is as far as we know. We have the numbers and we've given the
guidance based on what we are aware of to date.
Then the other main uncertainty is simply the partial internal model approval process,
which we aim to complete as soon as possible. And we remain in constructive discussions
with the regulator. But it's not complete yet.

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

So Delﬁn, the margins?

Q - Matthias De Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

And on the tax is it like -- could it materially impact if there's no tax relief on SCR, or is it
more a small minor item for you guys?

A - Doug Caldwell

{BIO 17900909 <GO>}

I think we can't give further guidance on (a) potential size. We have reﬂected in our
guidance in the range of 200% our best understanding of how taxes should work under
Solvency II. And if there is ever any further change then we will report that at that time.

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

So with that, Delﬁn, over to the margins in NN Life.

FINAL

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes. So in investment margin, indeed, we have seen some volatility on the investment
margin particularly due to relatively large dividends coming from private equity due to
disposals of stakes. We have obviously been active on trying to compensate the pressure
on our book yield as investments come to maturity.
And during the Third Quarter of 2015 we have actually allocated approximately EUR1.2
billion to -- majority of it, as you know, being mortgages and a smaller amount in private
loans and real estate. So this is one part of which, as you know, we are compensated (a
decline).
Diﬃcult to provide any precise guidance here. I think that the best I can say at this point of
time is to repeat the guidance that we gave at the time of trying to stay around the level of
(2013) investment margin over invested asset that was around 100 basis points or so.

Bloomberg Transcript

In terms of the technical margin, this is more of a complicated topic. And if I try to simplify
I would say that, obviously, we have seen a lot of volatility in this line during both 2014 but
also in the ﬁrst nine months of the year. If I try to normalize that again insisting that the
volatility will assist, because every quarter we are basically highlighting some changes
related to one aspect or another.
But I would say that something around EUR30m, EUR35 million per quarter should be
kind of the normal trend. Although I must ﬂag it as well that there is a trend for this margin
to come down due to the run oﬀ of the individual life (closed) block as well as some
pressure on mortality and morbidity proﬁt. So I don't think I can be more precise than
that. But again I insist there's going to be volatility in the quarters to come.

Hi, everybody, I don't have any solvency questions. But just on the signiﬁcance of this
agreement that you have in the Dutch business for the general pension fund at the APF
with NN Investment Partners, is this basically -- could you just tell us roughly what this is?
And is this basically a source of future ﬂows for your asset management business rather
than your insured pensions business?

Page 16 of 28



Company Name: NN Group NV
Company Ticker: NN NA Equity
Date: 2015-11-04

FINAL

Then lastly on your -- if you look at your distributions to date in terms of dividends and
buybacks they're running at roughly 85% to 90% of your holding company cash
(reserves). So you're giving most of it back. If I made the assumption that I don't see you
necessarily participating in M&A in the short term is that a good guide for the kind of
distribution you could make? Thanks.

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Yes, Farooq, hi, this is Lard. So on the APF, this is APF, PPI. There is a number of vehicles
that are created through legislation in the Netherlands in which you can organize pension
systems -- pensions. And that can be done in various ways, shapes or form and the APF is
a very new vehicle that can be set up.
And we are doing that because we are a pension player and we want to be able to
provide in the pension space and in the pension market all solutions that can help our
clients to run their pension schemes, whether it's in the form of insured solutions, whether
it's in the form of unbundled solutions, whether it's in the form of record-keeping
solutions etc. So this is -- and this is another one that we're setting up with NN IP, which is
the asset manager to do this. So that's another vehicle for this.
In terms of the excess cash, Delﬁn?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes, I think it's -- obviously, in the ﬁrst nine months of the year we had a very high payout,
you like, in terms of cash distribution to shareholders. But also from subsidiaries to the
holding and we have always said that that will ﬂuctuate over time.
The only thing I can refer back is to the same guidance that over time we do expect to
have this cash holding -- cash capital at holding to be in the range of the operating result
after tax with volatility up and down.
Then in terms of the criteria to distribute that to shareholders, obviously, that depends on
where our solvency ratio starts (at any) point of time and then looking at the expected
evolution in the short term. So I think hopefully we can become predictable for you in the
sense of how we have acted so far and how we want to continue going forward on that
sense.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

So just to go back on that -- the two questions. So on cash, obviously, if your solvency was
weak we wouldn't expect you to pay out. But if you're happy with solvency, if the internal
model goes your way, if you're still generating cash then what you're basically saying, I
guess, is that we wouldn't be crazy to assume a high payout of the free cash. Is that
correct?

Company Name: NN Group NV

FINAL

Yes. Obviously, I think it's important to create some predictability in our ordinary dividend.
That's why when we set our dividend policy we were very clear and speciﬁc; we said that
as a guidance.
Obviously, a guidance doesn't restrict you from being outside of that range. But as a
guidance we will try in order to be predictable to be in the ordinary dividend between
this 40% and 50% of the operating result and then acting with extraordinary dividends, or
cash buybacks, or in -- depending on what the level of excess capital is at any point of
time.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

And just I'll follow-up with IR on the general pension fund. But just -- so I'm familiar
roughly with what the APF is. But would I be correct in thinking, look, it's a business
opportunity. But it's not big in the short term?

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes. I think in terms of the APF, obviously, this is a combination of our pension
administrator and then the asset management. And therefore we would expect some
management fees there and, obviously, future will tell how much of a business
opportunity that will constitute.

Q - William Elderkin

{BIO 3349136 <GO>}

Thanks. Hi, everybody, one follow-up ﬁrst of all. In your answer to an earlier question you
said a normalized investment margin for the Dutch Life business of around 100 bps with
invested assets there about EUR60b. Is that eﬀectively talking to EUR600 million a year
thereabouts? The reason for just checking is I thought that the margin was more 105 bps
to 110 basis points. I just want to check I've understood you correctly.
Then three quick ones. Firstly, can you just give us -- remind us what the Group tax rate
guidance is? It seems to have been rather low so far this year.
Second, on the Japanese Life business should we expect that negative investment margin
to persist just given where the reinvestment rates are?
Thirdly, on the Polish business the earnings there quarter on quarter seem to have
stabilized, given various things that's been going on in the background. Is that now a
reliable run rate from which to work going forward?

Then the last one was on the Dutch non-life combined ratio. Would you be able to give us
the percentage-point components of prior-year release and the eﬀect of all the storms
and so forth in the Third Quarter?

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

FINAL

Are they all for Delﬁn?

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes. So (inaudible) the -- sorry, I think I had the microphone switched oﬀ so I will start
again answering the question then. A lot of questions, the ﬁrst one is the normalized
investment margin. And I think we don't need to confuse the investment income from the
investment margin (of) investment margin itself.
In terms of the tax rate, obviously, as there has been a lot of proﬁts coming from equities,
from stakes where we own more than 5%, most of it, these are tax exempt and as a
consequence the eﬀective tax rate is low. And that is the main reason to explain the
eﬀective tax rate. Also keep in mind that under IFRS we normalize the eﬀective tax rate
taking into account the expectations of the tax rate for the full year.

Bloomberg Transcript

In terms of Japan Life the question was negative investment rate going forward. Indeed,
when you look -- in order to think about Japan Life you need to consider that the majority
of the proﬁt is coming from our fee; and premium-based revenue.
The low interest rate has put a lot of pressure within the investment return there and
therefore you have to understand the proﬁtability combined between the investment
income, the fees, as well as the technical margin. But indeed the negative investment
margin is likely to continue.
I think I'm missing one or two questions. The Polish pension reform, if the current quarter
is a reliable rate going forward. And I would say so. In terms of the combined ratio of nonlife, amount of prior accident years, I think it's around EUR4 million to EUR5 million
negative impact in the quarter related to previous accident years.
In terms of storms and others I think for the storms was EUR6 million and I think ﬁres was
around EUR5m. So is -- obviously, we're not pleased with the performance on non-life. But
also it's fair to recognize that there has been a combination of many negative factors
aﬀecting this quarter and certainly this is not a normalized quarter.

Q - William Elderkin

{BIO 3349136 <GO>}

Thank you. Can I just check one point, just on that Dutch investment margin thing? I just
want to check I'm thinking about the same things you are.
When you refer to that 100 basis point investment margin are you relating that investment
margin line we see in the Dutch Life P&L to the overall Dutch Life general account assets
of about EUR6b? Are those the numbers you had in mind when you made that statement?

as -- obviously, it's going to be diﬀerent. But this is what we said by the time of the IPO
and this is the guidance that I -- we maintain.

Q - Gordon Aitken

{BIO 3846728 <GO>}

Thank you, just one question, please. Can you just comment on the competitive
landscape in the Dutch market on the life side? On one hand you might think competition
might be decreasing, given a couple of the large players might not want to put on any
more risk onto their balance sheets. On the other hand we heard from Legal & General
today saying they are likely to be doing a buyout in the coming months in the Dutch
market. Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Yes, Gordon, if you look at the competitive landscape in the life insurance business in the
Netherlands let me give you some comments. So the ﬁrst one is the -- on the individual
side it's all about term life and about some direct annuities. However, the underlying need
for long-term savings, which used to be catered for in the form of individual life insurance
policies, is of course still there and that is being taken care of in -- by NN Bank.
So we are still active in the space of long-term savings, this time not in the form of
individual life insurance contracts. But in the form of savings through long-term savings
bank annuities etc. through NN Bank. So that's I think on the individual side where we see
competition. But where we're active and we're very well positioned with our brand in the
retail market.
Then if you go to the pension business, the pension business there is a couple of
dimensions there. The ﬁrst one is we are large, we are very well positioned, we have not
only solutions in the insured -- for insured deﬁned beneﬁt type of pensions. But also
especially for deﬁned contribution pensions, record-keeping services through our AZL
subsidiary, a range of funds in asset management and services and LDI driven investment
etc.
So we have a lot of angles and a lot of rods in the pond, if you will, when it comes to the
pension space and we're very well positioned in a strong market-leading position there.
We believe that the underlying theme for the future is really in having more individual
involvement of people in their own pension build up. So this means more a deﬁned
Page 20 of 28



Company Name: NN Group NV
Company Ticker: NN NA Equity
Date: 2015-11-04

contribution drive that we see happening, of course, spurred also by the low rate
environment and by longevity assumptions, which make quotes for deﬁned beneﬁts -traditional deﬁned beneﬁt plans very expensive.

FINAL

And as a result our clients also want to adapt their pension arrangements more towards
deﬁned contribution. And we're helping them doing that with a full range of products and
services there.
Now, when it comes to the buyout market, the buyout market is an opportunity still. It's an
opportunity where smaller pension funds want to ﬁnd a new home for their liabilities,
small and medium-sized pension funds. We do play in that market. We are active in the
RP's that come through. However, we have very clear and disciplined return requirements
on the capital that we employ and the risk that we take on our books.
So we are active. We are one of the few players that can -- I think can write this business.
But we maintain disciplined in our pricing methodologies and will only transact
successfully if we can help the client. But also make sure that we maintain appropriate
compensation for our capital employed.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Gordon Aitken

{BIO 3846728 <GO>}

Thank you. Let's come back on that buyout space then. You're obviously not writing much
business there. Of the three options, which of it is? Is it a case that no pension plans are
coming to the market, or is it, secondly, that there are some coming. But they're sinking
themselves into industry funds? Or is it a case that they are coming to the market and
they're going to competitors?
And also if you can comment on is the buyout market quite seasonal. So in the UK it
would be an awful lot of business coming in the Fourth Quarter. Is that the same in the
Dutch market? Thanks.

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Well ﬁrst on the seasonality, often times -- I'm not saying this is a rule of thumb that I'm
giving you, Gordon. It's not a rock solid, put in stone etc.. But usually it's that these buyout
arrangements, or also large pension contract renewals, by the way, they usually happen at
the date of the beginning of the year. So at January 1. So that's usually the date in which
this happens.
So the -- but the process to get there. So the RFBs, the negotiations and all that are all
processes that happen, of course, way in advance of that. So -- because these are quite
elaborate. So that's one thing I'd like to say.
The second is we see a number of things happening. First of all, we see SME companies
but also larger companies changing their pension schemes from deﬁned beneﬁt to
hybrids or to deﬁned contribution, where they often time also make a split between the
accrued build up in the past and the accruals that you will see for the new vintages
moving forward.
Page 21 of 28



Company Name: NN Group NV

FINAL

So this is something that happens with our clients. But also of course with clients of our
competitors. And we try and ﬁght and convince also clients (with) our competitors to join
us and our service and our product oﬀering. So that's what we do. That's basically a
replacement of existing stock in the market and existing plans in the market with their new
vintages because we're in a quite mature place.
Now, there's also new business coming to the market from pension funds that decide not
to do it in a pension fund standalone format any longer. But want to go -- to get their
liabilities on the balance sheets of insurance companies. And that's what, of course, is
new, because they move from non-insured or own insured solutions today to insured
solutions with insurance companies in the future. And that of course is a new business that
you can put (that you can) compete for.
So this -- and ﬁnally there's a debate going on right now, a quite ﬁerce debate in the
Netherlands, where there are -- it's called the National Pension Debate where there's new
regulation being discussed actively in various stages. And we just have to wait and see
how that comes through the parliamentary system. I do expect, however, that the
underlying trend is that you will see more the push for deﬁned contribution also in the
future.

Afternoon, gentlemen, just really one question from me on solvency capital. If we just look
at your Solvency I ratio as a kind of guidance point, obviously, that's improved materially
quarter on quarter and you've cited the impact of narrowing spreads on sovereign.
Am I right in thinking that that would have followed through into the Solvency II
movement quarter on quarter, i.e., presumably Solvency II would have also gone up
quarter on quarter? Is that right?

Delﬁn will take this question, Farquhar.

A - Delﬁn Rueda

Yes, Farquhar is right that over the last nine months of the year there has been some
improvement on the Solvency II ratios under the standard formula. The internal model has
also followed a similar pattern, although over that period of time there has always been
some realignments in the model itself which obviously will not come to an end until it is
approved by the regulator. But under the standard formula, yes, it's right.

Hi there, just a quick question on investment management, if you don't mind. It was
supposed to be one of the bright spots at the time of the IPO. And we're seeing down
ﬂows again.
Now, I appreciate it's a function of the market as well. But could you give some color
prospectively on what you see as ﬂows developing, whether you're fully invested now in
the teams you wanted, (whether) you've got all the funds in place, some color on
mandates etc.?
And also just a very quick follow-up on the Dutch buyout market, given we've touched
upon that. Have you seen more business opportunities or any impact on pricing from
competitive behavior, given, for example, Delta Lloyds (ﬂows) related to Solvency II?
Thanks.

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Yes, Fahad. So ﬁrst on the buyouts, as I said, these are lumpy processes. Therefore, we
have seen over the last years pricing levels improving. We were able to transact on a big
buyout in the beginning of the year for, I think, to the tune of EUR420 million roughly. So
we were able to transact. And as I said we are playing in that space. But we play in that
space with discipline and that's what we maintain to do.
When it comes to asset management let me start by saying that there's a market context
here that we need to understand ﬁrst, which is that the Third Quarter of 2015 was diﬃcult
for the asset management -- active asset management industry in general on the back of
what we've seen, which is an increased global market volatility, a decline in the oil prices,
concerns about China etc. and that has resulted in outﬂows of assets.

Page 23 of 28

FINAL

You may have seen also media reports quoting that seven of the world's largest fund
managers saw their assets drop as well in the Third Quarter of 2015. So we've not been
immune to that development either. So if you look at the net outﬂows let us break that
down.
The net outﬂows there was -- the decrease of the AUMs were net outﬂows of EUR3.2
billion and negative market performance of EUR1.3b. And in the net outﬂows we need to
of course look at proprietary versus third party.
The proprietary net outﬂows is EUR1 billion and this reﬂected, among other things, the
shift in general account assets from ﬁxed income assets to higher-yielding assets such as
mortgages and real estate, as well as some run-oﬀ elements in our business. So that is
basically something that is self-driven, if you will.
In the other aﬃliated business we had EUR0.5 billion of net outﬂows. This is mainly related
to the lower assets under management at the Japan closed block VA due to the portfolio
run oﬀ that we had seen, of course.

Bloomberg Transcript

Then there is a -- then what remains is a net outﬂow in third party of EUR1.7 billion and this
is mainly related to the institutional equity and ﬁxed income funds as well as retail clients
de-risking their portfolios. So -- but we aim to continue to leverage our established
strengths to gain new business in what we think are sizeable markets.
So yes, we want to increase commercial traction. We are re-positioning some of our
ﬂagship equity strategies into some higher active risk proﬁles and we're expanding our
suite of products. And at the same time we also invest in investment teams and marketing
teams and that's what you can see coming through in the higher staﬀ-related expenses
which have been visible in the last few quarters.
But having said that, of course, we aim for more commercial traction against a not easy
market backdrop. But we aim for, of course, more commercial traction and, obviously,
we'll keep a sharp eye in that context on the costs -- cost evolution moving forward.

Q - Fahad Changazi

{BIO 15216120 <GO>}

Okay. (So foregoing) next year, notwithstanding what happens with markets, we're still
expecting very good ﬂows to come through asset management?

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Obviously, we're aiming for increasing commercial traction. But -- and as we progress we
will report any outcome of that in the coming year of quarters.

(Guillame Horvath), Exane BNP Paribas.

Q - Guillaume Horvath
Yes, hello, thank you for taking my question. It's basically about UFR. So as you know,
(AYOPA) has said that it would probably review the methodology under which it
calculates UFR after 2016. So basically my question is going to be pretty simple.
Is this worrying to you? And are you planning to give more details about the Solvency II
sensitivity to UFR during your capital markets day? Or is it too much to ask? Thanks very
much.

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Okay, Guillaume, thank you very much for your question. Delﬁn?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes, of course, there's been a lot of discussions and speculation about the UFR and I think
AYOPA has made clear that they will review the level at which the UFR is established and
that they will do that over the next year, consulting market participants and then,
obviously, any potential change could only occur after 2017 onwards.
We need, of course, all not to forget that the UFR (pertains) to be a very long-term level of
interest rates and not something to be looked at with very short timeframe. In any event,
as many other aspects, these are inputs that we have to follow depending on how things
evolve.
Your question was if we were concerned. We're not particularly concerned and, indeed,
during the capital markets day this will be something that, obviously, we will talk about.
But I don't think it's very helpful to highlight UFR in particular as one speciﬁc element
where there are so many forming part of the overall Solvency II regulatory framework.

Q - Guillaume Horvath
Okay, good. Thanks.

Yes, hi, thank you, just a couple of follow-up questions. Is it possible to get your NN Life
back book running yield? That's number one.

FINAL

And secondly, in the Dutch buyout market I just want to understand how does it work?
When you take on the assets are those assets majority invested in corporate bonds, or do
you think about equal split between sovereign and other sort of bonds?
Because clearly in UK the (phenomena that) works is basically when generally companies
take bulk annuities they put everything into corporate bonds. Now insurers are talking
about putting into direct investment infrastructure. So it's a very (high risky) element. So
what do you do when you take a big bulk annuity deal in Netherlands? Yes. That would be
great, thank you.

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Yes. Thanks, Ashik. I'll -- the Dutch buyout market, the assets etc.. So, Doug, can you
comment on that? Then the running yield I think it's something that Delﬁn will thereafter,
Ashik.

A - Doug Caldwell

{BIO 17900909 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. I think we have a general method where we look to invest in any pension asset, any
pension liabilities that we have, whether they be regular or whether they be from the
buyout. We have an asset allocation that we generally (turn) to that, of course, is adjusted
based on markets at the time.
It clearly involves some government bonds, because we have -- those are very long dated.
So it helps match some of the interest rate risk. But these are also very illiquid liabilities.
So we also do not -- we also believe we should be capturing some of that illiquidity
spread.
You've seen us investing more in mortgages recently because we ﬁnd those have been
attractive. We also look at -- we do look at corporate bonds. We look at the asset universe
that's available to us and try to get a good overall -- the best overall risk return over a long
period.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

But is it more skewed towards high riskier assets, or is it partly split between lower risk like
sovereign and others?

A - Doug Caldwell

{BIO 17900909 <GO>}

No. I think you've seen -- I think you've seen our balance sheet. We had a signiﬁcant
number of highly-rated sovereigns (multiple speakers).

Yes. But that's the back book. What I'm trying to understand is what the new book at the
moment, because clearly there is a chase for yield going on because it's tough to make a
spread at the moment with a lot of sovereign bonds. So --?

FINAL

A - Doug Caldwell

{BIO 17900909 <GO>}

Well we -- I think when we look at a buyout deal, for instance, we will look at what assets
we can buy. I think in order to match the interest rate risk you have to include a decent
portion of sovereigns. But not completely.
And the other thing I think is important from our perspective is we generally manage the
overall balance sheet together more than segmented for every single deal that we do.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Okay, that's very clear. Thank you.

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Delﬁn, the back book.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

And just one part on the running yield on your back book for Dutch Life.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Lard Friese

{BIO 17008174 <GO>}

Yes, Delﬁn?

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes, Ashik. So the book yield on our ﬁxed income investment portfolio in Netherlands Life
was 3.7% in the Third Quarter.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

3.7% in Third Quarter, you mean, this (must be stable), right? We are talking about
running yield. So nothing to do with market ﬂuctuation and all.

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

But obviously there is assets that comes to maturity or renewal and then there is new
assets being added on. And as you can imagine the newer investment yields are
signiﬁcantly lower than 3.7%.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Yes. That's clear. Okay. Thanks a lot for this.

FINAL

Yes. So for everybody on the call I would like to thank you all for your attention and for
your questions. So let me wrap up by saying that we are pleased with another set of solid
results for the Third Quarter of 2015.
Our capital position remains strong and this has allowed us to deliver on our equity story
of returning excess capital to our shareholders unless we can deploy that capital in other
value-created opportunities.
We continue to make good progress to achieve our strategic ﬁnancial targets. However,
we are fully aware that there is still more work to do to further improve performance
within the business and, in particular, to reduce the combined ratio of our Dutch non-life
unit and to drive third-party inﬂows at our asset manager.

Our entire management team is fully focused on this while never losing sight of our
primary responsibility of delivering an excellent service to our customers. With that, thank
you very much and have a good day.
