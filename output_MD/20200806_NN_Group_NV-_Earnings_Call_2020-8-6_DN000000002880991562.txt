FINAL

Yes, good morning, everyone and welcome to our conference call to discuss NN Group's
results for the ﬁrst half of 2020. I'm joined today by Delﬁn Rueda, our Chief Financial
Oﬃcer, and Bernhard Kaufmann, our Chief Risk Oﬃcer. As usual, I will ﬁrst take you
through the highlights of the ﬁrst half-year results. Delﬁn will then talk in more detail
about the solvency position, operating capital generation as well as the ﬁnancial results of
the group. After wrapping up the presentation, I will open up the call for Q&A.
Let me start with the highlights shown on slide three. It's been an extraordinary ﬁrst half of
the year in many ways, ﬁrst and foremost, because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our ﬁrst
priority has been the well-being of our employees and an uninterrupted service to our
customers. Thanks to robust systems and new ways of working, we have been able to
continue supporting our customers through these turbulent times. Of course, COVID-19
did impact our business. For example, the lockdown restrictions meant having to ﬁnd new
digital tools for brokers and agents to reach customers to remotely. And we provided
payment and premium holidays for customers experiencing ﬁnancial diﬃculties.

On the other hand, we saw a lower frequency of P&C claims reﬂecting less traﬃc on the
roads and more people staying at home, which largely oﬀset the higher D&A claims,
resulting in a combined ratio of 94.9% for the ﬁrst half of the year. All in all, the impact on
the operating result of around EUR30 million has been limited so far, while sales and new
business were clearly much lower than in the same period last year. Similarly, operating
capital generation held up well amounting to EUR543 million in the ﬁrst half of the year.
Another important event in the ﬁrst half of 2020 was the completion of the acquisition of
VIVAT Non-life on 1st of April. We have welcomed the VIVAT employees and customers
and started the process of integrating the business. It also contributed to results in the
ﬁrst half of the year.
Despite the volatile environment, our balance sheet remains resilient. NN Group Solvency
II ratio is 221%, which is after deduction of the interim dividend announced today. And the
cash capital position is EUR1.3 billion, reﬂecting cash outﬂows, such as the consideration
paid for VIVAT Non-life and a redemption of the EUR300 million senior debt in June.
Our decision to suspend the 2019 ﬁnal dividend and share buyback program in April was
in response to the recommendations of the European and Dutch regulators, given the
uncertainty around how COVID-19 would develop. However, it has always been our
intention to make those distribution to shareholders in the second half of the year, if and
when appropriate. And therefore, we have today announced that we are resuming the
share buyback and will pay an interim dividend of EUR2.26 per ordinary share, which
comprises the amount of the suspended ﬁnal dividend, plus the regular interim dividend.
Turning to slide four. At our Capital Markets Day in June, we set out the strategic
initiatives that underpin our commitment to creating sustainable value for our
stakeholders, by increasing cash ﬂow generation and driving growth in attractive markets.
In May, NN Life completed a sizable longevity deal, which reduces our exposure to
longevity risk and consequently further strengthens our capital position. The resulting

FINAL

capital beneﬁt has allowed NN Life to further shift to higher-yielding assets and increase
its quarterly dividends to the holding company.
In the ﬁrst half of the year, we accelerated the shift to higher-yielding assets. We invested
more than EUR4 billion in investment grade bonds, high-yield bonds, equities and
emerging market debt, also taking advantage of the market opportunities especially in
March and April. Even with the COVID restrictions and the challenges of developing new
online sales process, we continue to launch new products to meet customer needs. For
example, a unique product in Poland, allowing people already suﬀering from diabetes to
take out this protection insurance. And in Japan, we introduced the Emergency Plus COLI
product in early March, which provides attractive beneﬁts also under the new rules.
Our asset manager, NN Investment Partners, collaborated with a strategic partner China
Asset Management to launch its inaugural ESG-integrated China A-Share Equities
strategy, responding to the growing demand for investment strategies that integrate
Environmental, Social and Governance factors.

Bloomberg Transcript

Moving to slide ﬁve. As I already mentioned, new sales were impacted by the COVID
restrictions from March onwards. In turn, the value of new business was down versus the
same period, also reﬂecting decreased interest rates as well as strong sales in the ﬁrst
quarter of 2019 ahead of the implementation of the revised tax regulations for COLI
products in Japan.
On the other hand, the mortgage market remains strong. NN Bank originated EUR4.4
billion of new mortgages in the ﬁrst half of 2020, of which EUR2.9 billion was transferred
to the Group's insurance companies for their investment portfolios, as well as to NN IP's
third-party Dutch Mortgage Fund.
Total assets under management at NN IP increased EUR285 billion at the end of June,
reﬂecting positive market performance as well as inﬂow of assets. Even though there were
outﬂows of assets mainly in March, this was more than oﬀset by strong inﬂows at the
beginning of the year and the second quarter. On balance, we saw a net inﬂow of EUR3.5
billion in third-party assets.
On slide six, we show our progress on cost reductions. We continue to work towards
achieving our target to reduce the expense base of the business units in the scope of
integration by EUR400 million by the end of this year. In the ﬁrst half of 2020, we realize
additional cost savings of EUR21 million, bringing the total cost reductions to date to
EUR381 million compared with the 2016 full-year expense base. Even after we complete
this program, we will continue to focus on increasing eﬃciency throughout the
organization and this is reﬂected in the segment cost guidance that we gave at the Capital
Markets Day in June.
The following slide shows the capital returns announced today. We have a clear capital
return policy, consisting of a progressive dividend per share and an annual share buyback
of at least EUR250 million. Following the suspension of dividend payments and the share
buyback earlier this year, we are pleased to announce that we are now resuming capital

FINAL

returns to our shareholders. The interim dividend of EUR2.26 per share announced today
is essentially made up of two components, EUR1.40, which is the amount of the proposed
2019 ﬁnal dividend that was suspended, plus EUR0.86, which is the amount of the regular
2020 interim dividend calculated in accordance with our dividend policy.
In addition, we are resuming the share buyback program that was started in March and
then suspended in April. We had already completed EUR183 million of the EUR250
million program, so we will now execute the remaining EUR67 million. This announcement
today means that we will deliver on our intended capital distribution to shareholders.
And with that, I will pass it over to Delﬁn.

Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Thank you, David. And good morning, everyone. You will notice a change in the order of
my slides compared with previous presentations. This is because of our shift in focus
towards operating capital generation as announced at the Capital Markets Day. So let me
begin with the movements in NN Group's solvency position.

Bloomberg Transcript

I'm pleased that, despite the turbulent ﬁnancial markets in the past six months, we are
reporting a strong Solvency II ratio of 221% at the end of the ﬁrst half of 2020 versus 224%
at the end of 2019. Operating capital generation added 7 percentage points to the ratio. I
will talk more about the drivers of operating capital generation on the next slide.
We experienced extreme volatility in the markets in the ﬁrst six months of the year, but as
you -- as we have seen before, the longer-term market impact is relatively small. Market
variances reduced the ratio by 3 percentage points in the ﬁrst half of 2020, mainly due to
unfavorable credit spread movements as well as equity revaluations.
The category Other includes various items, with a positive contribution from the longevity
transactions, which more than compensated the negative impact of the reduction of the
UFR by 15 basis points at the start of the year and the acquisition of VIVAT Non-life.
Finally, the ratio reﬂects our deduction of capital ﬂows to shareholders of 11 percentage
points. This represents the announced interim dividend of EUR2.26 per share or
approximately EUR705 million in total, as well as the EUR183 million paid to repurchase
shares under the share buyback program, which began in March and was suspended in
April.
As you are aware, the Bank will be included in the calculation of the Solvency II ratio as
from at the end of the year. Based on current estimates, this will have a negative impact to
the Solvency Ratio of around 10 percentage points.
Let's turn to slide 10. Total operating capital generation in the ﬁrst half of 2020 amounted
to EUR543 million compared with EUR697 million in the same period last year. In the table
on this slide, you can see the split by segment. This is in line with the guidance we gave at
Page 4 of 18



Company Name: NN Group NV
Company Ticker: NN NA Equity
Date: 2020-08-06

the Capital Markets Day and reﬂects the exceptional circumstances we are facing this year,
given COVID-19.

FINAL

The decrease of operating capital generation reﬂects the negative impact of the UFR drag
and risk margin release as a result of the lower interest rates, mainly in Netherlands Life,
As well as the negative impact of the longevity reinsurance transactions. Another factor
was the fact that there was no contribution from the Bank in the ﬁrst half of this year
following the suspension of dividend payments on the recommendation of the regulator.
In addition, we saw a lower net business contribution in Insurance Europe as a result of
the COVID-19 restrictions, as well as lower margins due to a decrease in interest rates. On
the other hand, the shift to higher-yielding assets resulted in a higher investment return
mainly in Netherlands Life, and operating capital generation of the non-life business
includes the results of VIVAT Non-life as from April.

Bloomberg Transcript

As I already mentioned, the method for including the Bank in the Solvency II ratio and
therefore in operating capital generation will change as from the end of the year. If we
were to apply the new method already, operating capital generation for the bank for the
ﬁrst half of this year would have been approximately EUR50 million on a pro forma basis.
On the next slide, you can see that the cash capital position at the holding was EUR1.3
billion at the end of June 2020, compared with just under EUR2 billion at the end of 2019.
Total remittances received from subsidiaries amounted to EUR718 million. As usual, details
of all the remittances upstream by each segment can be found in the appendix of this
presentation.
During the period, we also had cash outﬂows, including the consideration paid for the
acquisition of VIVAT Non-life, the redemption of EUR300 million of senior debt and the
repurchase of own shares under the buyback programs executed in the ﬁrst half year.
Looking ahead, we expect cash capital to remain comfortably within our target range.
Besides outﬂows, such as the planned dividend payment, we will also continue to receive
dividends from our subsidiaries, including a dividend from NN Life of EUR225 million
each quarter.
Moving on to the next slide, I will take you through the IFRS ﬁnancial results of the group.
Starting on the left, NN Group's operating result increased to EUR926 million from EUR914
million in the same period last year. Let me remind you that the 2019 ﬁrst half-year result
included EUR67 million of private equity and special dividends, while the result for the
ﬁrst half of 2020 includes a much smaller amount of EUR16 million of private equity
dividends and non-recurrent beneﬁts, and also reﬂects the negative impact of COVID-19,
which, as David already mentioned, was around EUR30 million in the ﬁrst half of the year.
We will take you through the operating performance of the individual segments on the
next slide. On the right hand side, you can see that the net result for the ﬁrst half of 2020

FINAL

was EUR587 million. The decrease compared with the ﬁrst half of 2019 is mainly due to
lower non-operating items, in particular lower revaluations and market and other impacts,
reﬂecting the volatile markets as a result of COVID-19.
On the slide 13, let me run through the performance of each segment starting as usual
with Netherlands Life. The operating result of EUR494 million reﬂects a lower investment
margin as the ﬁrst half of 2019 beneﬁted from EUR67 million of private equity and special
dividends. While these dividends were just EUR9 million in the ﬁrst half of this year. At the
same time, we saw higher longevity and morbidity results in the ﬁrst half of 2020, as well
as lower administrative expenses.
The result of Netherlands Non-life increased to EUR111 million. We included the results of
VIVAT Non-Life as from 1st of April, which was a contribution of EUR20 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our Property & Casualty business reported higher underwriting results, including
favorable run-oﬀ results and a positive impact from COVID-19. On the other hand, we saw
lower underwriting results in Disability & Accident, including higher claims experience
due to COVID-19, the reduction of the reserve in discount rate and continued unfavorable
claims experience in Individual Disability, which was partly covered by internal
reinsurance. The combined ratio was 94.9%.
Insurance Europe's operating result decreased to EUR133 million from EUR140 million in
the ﬁrst half of 2019, which included a EUR6 million non-recurring beneﬁt. The operating
result of Japan Life was EUR138 million, up 12% excluding currency eﬀects. This reﬂects an
improved persistency of the in-force portfolio. Asset Management's result was stable at
EUR74 million.
The operating result of Banking increased to EUR80 million, which includes a EUR7 million
non-recurring beneﬁt relating to premiums on mortgages, sales to the NN IP Dutch
Residential Mortgage Fund. The interest result was also higher, reﬂecting lower funding
cost and higher penalty interest as customers took advantage of lower mortgage rates to
reﬁnance their loans.
Finally, the segment Other reﬂects a lower result at the reinsurance business partly oﬀset
by a higher holding result. In particular, the reinsurance result reﬂects EUR39 million of
claims related to Non-life's Disability portfolio, while at the same period in 2019 included
EUR13 million of such claims as well as a large claim from our legacy reinsurance portfolio.
With that, I will now pass you back to David for the wrap-up.

Thank you, Delﬁn. NN Group has today reported a strong set of results showing resilience
in a time of market turbulence and weathering the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our
capital position is robust with a Solvency II ratio of 221%, which already reﬂects the
deduction of the interim dividend of EUR2.26 per share that we announced today.

FINAL

Operating capital generation for the ﬁrst half of 2020 was EUR543 million, adding 7
percentage points to the ratio. During our Capital Markets Day in June, we presented our
strategy for NN Group and our aim to create sustainable value for our stakeholders. With
our priority to maintain a strong balance sheet and the strategic actions we are taking to
achieve resilient and growing long-term capital generation, we are well positioned to
navigate through volatile markets, drive proﬁtable growth, and deliver attractive capital
returns going forward.
I will now hand you back to the operator to open up the call for your questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you, Mr. Knibbe. (Operator Instructions) And the ﬁrst question is from Mr. Cor Kluis,
ABN AMRO. Go ahead, please.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Cor Kluis

{BIO 3515446 <GO>}

Good morning, and congratulations with the results. Question on slide 18, where you have
to give the split-up of the OCG. We see that the line Life Experience variance, that's
EUR37 million, quite a big plus. Is that COVID-19 related or could you elaborate on that?
And on the same slide, we also see that there is a change of the SCR, which is a beneﬁt of
EUR35 million in the quarter -- in the half-year, you re-risk of course in the portfolio. So
question is what is the re-risking eﬀect because with re-risking, you would have expected
negative eﬀects from that line, so how much did the SCR increase as a result of the rerisking? That's on that slide.
And second question is on capital returns. It's good that you're ﬁnalizing the remaining
part of the share buyback, given the capital position and operational results. What would
be a logical moment to announce a new share buyback, is it really Q4 to review that or
could it also have been little a bit earlier in the year at a certain event or something?
And my last question is on Japan, persistency quite good beneﬁt for the results, of
course. Could you elaborate a little bit more on that? How much of that is structural? It
seems that clients there remain quite persistent in deed and would it mean that the next
couple of quarters these results on an IFRS basis at least would also be so beneﬁcial?
Those were my questions.

A - David Knibbe

{BIO 17996037 <GO>}

Yes, thank you, Cor. Let me start by answering your questions on the capital return and
Japan, and then I'll give the question on slide 18 of Delﬁn's presentation naturally to
Delﬁn.
So on capital return, what will be a logical moment? Well, I wouldn't expect a share
buyback announcement this year on top of what we have already announced today. I
mean, if we look at our capital return policy, we obviously look at three factors there, the
Page 7 of 18



Company Name: NN Group NV
Company Ticker: NN NA Equity
Date: 2020-08-06

Solvency II position, which is strong, our leverage position and our cash on the holding.
And then, of course, we take into account what our outlook is for operating capital
generation, and free cash ﬂow also given the economic circumstances.

FINAL

Earlier, we announced that our capital policy means a minimum of EUR250 million of
share buyback annually. So that one will run oﬀ in the ﬁrst quarter of next year. So the Q4
reporting for 2020 in February of next year would be a logical moment to talk about this.

Q - Cor Kluis

{BIO 3515446 <GO>}

Okay.

A - David Knibbe

{BIO 17996037 <GO>}

That's on capital return. Then on Japan, indeed, we're putting in a lot of eﬀort to keep the
persistency at where it is, so we're issuing at times policy loans. We're doing a lot to
support the portfolio. We're also beneﬁting from the last four, ﬁve years, where we had a
substantial sales and, therefore, we're also able to build a substantial in-force book. I
don't have now any indication that I would expect a major change in the persistency.
With regard to the development of the portfolio, in May, June, July we've seen a more
positive trend on sales and assuming that the economy continues to open up in Japan,
we're optimistic that we can increase the -- also the sales pattern for Japan.

Bloomberg Transcript

And then let me give the question on slide 18 to Delﬁn.

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes, thank you, Cor, for your questions. On the Experience variance, there are several
items but it is mainly the lower claims related to COVID in the Property & Casualty
business, and also some positive deviations due to better longevity results, also related to
COVID. So, most of it is COVID-related. In terms of the change in SCR, please keep in
mind that the change in the -- for the re-risking, which increase our SCR by approximately
EUR175 million. This eﬀect is reﬂected in the bucket Other. So it does not appear as part of
the operating capital generation. Therefore, the EUR35 million relates to the normal runoﬀ of the portfolio mainly in the Netherlands.

Q - Cor Kluis

{BIO 3515446 <GO>}

Okay. Very clear. Thank you.

Operator
The next question is from Mr. Andrew Baker, Citi. Go ahead, please.

Q - Andrew Baker

{BIO 20402705 <GO>}

Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. So just two from me. On the COVID impact, so you
said in June you expected the full-year impact to be EUR100 million on operating proﬁt. It
Page 8 of 18



Company Name: NN Group NV
Company Ticker: NN NA Equity
Date: 2020-08-06

looks like it was EUR30 million in the ﬁrst half. Does that mean we should expect EUR70
million in the second half or is it lower than you expected at the time in June?

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

And then is the impact on OCG just EUR37 million that you just talked about, Delﬁn? And
then secondly just on VIVAT, so it contributed EUR20 million to Non-life results. Are there
any one-oﬀs in this amount? And if not, has your expectations on the beneﬁt of this
transaction changed? Thank you.

A - David Knibbe

{BIO 17996037 <GO>}

Yes, thank you, Andrew. Let me just say a few things about the COVID impact and VIVAT.
And I'm sure Delﬁn can elaborate if needed. So on the guidance, we don't have a reason
to change our guidance on COVID-19. I think we continue to see a relatively limited
business impact there, also due to the way the business is set up. In the EUR30 million for
the ﬁrst half year, we do see a deteriorating trend for a while already in D&A, but so far, it
has been oﬀset by more favorable P&C results. Most of the impact is on lower sales. Keep
in mind that the -- so when we're talking about EUR30 million obviously, the most of the
corona impact was only a quarter. So even though we report here for six months, the most
of the corona impact was mainly in the second quarter and, therefore, we're also not
changing our guidance that we've given at the Capital Markets Day of a EUR100 million
impact.
On VIVAT, indeed, there was a EUR20 million impact in the ﬁrst six months. I think it's fair
to say that the experience so far in its early days is somewhat better than expected. Please
keep in mind that the EUR20 million contribution was also positively impacted by COVID19. The Non-life business of VIVAT has a -- is, to a large extent, a P&C business and the
lockdown have a favorable impact on the claims ratios, mostly in ﬁre and in motor due to
less economic activity. So I wouldn't assume the EUR20 million contribution now as a run
rate going forward. Maybe, Delﬁn, you can add on OCG.

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes, Andrew, on the OCG, you're right that in terms of Experience variance and other
eﬀects like, for example, in OCG indirectly COVID impact of a possibility to pay dividends
out of the Bank. That, as you know, is included when we receive the dividends. The
biggest impact in OCG comes actually through the impact in markets. So the low interest
rates, as you can see also in the same slide 18, increased very substantially the UFR drag.
And on that respect, that is the biggest impact. But otherwise you leave markets impact
aside, the impact on OCG is also relatively similar, slightly higher than the EUR30 million
for the operating result.

Q - Andrew Baker

{BIO 20402705 <GO>}

Great. Thank you very much, guys.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Sorry about that I was on mute. Good morning. Thank you very much for taking my
question. I only had one, which is at the Capital Markets Day, I had the impression -- the
feeling that -- the guidance is a wrong word, but indications for operating capital
generation for 2020 would be around the EUR1 billion. But at the half year, you're already
around EUR543 million, so you're ahead of that. And I'm just wondering if there are any
seasonality to make me think that the second half would be lower? That's my question.
Thank you.

A - David Knibbe

{BIO 17996037 <GO>}

Yes, thank you, Michael. Delﬁn?

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes. Thanks, Michael. No reason to provide any diﬀerent guidance of what we said in the
Capital Markets Day. Of course, the OCG in any particular period has a dependency on
the level of interest rates and spreads over the -- we calculate it based on monthly levels
of the value of our ﬁxed income securities. So it is not just the start of 1st of July that the
term is the investment return, but what are these investment returns every month. So it is
diﬃcult to provide a precise guidance of how this would evolve. But the guidance
provided take at Capital Markets Day is still maintained.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant

Bloomberg Transcript

Brilliant. Thank you very much. Thank you.

Operator
The next question is from Mr. David Barma, Exane. Go ahead, please.

Q - David Barma

{BIO 19957338 <GO>}

Yes, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. The ﬁrst one is on the Dutch Life
earnings and the technical result is pretty strong. You mentioned some mortality beneﬁts
there. I assume that you relating them to COVID speciﬁcally can be tricky, but perhaps can
you give us an idea of what you're seeing in terms of excess mortality on your book
compared to last year or on average?
Then the second question I had was on the investment margin in the operating capital
generation. From what you've shown this morning, the CMD targets of EUR200 million
extra seems relatively close to get to. Is there anything speciﬁc to call out on that
investment margin you disclosed this morning or is that only the impact from the
rebalancing of the asset allocation you've done during the semester or is there maybe
background changes in the risk free curve since the CMD or something like that?
And my last question is on Non-life in the Netherlands. I understand the D&A result is
impacted by COVID-related claims, by the mechanical impact of rates on Disability, and
by the longer time claims inﬂation you're seeing in the Individual Disability. Would it be
Page 10 of 18

possible to split that out for the ﬁrst semester or -- just to get an idea of what's recurring in
there and what's not? Thank you.

A - David Knibbe

{BIO 17996037 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay, thank you, David. Delﬁn, why don't you take the question on Non-life and
investment margin?

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yes. So, the ﬁrst question. Hi, good morning, David. The ﬁrst question on the technical
result in Netherlands Life, this is driven by better longevity results, as well as some the
better morbidity results as well in the ﬁrst half of the year. Of course, the beneﬁts on the
higher mortality or better longevity, we don't expect that, that will continue. As a matter of
fact that we have also seen fortunately that the number of deaths has come into closer to
normal levels within the Netherlands.

Bloomberg Transcript

In terms of the investment margin, the EUR200 million mentioned on the Capital Markets
Day, it is still a good guidance. And of course, this will be changing depending on the
level of the interest rates of the spreads. So in the one hand, we have seen that the
increase of spreads provide some additional investment margin going forward as well as
the re-risking that we have performed so far.
So overall, I don't think there is better guidance that this EUR200 million increase for
2023. In terms of the impact of the investment in higher-yielding assets, that's, of course,
base and we need to take into account this a bit careful based on the spreads and the
level of interest rates at the end of June. This good half already on annualized basis
provide an OCG uplift of more than EUR100 million, approximately EUR120 million. But, of
course, changes in these spreads will come over time as well.

A - David Knibbe

{BIO 17996037 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you, Delﬁn. Then on the D&A result. Indeed, the overall result of the Non-life
company was strong, but if you look then deeper, there are some oﬀsetting eﬀects. We've
seen a continued deterioration of the individual D&A book. This is around 10% of the
premium. We already saw some pressure, mostly in the medical profession on that book,
and now even more in the current situation. We are taking measures on repricing, claim
handling, and making sure that we manage this very eﬃciently also from an expense
perspective. But these measures will take some time to implement.
Now, on the speciﬁc question on a breakdown, I can tell you that the impact of the
discount rate for the D&A, the full D&A company for the ﬁrst half year is around EUR20
million and you would expect a similar amount likely for the second half of the year.
Overall, good to know that despite the upward pressure that we see, because of the
discount rate and COVID and also the individual D&A book that our guidance of 94 to 96
hasn't changed.

Thank you. And if I may just one follow-up on the OCG and the answer you were giving
already, Delﬁn. Could you just remind us the -- on what basis you -- at what points you use
the curve to calculate the UFR drag in the risk margin release, now that you have moved
to half-yearly reporting, is it still the sum of starting period of each quarter?

FINAL

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

So, the calculation of the UFR, the risk margin release, the investment spreads, is all based
on the balances at the end of each month. So in the past, we calculated it based on
quarter per quarter basis, but now as we are reporting for six months on a semester basis,
things changed so much during this period of time. And this year, it has been the clear
example of that. The evolution of markets and interest rates, and the VOLA up to March
changed from ﬁrst quarter to second quarter quite signiﬁcantly. So we do calculate the
operating result, I would say, on a monthly basis on balances on the beginning of the
month.

The next question is from Mr. Jason Kalamboussis, KBC. Go ahead please, sir.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jason Kalamboussis

{BIO 4811408 <GO>}

Yes, hi, good morning. Sorry about that. The ﬁrst thing that I want to ask is just on the -come back a bit on the combined ratio details. So in D&A, you say EUR20 million was
included to get -- that was -- that got your D&A combined ratio to 103%. But could you
give us a sense in percentage points of what is therefore only the deterioration you saw?
And by when do you expect to be back to normally a combined ratio below 95%? And
also if you could give us an idea, I mean, the P&C was very good at 90.8%. Was that
purely driven by COVID or did you had any reserve releases in there? Because also if we
account on the negative eﬀect of CRA, basically that's the third element if you want the
discount that distorts a bit delivery of the 95% combined ratio.
The second thing is just come back on Michael's question on OCG. I mean, if I recall well,
Delﬁn, your words in the Capital Markets Day, you did say that the OCG was going to be
closer to EUR1 billion rather than EUR1 billion. So I would presume that the closer is
coming from EUR1.3 billion, so it can be anything between that and EUR1 billion. So I
would consider that the EUR543 million comes pretty much within your -- that guidance. If
you can conﬁrm that, that would be great. Thank you very much.

A - David Knibbe

FINAL

Yes. So maybe starting with the second question. Indeed, at the Capital Markets Day, we
highlighted the fact that COVID was having a negative impact and also the markets were
dragging down. So overall, I remember saying that it will be closer to the EUR1 billion than
the EUR1.3 billion. And therefore, I can conﬁrm that the EUR543 million is certainly within
that guidance.
On the combined ratio, you're right, Jason. There is a lot of things happening here, and as
a consequence, one has to be interpret it with a bit of care. So indeed, the Property &
Casualty combined ratio of less than 91% is driven in the one hand by a positive
contribution of P&C coming from VIVAT because of the COVID. Also, the rest of the Nonlife business beneﬁting from that. But there was also some releases from reserves in the
Property & Casualty business related to the SME portfolio. So as we said in the press
release, there are several impacts that, at the end, sort of net themselves out. But the
discount rate of the D&A, there is the storm that you mentioned in the ﬁrst quarter and
some of the releases coming from the reserves in the Non-life.
So another aspect to take into account in the Disability & Accident, of course, is that part
of the negative results of Individual Disability are reﬂected in the segment Other through
the reinsurance arrangement with NN Re. If you were to add, let's say, the claims in the
included in the segment Other, the combined ratio would move to approximately 97%, so
approximately 2 percentage points more for the VIVAT -- for the Non-life total combined
ratio.

Q - Jason Kalamboussis

{BIO 4811408 <GO>}

That is very, very helpful. Sorry to just put another little quick question. On the Bank not
paying dividend, do you kind of accrue, that means should we be expecting, for example,
when the banks are able to pay again dividends that we will be receiving, for example,
2020 also the '19 dividend, is that correct assumption? And also did you mention EUR50
million, I think I got 50, but I'm not sure as being the OCG for the ﬁrst half?

A - David Knibbe

{BIO 17996037 <GO>}

Yes, thank you. Yes, indeed 50. Yeah, on the bank, so we are following the guidance here
of the ECB and the DNB. So we don't expect any remittances for this year. We do expect a
catch-up eﬀect over time if and when possible.

Hi. Thank you for the presentation. I have three questions. The ﬁrst one is on the sensitivity
of credit spreads. I actually have a little bit diﬃculty understand that. So you invested a bit
more into the credit, the corporate bonds. However, the sensitivity you disclosed in terms
of the percentage in Solvency II ratio movement is actually becoming more positive in the
credit spreads widening, narrower than fourth quarter last year. But I think the credit
spreads widening should economically be negative to the Solvency Ratio. But previously
you were positive, because I think you underweighed in the corporate bond, but then you
actually invested most. I'm just surprised that the sensitivity is actually getting more
positive. So that's the ﬁrst question.
And the second question is could you just give us a bit of update on the -- what the credit
default downgrade experience you've seen so far and as well as the Dutch Mortgage kind
of default or anything like that? So that's the second question.
And the third one is just so I'm clear, on the OCG of Japan, obviously despite your
decrease in new business, your Japan OCG is relatively stable, presumably because that's
based on the Japan statutory basis. Is it fair to think that as long as the overall book of
Japan remained stable or slightly increased because you're still writing new business, the
OCG should actually increase from here? Thank you.

A - David Knibbe

{BIO 17996037 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Thank you, Fulin. I'll give the ﬁrst two questions to Bernhard and then Delﬁn will
cover the OCG of Japan.

A - Bernhard Kaufmann

{BIO 18347993 <GO>}

Yeah, Fulin. Thank you for your questions. First one, sensitivity of credit spreads. This has
not changed and you're right, this is depending still on our positioning against the
reference portfolio of our EIOPA, where we have underweight in corporate bonds and
overweight in government bonds. And as the sensitivity takes into account, the impact
also of the resulting volatility adjustment of the reference portfolio, you see these two
diﬀerent directions in corporate spreads versus government bond spreads. And that has
not changed compared to the last quarters. And on Dutch mortgages and other credit
default experience in our investment portfolio, we have seen no default events yet. We
saw some rating migrations and also some percentage of our portfolio is impacted by
rating migrations. But that is mainly by one notch and this relates to the large names and
countries. And so we are monitoring this, but that is not a concern until now and Dutch
mortgages in speciﬁcs there we also see a ﬂat trend, so no additional pickup in activity
there.

Q - Fulin Liang

{BIO 21126177 <GO>}

Thank you.

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

And Fulin, on the third question, on the OCG of Japan, which has been relatively stable
compared to the ﬁrst half of '19. This is, as you know, in Japan because of OCG reﬂecting
the increased in solvency under Japanese rules, the more we sell as we have explained in
Page 14 of 18

the past, the lower their operating capital generation because of the new business strain.
So as we expect sales to increase, also now impacted by COVID-19, we would expect that
the sales that will increase over time, and, as a consequence, puts pressure on the current
levels of OCG.

Q - Michele Ballatore

{BIO 17318680 <GO>}

Yes, good morning. Just on cash (inaudible) what is the outlook for 2020, the rest of the
year? I mean is it just the Bank not paying the dividend or in general, you will have a more
prudent approach on this? Thank you.

A - David Knibbe

{BIO 17996037 <GO>}

Delﬁn?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Delﬁn Rueda

{BIO 7032761 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks, Michele. It's not only the Bank that has been aﬀected by the prudent
approach to paying dividends due to the recommendations or the provision from
regulators. So we have also seen this year that aﬀecting, for example, Poland but also
other places like Spain, to some extent Belgium, some of our pension funds. So 2020 will
be somewhat lower in terms of the dividends coming from the business units in Europe
due to the impacts of COVID-19 and the restrictions. Of course, we do expect that things
will normalize over time, also in this part of the free cash ﬂow to the holding company.
For the remainder part of the year, which was also within your question, Netherlands Life
is quite predictable, expect the EUR225 million per quarter. So that is EUR450 million and
then additional EUR30 million coming from the coupon of the hybrids. And then as I said,
in Europe it's more limited. We do not expect that this year we will receive dividend from
the Bank. And Japan has already paid their annual dividend. So that should give you a bit
of a guidance of what to expect in the second half.

Date: 2020-08-06

Yes. Hi. Just a very quick one. Looking at the value of new business and the full that was
relatively large as expected because of COVID, and because of change in Japan, I mean,
if we were to think three years down the road, let's say, so that we don't -- I don't ask the
question, if you're going to dispose of Japan. But is it correct to say that at the end of the
day, if you were, let's say, sales recover, everything is better -- if you were to think about
any disposal of Japan, you would want actually to replace it with M&A that would add to
you -- that would give you new business of an equivalent nature? And in the second kind
of similar question or would you actually be agnostic and it could be like Life or Non-life
i.e. versus other groups like (inaudible) have speciﬁed that their interest in M&A is Nonlife. Do you have that bias or are you agnostic? So...

A - David Knibbe

{BIO 17996037 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you, Jason. I'm not sure I'm going to be very helpful on this answer, but the -- I
don't think it makes a lot of sense to speculate about divesting units and which ones then
we would buy. Our base case we made very clear at the Capital Markets Day is that we
believe in organic growth that we can, not only deliver a operating capital generation of
EUR1.5 billion, but also believe that in the run-up to 2030 that we can grow our operating
capital generation at mid single-digit percentage. So that is our base case. If you would
look at Life, Non-Life, it's fair to say that outside of the Netherlands, our focus has
primarily has been on life and life protection. The Non-life business is -- the big Non-life
business is all in the Netherlands. So that's the situation today.

Your next question is from Mr. Gordon Aitken, RBC. Go ahead, please.

Q - Gordon Aitken

{BIO 3846728 <GO>}

Yeah, thanks very much. So a couple of questions. First, on the three longevity reinsurance
transactions that completed in May 2020, really why now? And given -- I mean, the base
table eﬀect on mortality from COVID is, of course, you know is pretty clear. There is lots of
uncertainty around the future projection. And so why now? And what did the reinsurer
assume in terms of future life expectancy? You don't need to give me any real detail and
it's just but did the reinsurers have no change in life expectancy, life expectancy up or life
expectancy down?
And the second question is if you can just remind us what proportion of your Dutch
pension liabilities are now reinsured for longevity risk? Thank you.

A - David Knibbe

{BIO 17996037 <GO>}

Yes, thank you, Gordon. Bernhard?

FINAL

Company Name: NN Group NV
Company Ticker: NN NA Equity
Date: 2020-08-06

Yeah, Gordon, on ﬁrst the transaction or timing of the transaction, which, of course, is
completely unrelated to COVID-19 and the ongoing pandemic. This mainly goes back to
the longevity risk is our big concentration risk in our portfolio. So from mid-term strategic
perspective, we want to reduce this exposure. We want to have a better diversiﬁed
portfolio also with respect to our insurance risk categories. And that is the main rationale
behind this. So to free up capital that we blocked for this concentration risk and to actively
-- more actively manage this capital position, that's a main motivation for us. And yes, of
course, there are diﬀerent views in the market on how exactly the trend and the
improvement of mortality will develop over time. But the base assumption in the
insurance industry and also in the reinsurance industry is that there will be additional
mortality improvements. There are some, of course, deviating opinions on how exactly
this will look like. But the main point and the main also capital intensity also for this risk
category comes from simply possible adverse developments. And these adverse
developments is what you have to capitalize for and that is where also our current
concentration risk is coming from and that is what the reinsurers are taking over.
And the proportions of the Life liabilities, so it's around 15% of the technical provisions
that we now have reinsured under this ﬁrst transaction sort of give you the magnitude of
the current deal.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Gordon Aitken

{BIO 3846728 <GO>}

Just follow up on what you just said. I mean, I know you said your decision to reinsure
longev risk is unrelated to COVID, but presumably you changed the terms of the
transaction, given COVID has had a massive impact on deaths, and of course, future life
expectancy. And then also even you mentioned obviously the risks with the additional
mortality improvements, and that is the risk, but it certainly hasn't been going that way for
the last 10 years. So what particularly are you concerned about?

A - Bernhard Kaufmann

{BIO 18347993 <GO>}

So no, the negotiations and the preparations for these transactions have been months
with -- started months before the COVID outbreak. And also if you look at the impact of
COVID into the typical insured blocks of businesses, in the Life Insurance books, it's -- yes,
it's an annual impact. It may be two or three years that this has impacted, but this is part of
a typical ﬂuctuation volatility you have to take into account looking into such a long-term
liability and long-term business. And that a pandemic can occur, that's part of the pricing
and also the assessment of a longevity transaction. And so that it's happening now or
happening in 10 or 20 years, well, that's just the timing that we are currently confronted
with, but that's not changing the fundamental view and also the pricing assumptions for
these transactions.
