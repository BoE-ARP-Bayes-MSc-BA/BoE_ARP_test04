Operator
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Storebrand conference analyst
call. My name is Anna, and I will be your coordinator for today's conference. For the
duration of the call, you will be on listening-only. However, at the end of the presentation,
you have opportunity to ask questions.
I will now hand you over to Kjetil Krøkje to begin today's conference. Thank you.

Kjetil Ramberg Krøkje
Yes. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Storebrand's First Quarter 2016
Conference Call. My name is Kjetil Ramberg Krøkje, and I'm Head of Investor Relations at
Storebrand. Together with me today, I have Group CEO, Odd Arild Grefstad; CFO, Lars
Løddesøl; Finance Director, Sigbjørn Birkeland; and Head of Economic Capital, Trond
Finn Eriksen.
In the presentation today, Odd Arild will give an overview of the development in the
quarter and Lars will give some more detail on some of the elements in the results. The
slides will be similar to the analyst presentation released this morning and are available
on our webpage. After the presentation, the operator will open up for questions. To be
able to ask questions, you will need to dial into the conference call.
I will now leave the word to Storebrand's CEO, Odd Arild Grefstad, who will start the
presentation on slide two.

Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Thank you, Kjetil. I will describe Storebrand's ﬁrst quarter result as good in a turbulent
market. The group result before amortization and write-downs was NOK 546 million for
the quarter. It is aﬀected in particular by good ﬁnancial returns in the company portfolios,
strong results within asset management and strong cost control. The growth within capital
light savings is still strong and the unit linked premium growth is 29% since the same
quarter last year. The growth within insurance is also good with 8% compared to ﬁrst
quarter last year.
The growth within retail bank has really picked up with 18% retail lending growth
compared to ﬁrst quarter 2015. And an estimated Solvency II ratio of the ﬁrst quarter is
175%. I'll get back to this in more detail later.
Then let's move to slide number three. This is a well known slide, although still relevant.
The value creation in Storebrand comes through growth in non-guaranteed savings and
insurance and through handling the guaranteed balance which is in a long-term runoﬀ.

Bloomberg Transcript

In slide number four, we see that the dealing with the paid up policy portfolio is central as
a part of the management or our guaranteed business. We have divided our guaranteed
paid up policies in four sub portfolios. Three of these portfolios has 60% to 90%
allocation to bonds at amortized costs.
In today's low interest rate environment, the held to maturity portfolio secures a long-term
expected return above (03:23) the interest rate guarantee. In fact, the excess value of
these bonds is now at NOK 12 billion which contributes to increased book (03:34) return
in the years ahead.
And we are still able to add to this portfolio. And so far this year, we have built NOK 3
billion in new investments at 3.2% yield and 14 years average life. In total, this means that
we have an investment portfolio that exceeds the interest guarantee in the years ahead.
If we then move to slide number ﬁve, the Solvency II position in Storebrand has been
strengthened by 7 percentage points in – to 175% in the quarter. The reduced interest
rates are to a largest extent reﬂected in increased transitionals. While the 7 percentage
points increase is caused by results generation and improved asset allocation. The
solvency margin excluding transitional rules is 117%, a 7-percentage point decrease from
last quarter.
If we then move to slide number six, looking at this simpliﬁed view of the movement from
fourth quarter to ﬁrst quarter, we see that the results generation in ﬁrst quarter has
improved solvency with about 3 percentage points. In addition, we have reduced the
equity and real estate exposure in the paid up policies.
In total, the derisk and asset allocation have improved the solvency position by 4
percentage points. Financial market movements have reduced the underlying solvency by

FINAL

about 14 percentage points, of which, 12 percentage points to 13 percentage points from
lower interest rates and the rest from weak equity markets and other conditions.
If we then move to slide number seven, the growth within non-guaranteed savings and
insurance continues. As mentioned, the unit linked premium growth was 29%. However,
the growth in unit linked reserves was a more moderate 8% compared to ﬁrst quarter last
year. The reserve development was dampened by negative equity markets. In unit linked
Norway, about 50% of the allocation is into equities while about 75% in unit linked
Sweden.
The challenging market commission also have aﬀected the reserve development within
asset management in the quarter. However, the underlying growth rate is still good. As I
mentioned earlier, the growth rate within insurance is good. However, it is somewhat
normal rate than in earlier quarters. The reason for this include the fact that we are
replacing expensive external distribution with more cost eﬀective internal distribution.
Internal distribution also allows for more cross sales. This shift in the distribution mix is
expected to dampen the insurance growth in the next quarters.

Bloomberg Transcript

Last but not least, it is very satisfying to see that we are succeeding within retail banking.
Retail banking is instrumental to our success in the private market strategy, not least
because of the cross-selling we experience based on our banking relationship.
If we then move to slide number eight, we see that the development within Storebrand
asset management is very strong. And in this quarter, we have booked a result of NOK
130 million. We have built an eﬀective and scalable asset management business. And in
the last few years, we have succeeded combining a strong top line growth with reduced
costs. This has led to a doubling of the result from asset management since 2012.
Sustainability is at the core of our asset management and we see now that our position as
one of the world's leading sustainable asset managers contributes to our commercial
success.
Slide number nine. The sum of all these is that we continue to shift from guaranteed
products to non-guaranteed savings. The income from our guaranteed business is
declining. Public EV (08:12) and corporate banking is in runoﬀ, and migration from the
fund beneﬁt to lower margin paid up policies reduces fee and administration income.
However, thanks to the strong growth within savings segment, we are able to grow total
fee and administration income. The shift in our business is illustrated well by the graph on
the right-hand side where we see that the reduction in guaranteed income is more than
compensated for by the growing income in savings.
Then I leave the word to Lars Løddesøl.

Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
Hello, everybody, and good afternoon. Then I would like you to bring your attention to
page 10 with key ﬁgures. Last quarter, I spent a considerable amount of time explaining a
Page 3 of 14

lot of extraordinary items. This quarter, there are very few. The one special item that we
would like to highlight is the NOK 73 million shown on the upper left-hand side which is
the proﬁt that we got from the sale of Storebrand Baltic as we discussed also in the
previous quarter.
That leaves an underlying result, the result before proﬁt sharing and loan losses of NOK
605 million which is a good (09:35) earnings. The net proﬁt sharing and loan losses of
minus NOK 133 million is negatively impacted by negative proﬁt ﬁt in the Swedish
guaranteed operation as a consequence of the falling interest rate level. Earnings per
share were NOK 0.93 in the quarter after tax. Solidity capital is maintained at the high
level, and customer buﬀers are – continues to be satisfactory although customer buﬀers in
the Swedish operation has been negatively impacted by the falling interest rates.

Bloomberg Transcript

Moving over to slide number 11. Fee and administration income is slightly up from last
year. If we normalize or if we consider currency movements as well as discontinued
business, the underlying development is 1.8%, up from last year, which means that we
managed to replace the revenues that we lose from the guaranteed back book with a
stronger growth in the front book as Odd Arild just talked about.
The risk result life and pension is at NOK 24 million improved by a one-oﬀ reinsurance
contract gain of NOK 20 million. This result line will gradually go away as a new disability
pension in the public system in Norway will decrease the coverage that we've previously
recorded under this line. So this will go towards zero and will be removed in due course,
or the result line will be removed in due course. Insurance premiums and claims for own
account shows a slight improvement of NOK 4 million from last year. Operational cost
seems ﬂat, but the Swedish krona has strengthened since last year. There is an underlying
improvement of NOK 27 million from the ﬁrst quarter last year. This is somewhat better
improvement that we expect for the rest of the year. So we will have some double cost
relating to the covenants and contract that we entered into in the last quarter which will
give us double cost through the course of 2016 and signiﬁcant savings in 2017 and 2018.
The ﬁnancial result is positively impacted by a good return on company portfolios in
Norway and Sweden, and that partly oﬀsets bad returns in the second half of last year
where we had widening of spreads, credit spreads. These have contracted in this quarter
and given us a gain somewhat higher than we expect going forward. This number also
includes the gain of NOK 73 million from the sale of Storebrand Baltic as I mentioned on
the previous slide.
And the net proﬁt sharing and loan losses, as I mentioned, the main part of the minus
NOK 133 million comes from the guaranteed business in Sweden. And it is caused (12:55)
by the falling interest rates during the course of the quarter. However, we have also,
during the course of the quarter, reduced the – or practically eliminated the duration
mismatch in this portfolio. And we expect less sensitivity and less volatility in this number
going forward.
Moving over to page 14. Page 14, on the lower right-hand side, show how we grow the
retail bank and how we managed to place a lot of those new loans on the life balance

sheet. This gives us – this gives strong capital eﬃcient investments in the life company.
And the lending rate is beneﬁcial for our banking clients and fuels the growth in lending
in the bank. So this is a good way to use the strength of the synergies that we have within
the group.
Then I would like you to turn to page 18. And on the lower left-hand side of the page 18,
we have the buﬀer capital. And you will see the ﬂip side of the falling interest rates is the
fact that the excess value of bonds at amortized cost increased in value. So the falling
interest rates weakened somehow or somewhat the solvency ratio and – but it also gives
very good reserve strengthening in excess bond – value of bonds at amortized cost which
again gives us a stronger buﬀer to pull from if rates continue to stay at these lower levels.
Furthermore, I would like to draw your attention to the unallocated results. We have
created almost $1 billion in unallocated results. That will be used to continue to close the
remaining gap of – in longevity reserve strengthening as well as strengthening of the
capital – sorry, of the customer buﬀers at the end of the year when this is fully allocated
down on the individual contracts.
And that concludes my brief walking through some of the main numbers.

Thank you, Lars and Odd Arild. The operator will now open up for Q&A.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. The ﬁrst questions come from Matti Ahokas from Danske Bank. Please go
ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. It's Matti here from Danske Bank. Two questions please. Firstly, in
the press conference earlier today, I think, Odd Arild, you were talking about the dividend
and especially that the solvency margin had increased obviously because of the
increasing interest rates in the second quarter already. Just for clarity's sake, could you
repeat what you said regarding the potential dividend payout for 2016? I guess you
mentioned something about that.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Yes. We have talked with that (16:26). On that question, I just said that during the second
quarter and the movements we have seen in the market, we should expect that our
solvency ratio without transitional is back same level that we had at the end of last year.
That's around 124 percentage points. And based on that, based on the strong numbers
altogether, of course, I just alluded to what the board said in the ﬁrst quarter, in fourth

Page 5 of 14

quarter, and of course, this gives a good view on the year and our expectation is, as the
board said, to pay a dividend for 2016 and 2017.

FINAL

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Great. That's very clear. The second question is regarding the unit linked business. See,
there was a very strong inﬂow on the retail side in Norway but also the margins were also
very strong in Norway on the unit linked overall. Were there any one-oﬀs or kind of
unusual impact in the ﬁrst quarter unit linked Norway ﬁgures?

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Let me try, Matti. On the fee margins, we usually book a fee for some paper-based
handling in the ﬁrst and third quarter. So we usually have a little bit higher margins in the
ﬁrst and third quarters. The inﬂows in unit linked is just the sale both to our – or cross-sells
to our pension customers for the most part.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.

Operator

Bloomberg Transcript

The next questions come from Peter Eliot from Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead. Your
line is now open.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you very much. I had a couple of questions focusing on the paid up policy
development actually. You've been guiding, I think, to sort of NOK 8 billion a year in
terms of transfers into paid up, but the run rate was sort of ahead of that in Q1. And I think
you said on slide ﬁve, looks like you're expecting north of NOK 7 billion across the rest of
the year. I'm just wondering if whether your view on that has changed. And in particular,
your view of sort of where the balance might sort of top out, starts to plateau because I
think we're sort of approaching the level that you've guided to in the past.
And perhaps on that, just in terms of the transfers that you have made, could you perhaps
comment – I'm guessing the capital requirement of those is substantially lower than the
paid up policies that were already in force. I'm wondering if you could just comment on
that. And also whether there was any sort of residual requirements? I'm guessing (19:30)
in the line, but just whether we should expect any sort of a topping out of longevity
reserves. I mean I know you've done everything that you sort of thought you need at the
end of the year, but I wasn't clear whether if some policies transferred across were on an
individual level based on these topping out whether there was anything that might not –
still need to be done there.
Thank you.

FINAL

Yes. On the – thank you, Peter. This is Lars. On the development of paid up, in the ﬁrst
quarter last year, we had NOK 5.3 billion converting. The ﬁrst quarter this year, we had
NOK 3.9 million. So the trend is deﬁnitely going down. And the ﬁrst quarter is always the
bigger quarter in terms of what happens because some of these hard closes typically
happens at year end.
So we expect the number to readily go down. We have previously guided on
approximately NOK 8 billion for the year as a whole, and we maintained that guiding.
However, there is a certain uncertainty around that number relating to some large
corporate contracts which may close this year. They may close next year. They may soft
close, and they may hard close. So there will be a couple of billions that could go in each
like either above or below the NOK 8 billion that we have guided.
In terms of capital requirements, for new paid up policies, you are right in assuming that
they are generally at a lower level. They would fully result for long life, and they will
typically be at the lower average guarantee.
And last, for longevity, as we have said, we'll take in the bulk of longevity reserve
strengthening. And while there may be some smaller contribution of individual paid up
policies with investment choice, this will be not material either in this quarter or in the
quarters ahead of us. So – and with the strong unallocated result that I mentioned
previously, we will have more than suﬃcient return at – as of this stage to fully cover the
remaining longevity reserve strengthening while excess return in customer portfolios.

The next question is coming from Paul De'Ath from RBS (sic) [RBC] (22:01). Please go
ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Paul De'Ath
Yeah. Hi, there. Just a couple of questions from me please. Firstly, on the unit linked
reserves of the – up on Q1 last year but they're slightly down on the full year 2015. And so,
over the quarter, I think there was a signiﬁcant other move in Sweden which accounts for
most of the change. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about what was driving
that.
And then secondly was just on the solvency ratio. Do you have any thoughts or anything
you want to share with us on the potential impact of a change in the level of the UFR
(22:51) going forward? That would be great. Thanks.

A - Operator

Page 7 of 14



Company Name: Storebrand ASA
Company Ticker: STB NO Equity
Date: 2016-04-27

FINAL

Yeah. (22:57) I'll start with the unit linked reserves. The development in the unit linked
reserves are highly dependent of course on the equity markets as 50% of the Norwegian
book is in equities and about 25% of the Swedish book is in equities. So the bulk of the
exchange from year end to now has come from negative equity markets which in the
movement panels (23:28) you alluded to, a lot of that is in other due to some translation
diﬀerences and other factors. But it's basically negative equity return. Yeah.
And if you look at the solvency ratio, ﬁrst of all, of course, there is a proposal now out
there around year four (23:47). We are also expecting to give our views into that proposal.
One element, of course, is that we will see Norway, we have an expectation of inﬂation of
2.5% compared to the 2% used in the European Central Bank. And then also, of course, is
very much impact on the actual interest rate levels. So, with this proliferation of the
interest rate levels we have seen over this quarter and also so far this quarter, we are
following this close and we expect to be able to give you much more insight in the
solvency situation, and also, this sensitivity when we come back to you on our Capital
Markets Day in May 13.

Q - Paul De'Ath
Okay. Thanks.

And the next questions come from Jonny Urwin from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Hi, there. Good afternoon. Thanks for (24:51-24:57)
Hello?

Operator
I am so sorry, Jonny. Could you please repeat that again? Your line was muted for a while
there.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Okay, sure. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
Hi.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

I'd just like to go to slide six. Thanks for the disclosure around the Solvency II capital
generation in the quarter. It's interesting that you disclosed it as results which I assume is
Page 8 of 14

FINAL

earnings and other. And that's the three points of accretion in the quarter. So I'd be
interested to hear what is the other and what is the split? Obviously, just trying to think
about one annual number might be for your solvency capital generation. I know you're
probably going to touch on that on May 13, but it would just be very interesting to hear
your thoughts around that.
Also, the second question is around the derisking actions that you've done on the capital
requirements. So – I mean does that have any impact on the future proﬁts or the future
capital generation sort of capacity of the group? So I imagine if you're derisking now, then
you're taking away some proﬁts. I imagine it's not for free, but any comments around that
would be much appreciated. Thanks.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks, Jonny. We could split it into somewhat more detail for you. Partly, there is a model
improvement and I'll explain exactly what that is. When you have asset-backed securities,
you can either model them just as an asset-backed security or you can actually model also
the assets that actually backs the security, i.e., the security they have behind. That is a
model improvement which improves the solvency ratio according to the rules set by the
EIOPA and included in the solvency regulations.
There is certain elements of improved pricing involving these elements. And there is the –
on the derisked and changed asset allocation, there is the fact that we continue to match
liabilities and assets in sub portfolios to make them more manageable from a solvency
perspective. And we also invest in new asset classes like asset-backed securities like the
retail lending that I mentioned on the call earlier today. That improves the capital
eﬃciency of the investments.
And last but the least, on the results and others, obviously, the additional returns that we
have achieved during the quarter as well as the hard capital that we've been to (27:42). So
we are not losing any signiﬁcant part of future proﬁt as a consequence of this. This is more
and more tailored way to manage solvency both on the modeling and in the actual asset
liability matching.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Okay. So that's a lot of the derisking actions then. But on – and I suppose the other in the
results line. But what's the split between the earnings and those other actions because it
sounds like a lot of that is one-oﬀ in nature but perhaps in terms of the initial beneﬁt now,
but just in terms of the ongoing ﬂow of capital, what do you think comes from earnings?

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

I think what you see of course is that you have the real equity generation you have had in
this quarter. And we also heard Lars say that it was around NOK 1 billion in allocated
result. And a large part of that will be used to cover up for the small remaining part of the
longevity restoration. And that in a solvency view is taken into account as a possible use of
equity and by creating these kind of values that is helpful for market value creation
actually. So all of these elements together is adding up to this 3%. Then – and it is higher
Page 9 of 14



Company Name: Storebrand ASA
Company Ticker: STB NO Equity
Date: 2016-04-27

than you should expect, of course, in a quarter-by-quarter result generation. And we are
planning to give more insight again in the Capital Markets Day of expected value creation
and solvency creation on an annual basis as such.

FINAL

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Okay. I mean I guess I was assuming sort of 5 points to 8 points of solvency capital
generation. So I'm just wondering if that's too low (29:46).

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

I don't think. We're not going to give a number of solvency capital generation today,
Jonny, but...

And the next question comes from Blair Stewart from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Your line is now open.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thank you very much. I've got a couple of questions left but one of them was asking
about capital generation, so I'm not sure I'll bother asking it now. But I think it would be
useful at the Capital Markets Day to see all the moving parts because clearly you've got
your earnings coming through. You've got the unwinding of the transitionals every year
which is going to be something like NOK 900 million a year which is a big number and
you've got the increase in the paid up book which has a capital charge attached to it as
well. So I would be very interested to see how that breaks down and certainly the 3 points
that you've shown us is a high number relative to certainly what I have with regards to
ongoing capital generation. But I'll leave that now. I don't expect you to comment further.
The other question I had was referring to the loss absorbing tax number which is NOK 4.6
billion. I just wonder if you can give a bit more color behind how that's derived and what

Page 10 of 14



Company Name: Storebrand ASA

period of recoverability you'd be assuming, et cetera, if there's any detail you can give
there. Maybe that's another question for the 13th but I'd be interested to know.

FINAL

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

If I might try to answer that, Blair, I think you can have more details on that on the Capital
Markets Day. But just to give you some color, (31:38) for our European life insurance. The
average tax absorbing capacity for European groups was 19% on the solvency ratios.
What we have done is to see how the balance sheet will look after a number of stresses.
And we have seen to what extent it's probable, that future taxable proﬁts will be available
against those losses. We have documented that quite thoroughly. On that behalf, we think
we can in December taking other ﬁelds (32:25) tax loss absorbing capacity into the
calculations.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

So sorry, did you say it was 19 points for the other companies that you studied?

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Yeah. That was in the increased ﬁve (32:40) study published by (32:41) back in 2011, I
guess.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Okay. And I think yours is about 16 points, isn't it?

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Yeah. Something like that.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay. Maybe I can come back to one of the points that was made earlier with regards to
the risk result. I think you said it was going to go to zero over time. I just wonder if you can
help us ﬁgure out where in the segmented breakdown of proﬁts that might appear and
how long will it take for that number to go to zero? Thank you.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Yeah. On the risk result line, the Norwegian risk results from the life and pension which is
now in the guaranteed segment, that is expected to be very low going forward partly
because the new disability legislation which moves a lot of this over to the insurance
segment and partly because the remaining risk result will be used to build buﬀers which
are much more eﬃcient under Solvency II.
The risk results that then remain are the risk results from SPP and our subsidiary called
BenCo which is in the other segment. So those risk results will remain but we will perhaps
not report them on a separate line in the table.

And in the Norwegian part of the business, it's not that the result disappears. It just shifts
over to the insurance segment instead of having been on this risk result line.

And we do have another question from Peter Eliot from Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go
ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you. We're talking small numbers here a little bit. But I just want to perhaps clarify
on the Solvency II ratio with transitional rules, the 7 percentage points of solvency
generation across the quarter basically translated to full year into the increase in 168% to
175%. So net of ﬁnancial markets and the transitional rules fully oﬀset those. I guess that
was a little bit of surprise given that part of the impact would have been from equity
markets where the transitionals don't fully oﬀset. And I guess there's a small amount of
amortizing of the transitional rules.
So I was just wondering if you could comment perhaps on whether that's really been sort
of completely steady or whether the numbers I'm talking about are just sort of too small to
notice. And secondly on the derisking, I was just wondering if you could comment how
much further – how much more scope do you see to take further actions there? Thank
you.

When it comes to the transitional, Peter, that goes – the transitional is mainly made up
from the diﬀerence between the Solvency I values of the liabilities for our paid up policies
and the Solvency II values. Our falling interest rates have quite sharply increased the
Solvency II liabilities for the paid up policies which is still (36:24) the main reason why this
has been increased during the quarter. Then it's very diﬃcult to exactly pinpoint those –
all the diﬀerent moving parts. But what do you actually see this quarter is that the
transitional measures more than compensate for the total eﬀects.

I think you also have of course falling equity market, but there has also been a lower
charge on equities based on the rules from EIOPA. Yeah. On the derisking, Peter, I guess
we could always derisk more and get a higher solvency ratio today. But that is an ongoing
risk reward assessment made by the investment team and the Solvency II team.

FINAL

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
What you see we have done this quarter is to still add on into the health maturity bond
portfolio and we are able to buy bonds at high quality. That covers up very much for the
period now for 2020 to 2030 and are still well above the guaranteed level this year
(37:45). That of course is derisking the portfolios. It reduces the opportunities for proﬁt
sharing in the years to come. But it of course quite epic, they also (37:56) reduces the
downside risk in the paid up policy portfolio. And you should expect us to look for these
opportunities also going forward.

And we did one straight away from Blair Stewart from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Your line is now open.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thank you. I'm just wondering what assets are you bringing on to the books with a – was it
14-, 15-year duration and a 3.2% yield?

Blair, that is typically a single A rated bond. One example would be an international
insurance company, there are also some international agencies that issue debt that we
have bought in the quarter. So that is typically the kind of bonds we have been looking at
this quarter.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
I don't remember that we (39:11) swap it back into Norwegian, so we have the Norwegian
interest in the bottom.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Yeah. So you're swapping that back into Norwegian?

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Yeah.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

And does the 3.2% include the cost of the swaps?

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
Yes.
