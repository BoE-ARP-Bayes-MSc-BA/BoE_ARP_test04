MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Allianz Conference Call on the
Financial Results for the Second Quarter of 2016. For your information, today's conference
is being recorded.
At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Oliver Schmidt, Head of
Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.

Oliver Schmidt

{BIO 2473131 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you, Suzanne. Good afternoon from my side as well and welcome to our
conference call about the results of the second quarter 2016. There's nothing speciﬁc to
be added from my side today. So, without further ado, I hand over directly to Dieter.

Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you very much, Oliver, and also a warm welcome from my side to our second
quarter results call. I dive directly into the presentation. I hope you have it all open in front
of you. So I start on page three, ﬁrst discussing the overview of the six months ﬁgures.
Group revenues, €64.8 billion, minus 4.7% adjusted for currency movement and
acquisition disposal. It is a 2.5% decline in revenues driven by our Life and Health

segment which on the internal measurement reduced 6.5%; P&C is up 3.1%; and Asset
Management is declining more than 9%.
That resulted into an operating proﬁt of €5.1 billion for the half year. That is roughly 49% of
our €10.5 billion target for the year which we, by the way, conﬁrm and stick to. Our net
income was €3.3 billion, is 14.5% lower than last year. However, when you look at the full
year 2015, we are, after six months in 2016, exactly on half of last year's proﬁt. That means
for the people who are always doing the little calculation on the dividend, we are, at the
moment, at least on last year's level, which I think is a great starting point for the second
half of the year.
Combined ratio is up against last year and, in particular, it worsened substantially in the
second quarter due to – well, actually, normal insurance volatility. I will talk about it in
more detail. New business margin continues the trend of the previous quarters. Our new
strategy is manifesting it in substantially higher new business margin despite the low yield
environment.

Bloomberg Transcript

Cost-income ratio for Asset Management is shown ﬂat six months over six months, but
actually we are making nice forecast in the second quarter, also a good story to talk about
later on the detailed slide.
So, with this one, let's go into the second quarter. Certainly, below €2.4 billion operating
proﬁt is not the number you and also us were hoping for. However, there are good
reasons that we are where we are. The whole drop is in the P&C segment. Life and Health
is actually nicely up. Asset Management stabilizing even over 2Q 2015, actually up 8%
against Q1 and, the rest, it's a normal – little noise around the corporate segment and
consolidation.
Net income almost cut in half, driven by the lower operating proﬁt, factor number one.
Factor number two, recognizing an anticipated disposals loss using the IFRS 5 accounting
rules for Korea of €352 million. And, number three, additional impairments on equity
investments coming from the volatility of the Brexit mess after end of June.
So, when we now go to the balance sheet, actually shareholders equity is further up. Not
surprisingly, our unrealized gains and losses got a real boost with low-yield environment.
And actually, also, our unrealized gains in the equity portfolio is unchanged, but we had
to recognize on a gross basis €1 billion write-downs on our equity investments.
Solvency II capitalization, 186%. So we focused not only on the Life segment, but also
keeping in this volatile times the Solvency II capitalization in good shape was clearly one
of the focus areas. And when we go to the next chart on page nine, then let me explain
what special actions did we do which were not, I think, not obvious in the normal
sensitivities announced.
First of all, we did hedge or sell some banking exposure in April. But also, we hedged all
currency exposures we had from the British pounds in all other balance sheet which are
non-pound denominated. And then, we did additional credit spread hedges on some
Page 2 of 24

FINAL

more southern government bonds. So that helped us actually that we could keep our own
funds very stable because when you look at the own funds development, the little pluses
and minuses between the various segments ended up in total with zero impact of the
market impact. So, certainly, lower interest rates were compensated by falling credit
spreads and our long credit bond investments helped us in the quarter. And in the
derisking, there was only small that was mainly a reduction of bank equity which created
the little reduction in risk capital.
The operating Solvency II earnings are lower than in the ﬁrst quarter and probably you are
asking, well, that is again a volatile number, in particular the Life segment has some ups
and downs, and the up and down is coming from operating experience or operating
assumption changes in combinations or mainly operating experience. I would say when
you take the half year ﬁgure, then the half year ﬁgure is probably a good combination.
That means instead of the four points of capital generation you see here on the chart, we
had 9% in Q1. I would probably use somewhere in the middle between the two. So, let's
say, around 6% as a good average between the two numbers. So that is the main
explanation why we stick to 186%, and I think it is a good work of the risk and investment
team that we ran through these diﬃcult times fairly untainted.

Bloomberg Transcript

P&C, actually, good growth, internal growth accelerated to a 3.7%. That is half a point
more than in Q1. Good basic growth in Germany and France, Allianz Worldwide Partners.
Spain continues to perform excellently because in Spain most of the increase is still price,
that is actually a very good development. And then, two markets, which are not
individually shown here is Turkey, where we still grow market share and also, Argentina,
where we take rates as recovery for last year's substantial underperformance.
When we go now to the combined ratio, that is hopefully the story we will discuss in the
Q&A afterwards the longest, quite a drop in operating proﬁt for the P&C segment.
Actually, in all three areas, the area Other is easy explained. We had last year in this
category shown the one-oﬀ coming from the disposal of Fireman's Fund. So that was a
€200 million gain. So that obviously is not being repeated this year. Investment is mainly
falling interest rates reduction and also capital upstreaming to the censor, therefore, less
investment income allocated to the segment P&C.
And now the underwriting results. Quarter-over-quarter, we have an increase of 3 points
in the combined ratio. The 3 points could be explained at face value with the increase in
cat losses. We had €500 million this quarter. Last year, it was some €120 million, €130
million. So that is a simple explanation. But as we have also an increase in the run-oﬀ ratio
by another 3 points, there are still 3 points missing.
So we have – besides the cat loss increase, we have actually also an increase in other manmade losses. So the large losses are more than 1 point up, plus we have additional smaller
weather-related events which are not included in the cat deﬁnition. So I would say the net
increase quarter-over-quarter last year is about 60 basis points, 70 basis points in
underlying attritional loss, a number I would have not liked to talk to you about because I
was still conﬁdent that we could compensate the markets which obviously had a tough
environment like Italy, the credit insurance but also our large corporate business and our
assumption was that the rest would make up for it. But we are behind the curve, again, in
Page 3 of 24



Company Name: Allianz SE

Date: 2016-08-05

our development in Latin America. So that is the main driver, I think, which makes
probably most of the 60 basis points.

FINAL

So it is a delay, but still thinking that's getting to the 94% by 2018, with recovery in loss
ratios but also with more work on the expense ratio, which is at the moment more
showing the eﬀects of additional investment instead of reduction, is probably a fair
assumption.
So when you go on page 15, into the detailed page, there you can see actually which
countries were mainly hit by catastrophe events. Germany, it was a series of bad
spring/summer weather events; France, the same, ﬂoods and hailstorms. Not here on the
list, Belgium and Netherlands, aﬀected by the same series or similar series of events. Our
Global Corporate business has some European damage, but also a little bit of the
Japanese earthquake, a piece of the Canadian bush ﬁre, and also of the hailstorm in
Wylie, Texas. But probably we will talk about it later more.

Bloomberg Transcript

So I would now go to the investment area. I said already investment income for P&C
down. The reduction is a little bit smaller average asset base, that is reduction you see on
– shown in the bubbles, plus a reduction in yields which you can see on the right-hand
side which is very much expected in this environment. I think we are still doing a very
good job on keeping the reinvestment yield at a 2% level which is a good number.
Certainly, we have increased slightly the duration in our P&C segment also to keep the
yield up.
So moving to Life. Actually, page 19 is an excellent proof point that our Life strategy is
working, that we can adjust to the current market environment. Volume-wise, in the
second quarter, we are almost catching up with a strong year, strong quarter in 2015. And
the main contributors in growth are actually Germany and the U.S.
We see a reduction in business. Well, we have – ﬁrst of all, we have excluded Korea from
the operating numbers because we move Korea to non-operating. But also, we see a
drop in our new business volume in Taiwan that is a unit-linked business and unit-linked
market was substantially smaller in Taiwan as customers are more nervous about equity
volatility in this part of the world. So that explains also why the category unit-linked
without guarantees was smaller where the category capital-eﬃcient products that is
mainly U.S. and Germany are substantially up. That is also – well, the new business is
actually not resulting in a good operating proﬁt because we have still, coming out of the
new business, roughly €100 million loss from the new business written in the speciﬁc
quarter. So that is always included in the overall operating proﬁt.
Operating proﬁt at €1 billion. This is a good and extraordinary number. No, I think it has
normalized in a lot of categories. But Korea is excluded as we aﬃrm that we are – that
disposal of Korea will be completed during the year. And the investment margin which is
slightly up, that is mainly Germany, that is normalizing an ultralow investment margin we
had in the second quarter at 2015. So, actually, it is a pretty good picture of the earnings
power of the Life segment at Allianz. So when I go to new business, also new business
generation is at a very good level, that is enough value generation, actually took place in

Page 4 of 24

Date: 2016-08-05

the operating proﬁt maturing business. And I think we are on a good track with our overall
outlook for the Life segment.

FINAL

Page 25 is the usual page on demonstrating how audit guarantee move, how much yield
are we still producing. I think that is more the proof point that the guarantees are not
biting, that there is still enough for the customer and also the shareholder coming from
the investment returns.
So let's move over to Asset Management. Sure, assets under management, 5 points up.
Outﬂows at PIMCO, €18 billion; at Allianz Global Investors, €1 billion, compensated by
market movement which makes 2%; FX also 2%; and other is ﬁrst time integration of the
Rogge acquisition of roughly €30 billion assets, leading to the overall €1.3 trillion ﬁgure.

Bloomberg Transcript

The outﬂows at PIMCO, higher than in Q1. But we are still sticking to our statements that
we are expecting a zero number for the second half year of 2016. Actually, when I gave
the message in May, the outﬂow of €18 billion at PIMCO was already known because it
happened very much in the beginning of April. We had institutional money of €17 billion
leaving the door. And the rest of the quarter and all customers together generated just
minus €1 billion, which I think is a very good conﬁrmation for the direction overall.
The margin in Asset Management are holding up. We are even a little bit higher than
actually in the ﬁrst quarter, but that is the usual story about the number of fee base. So I
would say it is unchanged level to Q1. And, therefore, we see actually in the operating
proﬁt an unchanged ﬁgure to a year ago and a slight positive ﬁgure or actually a good
positive development against Q1. Operating proﬁt in Q2 is 8% higher than in Q1, mainly
driven from PIMCO.
The non-personnel expenses at PIMCO has reduced. PIMCO had a 62% cost-income ratio
in the second quarter. We still have some of the special retention package we created
after Bill Gross' departure, so 18 months ago. When I take this booking out, then we would
be at 61.1% cost-income ratio for the second quarter. So, actually, I think we are also here
on a good track for development in the direction of 60%, as we have stated as one of our
2018 targets.
And with this one, I'm coming already to the end of the operating proﬁt story. Corporate
segment, almost no movement against last year. We are now back to a normal quarter.
The ﬁrst quarter had a special eﬀect from own pension transfers already at a year ago. We
are now here at a normal quarter. Therefore, when we take the ﬁrst half year, take the oneoﬀ out, we are very much on track with our overall operating outlook for the year.
So summary page showing the translation from operating proﬁt to net income. I would
really like to spend ﬁrst a minute on Korea. We have signed the sales agreement to
Anbang on April 6 and decided that we would show the business from April 6 on as nonoperating as we are working with the buyer on actually execution. The transfer, we had
also agreed with them certain changes, we managed for them already in the company
that is restructuring, but also agreements with the trade unions and so on. Therefore, I
think it is really an entity which is not anymore being run as Allianz-managed company.

FINAL

So, the IFRS 5 rules, when you move something as held-for-sale, is a quite complicated
standard. Therefore, we could impair all non-current asset in the balance sheet of the
Korean subsidiary that is in total €209 million and that means there is no other noncurrent assets left in the balance sheet.
Additionally, the operating losses, which we crystallized in the second quarter of €250
million, plus the tax eﬀect, brings us in total to €352 million net impact. And this number
brings us fairly close to the result when the disposal is then ﬁnalized after all regulatory
approvals have been progressed. So that is a complex process, but I'm not the owner of
the IFRS rules. We are only the owner of the execution of the IFRS rules, and that we have
done according to textbook.

Bloomberg Transcript

So the other important number to mention is, besides Korea, we had more impairments
coming from the equity markets. Even if the markets after the Brexit referendum, after
some volatility, recovered quite well, actually the tax was quarter-over-quarter only down
3% or 4% while actually the FTSE 100 was even up. The market movement of individual
stocks showed much more volatility. Therefore, we had actually to recognize twice the
number of impairments in the second quarter from these big, big things in individual
stock prices.
But overall, our stock portfolio is in very good shape. And, actually, when I look at it today,
we are substantially above half-year level. And we decided at the end of the quarter not
to start now to sell some equities with positive development to make up for the
impairment losses because we felt selling was end of June a really bad timing as we felt
that the market would continue to recover more which seems to be, at least as of today,
the reasonable strategy.
So, with these points, I think we are coming to the end. Let me summarize the overall
results. Q2 hits by a lot of additional volatility and Korea one-oﬀ, in particular, still –
besides, if you want to say so, a lackluster second quarter, our half year is still resulting in
an annualized RoE of 12% which I think is still an outstanding number in the world of
ﬁnancial institutions.
For 2018, we feel also that our P&C combined ratio, still on track to achieve the 94%. Life
strategy making good progress. We believe we will move the segment to the 10% hurdle
to a very large extent. New business margin very well on track. Cost-income ratio for
PIMCO on track, and the other parameters will be updated over time, but none of the
parameters giving us at the moment any concerns that we will not – cannot shine with
them in 2018.
So, with this one, thank you very much, and I interested to learn about your questions.

Thank you. Our ﬁrst question comes from Peter Eliot of Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go
ahead.

FINAL

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thanks very much. I have three questions, please. The ﬁrst one was I was wondering if you
could give us a bit more color on the AGCS claims. I mean, there seems to be a bit of a
trend in weak results from Corporate solutions businesses across the industry, especially
from large losses. And I was just wondering if you could comment on – to the extent that
you think this is one-oﬀ or an ongoing trend?
Secondly, on targets, I mean, you mentioned how we can get to the 94% by cutting
expenses, turning around LatAm. I guess you're always probably going to have – by the
nature of it, is going to have some underperforming businesses, and you've got some
adverse trends which give you a little bit less wiggle room on the combined ratio. And
unlike one of your peers, I guess you've chosen to go through a point target on the sort of
the group EPS. You've got a bit more visibility now on how you might get that. I was just
wondering if you could comment on the sort of the conﬁdence on the EPS target as well.

Bloomberg Transcript

And then ﬁnally maybe a bit lighter oﬀ the results, I was very interested in your press
release in the 15th of June on the use of blockchain technology for cat swaps. I was
wondering if you could comment how quickly you anticipate that sort of technology being
ruled out, both from yourself and across the industry in general and the sort of relative
and absolute sponsorship (29:58) that might bring? Thank you.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Peter. So, AGCS, I don't think that we can recognize a claims
pattern. Let me take the example of the hailstorm in Texas. Wylie is a nice little town in
Texas which was hit in March 23 actually and April 11 again by a big hailstorm. It's actually,
I think, the April 11 event resulted in a €1.5 billion to $2 billion event for the whole
insurance industry, so quite substantial. And we have only very few customers there. But it
did cost us $80 million, the April event, and we had already in March something to book.
So for the half year, it was €100 million which we had to recognize for this event only. Then
there was the bushﬁre in Canada. There was some €20 million – the earthquake in Japan.
And then we had also a few large man-made losses here in Europe, but also Latin
America. I would not say that we can really say that is a claims trend which should worry
us.
And then the aviation losses, I think that is just – I would never (31:46) this quarter had
none, but actually the third quarter started already with a smaller aviation loss, but one
everybody could see in the news. So the 94% combined ratio, yes, there will be ups and
downs, but I think the overall portfolio management and we are in total not so far away
from the 94%. I think when you look at our numbers over the last years, we are below the
95% level. So the 94% is this last percentage point we have to move the average to. Quite
some levels, quite some diﬀerent events, and I think we are still believing we can move at
least there.

The EPS target, you can say a points target, sure. And I said when we introduced it, that is
about having in 2018 15% more than three years earlier, not that we go quarter-by-quarter
with a growth rate of 1.25%. Certainly, this year, we have, actually to bear some extras. But
even in the year 2016 where we bear some extras, I think we have still a good chance that
we ﬁnished the year with a higher EPS number than last year. And I think that is pretty
much intact. We are, at the moment, running at exactly 50% of last year's earnings per
share, if you want to say so. So there is – when you assume that we have a higher
operating proﬁt in the second half of the year and nothing special in plus and minus also
on the ﬁnancial market, then we are actually very much on track to end up also the year
here more in the plus category than in the minus category. So we are not giving forecast
on our net income, but when you add up all numbers, then the potential should be visible
to everybody.
The blockchain technology, that is our ART team which is using it. I think that is certainly a
very interesting test to implement it. Will it create huge volumes of new business, I think
that is a bit too early to say it. But I think it shows that we are in all categories clearly
running forefront technology and shows the positioning of our company. And I assume it
will add a nice additional proﬁt line. But cat bonds is not yet such a huge business that it
can – even with this technology to change our overall operating proﬁt.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you. And I just come back very, very quickly on the target and the sort of point
nature. I guess, I was referring also to the fact that it's not dependent on the sort of
economic environment which obviously in essence has deteriorated over the last year. I
mean, it sounds like that hasn't dented your conﬁdence too much. You may or may not
want to comment. Thank you.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Well, clearly is, and if this is your question, there is still the unused M&A budget which is
at the moment still piling up. And end of the year, we are sticking to our promise. If it has
not been used for M&A, we give it back to our investors. So that means either M&A
increases the earnings or we give it back and then the number of shares has been
reduced. So in both cases, clearly EPS enhancing, and that part is certainly part also of the
5% EPS logic. And in all discussions, over the last 12 months, 24 months, I think we have
never hidden that the EPS target is inﬂuenced by capital management as well as organic
earnings development.

Hi, James. Yeah.

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

I have three questions, please. First one, sorry to return to the combined ratio in the
second quarter. But I just wanted to understand the source of the underlying deterioration
in the quarter. You mentioned kind of if we adjust the large losses in prior year and all
sorts of things, then the 60 basis points of underlying deterioration in the quarter, the
commission ratio also got worse which presumably should be high commission to acquire
better proﬁtable business. So the net deterioration in the quarter is actually 1 point yearon-year, and on your current disclosure it's quite hard to see exactly which territories and
OEs that's coming from. So if you could just shed some light on the OEs that that
underlying deterioration is coming from, that would be helpful. Obviously LatAm actually
got a bit better in the period, so I don't see that as being a drag on the year-on-year
comparison.
Secondly, on the capital generation point. So I think previously you had indicated that
your net capital generation net of tax and after dividend accrual should be about 10
points on a normalized basis in a year. So if I kind of backsolve from what you were saying
previously where you take the average of the Q1 and the Q2, you end up kind of 24 points
pre-tax annualized. So net of tax, that's closer to 17 points. I may be nitpicking here, but I
just wanted to understand, are you – so obviously that's pretty dividend accrual, so the 17
points then goes minus 10 points to get you back 7 points. So are you actually kind of
saying that the capital generation is a bit less than when you had last indicated it? And
when I think about that capital generation, is there any reason why it should be growing
faster than earnings? Obviously, you've got the growth in there. In the new business it's
very strong and that should monetize. So how should I think about the growth trajectory
on that either 7 points or 10 points, whichever the number is that you're guiding to now?
And then, thirdly, I'm interested in your RoE target. So you increased the RoE target at the
Investor Day, at the same time as the EPS growth target. And if you just run through what
5% EPS growth gets you on the RoE based on your current payout ratio and allowing
perhaps for the deployment of the M&A budget, it still doesn't get you anywhere near
13% RoE in 2018. And the implication is you have to take – make quite a sizable move on
the equity base. So could you just tell me, is there anything I'm missing in that kind of
simplistic calculation? Are you planning on doing any debt reduction, or is it a simple case
of you're going to end up with more equities than you actually need, particularly given
you're currently very well capitalized on Solvency II basis? Thank you very much.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Okay. James, that is a lot of very technical question. But let me start with the combined
ratio that is more – the easier one. The commission ratio increase is quite often also for a
segment, the mix change and even currency rate change, the average commission ratio
and nothing has changed in the provisional business. So, therefore, it's always a bit of a
complicated story. But certainly, our expanding business, Allianz Worldwide Partners,
which is also over the last years one of our fastest growing business, in general, the
commission ratios in this business are substantially higher than what you have seen there,
Page 9 of 24

FINAL

so what we have seen. So therefore, a 10 basis points, 20 basis points movement is fairly
fast achieved, but we have also seen in markets like France or Germany a little bit increase
in average commission.
The markets which certainly and that was never hidden are facing, I think, soft markets, it
starts with Italy. So therefore when you see a decline in our Italian premium and you
compare that also with the announcement you have seen from the Italian market in recent
weeks, whether it was Victoria, whether it was Unipol or Generali, everybody reports in a
decline of motor premium of 6% to 7% which is also roughly our ﬁgure around 6%. Yes,
that is mainly a rates decline as it is – then the whole market is moving in this as the
number of cars has not changed in a material way. So that is an example, but also the
credit insurance and also our corporate business are writing more carefully because the
markets are softer. So as a correspondence, you see increases in the attritional ratio.
Overall, we see decreases in the attritional ratios in countries like Spain and the UK, in
Australia, in Turkey, in Argentina and I think that is overall, I think, going into the right
direction.

Bloomberg Transcript

So when we go to capital generation, I think we are still pretty close to the 10% number
because the number exactly, what is Life producing every quarter is a bit tricky to say. And
when I meant actually around 6%, that is actually – that is a pre-tax number. And that
means when you – I rounded it down. We actually had the ﬁrst half year, the 9% plus 4% is
13%. You subtract 30% taxes, you are at 9%, and either you multiply it now by 2% or you
save the other half as the dividend, so you get to roughly 9% in the half year. And I must
say, that is probably at precise as I can say it, and maybe it's rounded 10% or it's rounded
9% that I can really not tell you. And it will vary a little bit every quarter.
The RoE targets, well, with an unchanged equity, it would mean to move from 12% to 13%,
you need actually over the three years when my math is not wrong, a 6% net income
increase on an unchanged equity. Then you would achieve the 13%. So either you reduce
now the equity or you get to a combination of proﬁt increase and equity reduction. I think
there are plenty of combinations which would allow us to end with a 13% RoE. I think you
can also test it the other way when P&C makes the 94%, asset management stays stable
and we move our Life OEs as announced to the 10% minimum RoE, then also ending up
(45:15). So you can actually test it and verify it in various methodologies. I think the
chances are quite intact. And it was not an announcement about the result, that was just a
back-of-the-envelope test to make you, James, comfortable with the number.

capital generation plus the Korea and Taiwan beneﬁts, I'm getting to a ﬁgure of...

FINAL

Michael, I have not understood you. What -?

Q - Michael Igor Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Yeah. Sorry, sorry, I'll say it again. What's the pro forma Solvency, if I could, Korea, Taiwan
and your organic capital generation, so maybe at December 2016? I'm guessing with
somewhere around between 196% and 200%. And, also, can you give a ﬁgure for these
large claims? And just – it just would make my life a lot easier because then I could just pin
it down and move on.
And then, more conceptually, the €1 billion ﬁgure in Life which basically one-oﬀ, so maybe
dividend is a bit unusual over hedging beneﬁt. So maybe the run rate just closer to €900
million or €950 million. How would you explain – how does one explain that to a
generalist that even though interest rates have never been low in history, (47:06) earnings
continue going up. That would be – if I can do that, then I think the rest is actually not so
important. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Okay. On the Solvency II number, I'm not doing a pro forma forecast. You have to wait for
the announcement of the ﬁnal disposals of Taiwan and Korea as well as on the progress
on the operating or Solvency II earnings. I think we are – as I've said before, we are really
ﬁrm that we are managing our Solvency ratio in this range, 180% to 220%, and I think we
are also on good track that we can deliver also on all promises we made with our
dividend policy.
So what explains the good proﬁts in the Life segment? Well, I think the – yes, you can say
we still have a duration mismatch. So we are not fully hedged against the falling interest
rates. However, as we are hedged, for example, in Germany for the ﬁrst 30 years where
we have actually – we are not only cash ﬂow matched, we actually have more assets there
than liabilities in the cash ﬂow models. That means that also the relation between
guarantee and investment income we are making there is actually ﬁxed for this period. So
the interest rates in the market may swing, but our cash ﬂow matching for this year is not
changing. That means it's just one-oﬀ, and all this tail discussion and Solvency ratio goes
up and down, that is from an operating proﬁt point of view, we are talking here always of
the years 2045 and later.
And that, I think, is always forgotten in all this debate about mark-to-market. In times
where interest rates are zero or even negative, things which are 50 years away now are
being looked at a magnifying glass and actually become bigger in year ones than in year
50s. That is the eﬀect of negative rates, something we are absolutely not used to, whereas
accounting runs oﬀ year-by-year and we have to wait to the generation of, actually, CFOs
and accountants, actually, to show this operating proﬁt. Therefore, we are really mixing
the timeline up based on this complicated long-term models. And the new business

margin and the new business value we generate has actually only to replace the operating
proﬁt which is maturing. So if the policy – old policy is maturing, falling oﬀ the value
(50:30) operating proﬁt is gone, sure. And now the only question is it's maturing business
being replaced by the operating proﬁt coming out of the new business generated. And
with the new business margin of 2.5% and our current volumes of new business, the
answer is, yes. We calculate actually internally, that's even more precise, but I'm now not
making speciﬁc long-term forecasts for the Life segment. But you can hear that we – none
of us is in tears (51:09) here. We are actually quite conﬁdent.

Q - Michael Igor Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

A - Dieter Wemmer

losses, cat and other weather-related was in total close to €1.2 billion in absolute ﬁgures.
We discussed before the relative change to previous year, but the total number is €1.2
billion, is roughly the number.

Our next question comes from Thomas Seidl of Bernstein. Please go ahead.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you. Good afternoon. Three questions. First, on your 2018 targets, again, I
think last year November, you told us your assumption was ﬂat interest rate, not rising
interest rate. But since then the 20-year rates has fallen from 150% to 75% (52:45), and I
simply assume that like in the past your reinvestment yield is going to drop in line with
those swap rates. I mean, that has been the pattern for the last ﬁve, six years. So why
should it be diﬀerent now? So what are you doing in P&C and Life to still allow you to
achieve less EPS growth target? More important for me, the RoE target. So what
additional actions you are going to take to ﬁght this unexpected and as per last
November, unplanned dramatic drop in yield? So ﬁrst question.

FINAL

Second, I'd like to have a bit more clarity on M&A, please. In the past, and I think also
morning to journalists, you talked about the strategic ﬁt. So in P&C, would you include
greenﬁeld markets where the market is attractive, but you are not there yet in the strategic
ﬁt or must it be like I (53:39) in the past, a market where we're already operating and have
management capability on the ground?
And regarding Asset Management, I think Oliver Bäte said in March, he wants to bring
down the beta of the group. How does that ﬁt to doing potential M&A in the Asset
Management space? Is that basically increasing the beta of Allianz Group?
And third question, if I may, on PIMCO, just very brieﬂy. You're assuming now ﬂat assets
under management going forward. There was a one-oﬀ exit from one client in April as we
learned. How – and at the same time you're saying you're not planning further cost
cutting, so I don't square it, even if I assume rising second half performance fees, I don't
get to the 60% number. So what am I missing here?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Well, let me start with the PIMCO at the end. First of all, PIMCO has announced in June
actually quite some additional expense cutting which also aﬀects their HR base. So
therefore, that improvement is coming into the second half of the year. (54:55) the
question this morning was about additional announcement, and there I said I'm not
expecting for the time being additional announcements. And I think with the performance
fees should bring us actually already closer to the 60% level. And what I also said before
in my ﬁrst presentation that actually we still have 1 percentage point in the cost-income
ratio which is coming from the pension plan which is maturing and will be booked the last
time in Q1 2017.
So that means there is – and then I hope also – and not only hope, we are conﬁdent that
we also bring additional new developments also with the new leader for PIMCO. I think
that till 2018, we want to see also some positive development. PIMCO has already some
beta in its portfolio. I think when we would isolate the PIMCO's hedge fund business
which is already existing for quite some time, we would rank standalone amongst the top
10 hedge fund managers globally.
So, therefore, it is not that we are in everything a bit, we are actually doing already quite a
bit. So we would – it start ups, the right approach to acquire. I think we are looking also in
the Asset Management ﬁeld in many opportunities whether it's start-up or whether we
ﬁnd other things which could ﬁt the same as we are screening the insurance M&A market.
I think in insurance, the startups are probably, we are creating our own startups certainly
into digital space, but also in other spaces. But acquiring them would make in the digital
sector (57:23). Otherwise, our main M&A strategy has still to be creating scale in the P&C
markets where we have already a good starting point. That would be still my point.
And you have the question about, did assumptions have changed for our 2018 targets?
Yes, you are right. The investment income topic became much tougher. That is certainly, I
think, the Life topic we have discussed separately because the new business margin has
Page 13 of 24



Company Name: Allianz SE
Company Ticker: ALV GR Equity
Date: 2016-08-05

already been adjusted to the new input rate environment. So, in Life, we are already doing
the right things. Therefore, the open point is the falling investment income in P&C, how
can we compensate. And I believe that the expense topic is certainly topic number one to
look at.

FINAL

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Maybe one follow-up question on the M&A side. So you said when you have a starting
position, this means you must have an operation in such a country where you're looking
for accretive P&C acquisitions?

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

That would be the main point to look at because otherwise it doesn't move the needle
too much. Yes, we do also some right spot acquisition, most recent our acquisition into
Morocco. There was so far no question about it. We have so far 12 smaller countries in
Africa, actually all in the French-speaking part of Africa. Therefore, actually we will use
Morocco, then also as a center for driving our African developments. It's also from a
language point of view, a good combination. And then we will start more systematically to
build up our African businesses which are growing ﬁne. But they never make it even to
any disclosures in our reports because operating proﬁt numbers are still too small. So
therefore, Africa will not close the gap for the 2018 targets, but it is certainly a very good
basis and we want to be an early mover because for the next generation, it might be a
very important market.

The next question comes from Andrew Ritchie of Autonomous. Please go ahead.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Oh, hi there. Just one quick question. The reinvestment rate – ﬁrst question, the
reinvestment rate in P&C, the economic reinvestment rate actually went up 30 basis
points Q2 versus Q1 which is a bit surprising given what's happened to yields in the
market. I think in the footnote saying you may have changed the calculation basis, if you
could just clarify what's going on, that would be helpful.
Second question, Life RoE, that target still looks like the most challenging target for 2018,
especially in the current rate environment. If I look particularly at France. The French Life
ROE is very low. Is that a problem of R or a problem of E?
And ﬁnally, just on PIMCO, (01:01:11) whether your outlook is changed or not because
when I look at the transcripts in Q1, you were talking about small inﬂows that you're
expecting in the second half of this year. I think you're now saying breakeven, or maybe
you're saying breakeven for the period as a whole, but you still expect to get small inﬂows

Page 14 of 24

by the end of the year. Is there a change or not? And do you expect the new CEO to bring
a meaningful change of strategy at PIMCO, or is there sort of evolution? Thanks.

FINAL

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Okay, Andrew, I go also backwards. Let's start with PIMCO. No, I think that is just a nuance
in language, not a nuance in statement. It's between zero and small positive. I think that
we get to zero, small positive is probably the number I would expect. But I would – I think
I'm pretty unchanged in the statement not only compared to Q1, actually even to Q3 last
year.
The RoE is 10%, for everybody that is indeed a challenging target. But when we keep the
returns, that is an E question in France and we have a clear execution plan with our French
team. What are we changing? What are we doing? And we will be at a 10% level in 2018.

Bloomberg Transcript

So the reinvestment rates, there are two – well, it's actually quite a number of
explanations. First of all, the deﬁnition has not changed second quarter over ﬁrst quarter.
However, the cash-rich was reinvested had more emerging market share in Q2 than in Q1.
It was actually 16% versus 14% because we had more fresh cash in emerging markets but
it's also – I think Turkey and Argentina play a little role here. Further, we have increased
duration that you can also see when you look at our Q2 2016 duration number. We have
started to buy longer in the market and then also we are buying less covered bond and
grow more in the Corporate space. So I think the three things together adds to this little
increase.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

So is the emerging market just because the timing of reinvestment there or is that a
deliberate increase in exposure there?

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

No, no, that is in the local market. So it's not taking more work, let's say, in Germany by
buying Indonesian bond. It is really – we had – I think second quarter our premium income
in Argentina grew 56% and in Turkey motor we are also more than 50% growth in
premium income. And when you can invest in Turkey or Argentina, you get slightly
diﬀerent yield than investing in Frankfurt (01:04:32)

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

And then just the question on the new CEO at PIMCO, I think you're trying to suggest that
PIMCO does a lot of things already, for example, when you talked about hedge funds. I
mean – what's the color behind his appointment? Do you see it that there's going to be a
meaningful strategy updating change or is this more evolution?

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Well, I think evolution is the minimum. And when he has more ideas and brings more
interesting proposals, well, I think we should give him a chance to onboard. He is starting

Page 15 of 24

his job on November 1. So it's still some time from today. And then, I think that's probably
a good question to ask in a year from now, or maybe in Q1, but not earlier.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

All right. Thank you.

Next question comes from Paul De'Ath of RBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Paul De'Ath
Yeah. Hi. Just a couple of questions on the Life business M&A. And ﬁrstly, on the new
business side, obviously, you've been doing very, very well in capital-eﬃcient products,
particularly in Germany. And wonder if you could give any comment on sort of where the
competition is with that. Are you expecting others to copy your products and take some
of your very strong market share in that? And going forward, some guidance on that
would be good.

Bloomberg Transcript

And, secondly, just kind of to clarify really, on the investment margin, so I think you guide
to 19 basis points for the full year on the investment margin. Where does that go further
out than that? Should we be expecting a slight decline in that investment margin, or after
your comments on the sort of cash matching in Germany, is it going to be a lot more
stable than that? Thanks.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Well, actually, we are stable in the individual country numbers. We raised it to 90 basis
points compared to earlier years because the weight of the U.S. business and the overall
segment got bigger. And certainly Korea did also not help with investment margin. So,
therefore, I think the 90 basis points is intact guidance.
On the German competition and the German new business margin, it's actually a very
good question you are raising, Paul. We are at the moment still showing our German new
business margin in a very conservative manner. Due to the complex processes to apply
for our internal model, we could not adjust the German internal model to the new
products which we are selling so well and also some legal changes. We had actually to
deal with this, changes with add-on and on a bulk basis that we could really keep the
timeline for all this internal model approvals.
We are ﬁling this August an updated internal model for our German Life business, which
will then also be used for the oﬃcial Solvency II calculation beginning of 2017, assuming
that the regulator approve our changes. But what we will do is even without approval of
the regulator, we will use it for calculating the new business margin of our German Life
business from third quarter on because it measures that more precisely the capitaleﬃcient products we have missed there, actually, part of the new business margin and visà-vis calculation will lead to a nice uplift of the German new business margin, which is a
better reﬂection of what we are really doing.

FINAL

So does this mean that we need to be frightened of our competitors? Well, even if they
are now copying our products one-on-one, on average, the German competition has 100
basis points disadvantage on the expense ratio in Life. And the lower the yield
environment is, the more is the competitive disadvantage on the expenses piping.
Therefore, we are not concerned that the competition can really reach us in new business
volumes and what we are doing. And the more we sell, actually, that clearly helps our
expense positioning.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Sorry about that. Dieter, a few years ago, when the new dividend policy was introduced,
you had also mentioned the stock of capital and not just a slow. And I was just wondering
what your thoughts are on that? You have obviously this new target you have mentioned
time and again, does depend also on the (01:11:22) Even if you look at 186% now, there is
a couple of billion sitting there versus the 180%. So just wondering what your thoughts are
on that? That's the ﬁrst question.
Second question is, in the Life RoE discussion, the metric that you show on the slide which
shows the percentage of the business which is producing the 10%, this has fallen from 1Q
to 2Q. But, obviously, you need to get it to the 100% stage. And you mentioned France
where there seems to be the labor law problem related to some changes, which have
pressurized technical margin but also (01:12:07). And maybe could you just comment on
which are these markets which led to the compression in this metric that we see on the
slide?
And just very last, very quick one, (01:12:19). The frequency or large losses we've talked
about today, does it prompt you to change anything in the reinsurance or you think this
will be a one-oﬀ, no pattern kind of situation here? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Yeah. Okay. I think the large losses, we have not changed our reinsurance purchases. We
are constantly discussing with our in-house reinsurance as well as large OEs what is the
optimal retention you should take? Is there a possibility to take advantage of the soft
reinsurance market? What are still the trade-oﬀ? We have constantly this optimization
questions. But so far, we have only changed some small areas where we have bought a
little bit more of reinsurance, but nothing very material.
Actually, this calculation of the 10% RoE level, and I discussed actually with some of you
on the call this when we had here our little Capital Markets Day a few weeks ago, that you
are saying whether that's actually a very volatile calculation and there might be quarters
up and down. And I agreed that it is very much up and down. And at the moment, when I
look at the numbers, France, U.S. and Italy are really just short of the 10% a little bit. And
when I would show more an ample traﬃc who is below 5% – or traﬃc light logic, who is
below 5%, who is 8%, 9%, and who is at 10%, you would probably get a better feeling
where we are and we have, maybe to consider this.
It was very much also our internal communication. Either you are on the right side of the
table or you are on the wrong side, therefore we use this sharp 10% in-out calculation as a
benchmark setting. That gives – I think that is good for internal measurement. It might
give you not the right impression how close we are and how far away we are. And
certainly, when we do the Capital Market Day in November, we will give you there a much
deeper insight how we are standing and how diﬃcult the rest is.

On the dividend policy, I reconﬁrm that we certainly do what we said with the unused
M&A budget. Also, the 50% payout ratio absolutely unchanged. Other capital market
actions, well, we have still to see what M&A opportunities are coming up because the race
is not ending end of 2016. We will continue to look around. And I think we are, at some
point, the market will start also to move and there will be opportunities coming out of the
low yield environment. We have just to be patient. We just cannot push it through for this
year, then it might be next year or it might be in two years or it might be in three years. I
think the market will come sooner or later with good opportunities that we have not to
buy totally overpriced businesses that surprises are coming to a more rational level.

Hello. Thank you very much. Hi, Dieter.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Sorry, back on slide 9 and the operating Solvency II capital generation. I'm getting
confused over diﬀerent percentages that we're talking about. So can we just try and talk
about billions of euro instead? My back-of-envelope is if I strip out the variances of the
past couple of quarters and the Life business, the equivalent of the percentage points
you've been giving is about €2.8 billion per quarter of pre-tax capital generation. Can you
conﬁrm that's right?
And then following from that, what exactly are these variances that have bounced around
so much in the ﬁrst and second quarter? And how do we assume – are these going to
carry on bouncing in a big way, or has something funny been happening, and should they
net to zero or to something either side? You've been doing a lot of hedging. Does that
start to drag the capital generation at some point because there must be an opportunity
cost of managing your Solvency II ratio to be as stable as it has been.
And then ﬁnally on this point, how are you thinking about this capital generation ﬁgure
versus your distributable free cash ﬂow? Is it a temptation to say that this is free cash ﬂow
because it looks like regulatory earnings. But actually it's basically just an embedded
value proﬁt dressed up in another way. And, for sure, if you're doing €500 million a
quarter of new business value, for example, I can't believe that a regulator on the ground
would consider that distributable earnings on day one. (01:17:58) brief from that last point,
but just how you reconcile it with free cash ﬂow.

FINAL

And then to the extent that was about ﬁve questions in my ﬁrst. Very brieﬂy on the last
one. I thought your U.S. sales could've been weaker this past quarter because of the
impact of DOL on your ﬁxed index book. That clearly was completely wrong. You've had
another great quarter. But is the DOL change at some point likely to have a more visible
impact on your sales and why didn't it help the second quarter very much? Thank you.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

I think the DOL eﬀect, we will – probably will crystallize more in 2017, but we are still
optimistic that ﬁxed index annuity products are actually in the best interest of customers,
therefore, they will continue to play an important role. So I – that is, therefore, I go
backwards with your question.
So the other one is, I think we have disclosed 9% earnings generation in Q1. We have
disclosed the 4% here. So what is the driver of the ups and downs? It is not the new
business volume. It is really the total operating variance as you can also see it in our old
MCEV reports because it is essentially the same deﬁnition even when the calculations
under Solvency II are slightly adjusted, but not big diﬀerence. The logic is still the same.

Bloomberg Transcript

We had in Q1 a positive operating variance of €655 million and in 2Q a negative
operating variance of €826 million, to be very precise. And that is – I could now split down
into experience variance assumption changes and other operating variances. But by and
large, you can also look at our old MCEV reports that we are in total more on the
conservative side on this one than on the two optimistic side. So that means that the longterm average of this number should be more a small positive.
At the moment in the half year, we have actually a small negative out of the two numbers
which is very untypical for our long-term track record, but it was a speciﬁc update in
Germany which had to do with local step numbers and the way how we progress from
quarter-to-quarter. So, therefore, I still think that the average of the two quarters is a good
starting point and is not overoptimistic, it is a good starting point. Therefore, the 9% and
4% might be in total at lower long-term end, but it is a good starting point. Then you have
to take out the tax rates and all of this as we ran through it already with James when he
asked for it.
So how does it link to liquidity? Well, ﬁrst of all, I think we have done a lot of cash
upstreaming over the last years, has done it in a way and also we run the group at the
range 180% to 220%, but individual OEs, we run at a lower Solvency II target. That means
the diﬀerence between our average OE level and the average group level is the central
cash.
And at the center, there is no new business value we can hold as capital. At the center, it is
in the end very liquid surplus we have in our SE. Therefore, I would say the binding
constraint is more coming from our decision to run the group at the 180% to 220%
Solvency ratio and not from a lack of liquidity.
That might change in a number of years when the solvency generation and the new
business value are becoming more and more driving elements, but I think that will take
Page 20 of 24

ratio that I would have thought should have been very volatile. You're keeping it very
stable. There seems to be a lot of hedging that's going on. Isn't there an opportunity cost
that must be creeping out somewhere from that?

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

No, I don't think so. From my perspective, I think the hedging has still room for
improvement. And still when we – the ALM in the Life business also improved because old
(01:23:33) businesses are also maturing. When we keep the 30-plus year coverage,
actually, that will then also on all the business cover. The last years of this policy, actually I
would, from an ALM perspective, see that improving the hedging actually also reducing
our input rate sensitivity, which is one of our targets where we not move too much this
quarter, should actually still improve. And I still see in ALM hedging actually a reduction in
cost and not an increase in cost.

Right. Thank you.

So before we continue, Suzanne, we have a couple of minutes left, so we can take one
more question, please, if there's any.

Operator
Okay. The ﬁnal question comes from Nick Holmes of Société Generale. Please go ahead.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Hi there. Thank you very much. Just couple of very quick questions. First on U.S. Life.
Wonder if you could remind us of the hedging program on your ﬁxed annuity book and
your ﬁxed index annuity, that is. And I just wondered, Dieter, whether you could reassure
us on what protection you think there is if U.S. rates continue to fall?
And then the second is also looking at low interest rates this time in Germany. Just
wondered if you could update us on the size of the RSP? And if you could remind us of
how long you think it will take until the current low interest rate environment really eats
into the German (01:25:19) policies. Thank you.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Nick, hi. When you ask the question, I always know that I came to the end of my analyst
Q&A.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Yeah, yeah, same here, same here.

FINAL

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Yeah, yeah. As I said before, in Germany we are cash ﬂow matched for more than 30
years. The RSP actually in Q2 was up. So also, of course, that is only the quarterly
calculation in the (01:26:01) RSP calculation is only at yearend. But we are actually in the
numbers up. And therefore, I see it will take quite a number of years. And you probably
will not ask this question anymore when it has eaten into the system because it will still be
the case out.
Our ﬁxed index annuity business is 100% hedged. So, therefore, I'm not seeing your
question. Our VA business has interest rate sensitivity and actually our U.S. operating Life
proﬁt was lower than normal because we had a small loss of the old VA book that is the
VA book which was written quite a number of years ago. There we have some sensitivity.
And when you look at our new business mix in Q2, VA is making below 10% and 90%-plus
of the new business is ﬁxed index annuity. So our interest rate sensitivity is small and is
also not growing.

Bloomberg Transcript

And I think that diﬀerentiates us from other players in the market, who have a very
diﬀerent interest rate exposure. Certainly, what you have noticed is that the new business
margin in the U.S. is down because the new business margin is interest rate sensitive. And
we have a lower new business margin than we had in previous quarters. That is important
to see.
In the U.S., we are adjusting our new business assumption every two weeks. So, therefore,
we are not following there the general group rule that we use for new business margin at
the beginning of the quarter interest rates. In the U.S, we update this every two weeks
because ﬁxed index annuity business is sold in tranches and being repriced also every
two weeks. Therefore, we do it like this to be always up to market and not to run any
unreasonable interest rate risk in the sales process. So, therefore, the new business
margin in the U.S. reﬂects already quite a lot what has happened to the U.S. treasury rates
during the quarter. Did that answer all your questions?

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Well, yes, it does, certainly, most of them, Dieter. Thank you very much. There was just one
very quick follow-up, which is just to be completely clear on the ﬁxed index annuity, are
you saying that there is no rollover risk at all? There is no variable annuities, as you've
explained, have dynamic hedging and, therefore, some interest rate sensitivity. But is your
point that the ﬁxed index annuity has no rollover risk at all? You are completely hedged
against low interest rates.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

Well, what do you hedge in a ﬁxed index annuity? The interest rate is matched because
when you receive some money, you invest all the money you receive in corporate bonds,
which are duration matching. So, therefore, we do the repricing every two weeks. Let's

say, in the two weeks, we collect from our customers €250 million fresh money. The €250
million are speciﬁcally invested for the new money which came in. The dynamic hedging
is actually to the upside for the customers where we are investing because they are
participating in the upside of the stock market or whatever the underlying index is we
have sold to the speciﬁc customer. So it is – actually, everything else that you hedge then
the interest rate risk.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

But the ﬁxed index annuity product doesn't have a ﬁnite term, does it? Is it not -?

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

No, it's not a ﬁnite term. But it has an experience when customers are turning. It is also
used for their own pension beneﬁts. So therefore, we use an all-in duration assumption,
and so far I think we are doing very well with this duration assumption with the business.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

That's very clear. Thank you very much.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

And we have a lot of management levels. Actually we can, for the old blocks, always
increase expenses at some point. The product is also not so exciting anymore for the
customer if you want to say so.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

A - Dieter Wemmer

{BIO 4755450 <GO>}

So then I wish you all great summer. At the moment, it's very rainy in Munich. But for me, it
is also the last working day before my summer break, and hope to see you all somewhere
in the next months. And thank you for dialing in.

A - Oliver Schmidt

{BIO 2473131 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks, and good-bye from my side as well. Cheers.
