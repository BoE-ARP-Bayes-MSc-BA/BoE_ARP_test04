Operator
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Storebrand ASA Quarter 1
2015. My name is Anna. I will be your coordinator for today's conference. For the duration
of the call, you will be on listening only. However, at the end of the presentation, you will
have opportunity to ask questions.
I will now hand you over to Head of Investor Relations, Kjetil Ramberg Krøkje, to begin
today's conference. Thank you.

Kjetil Ramberg Krøkje
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Storebrand's ﬁrst quarter 2015
conference call. My name is Kjetil Ramberg Krøkje and I'm Head of Investor Relations at
Storebrand.
Together with me today, I have Group CEO, Odd Arild Grefstad; Group CFO, Lars
Løddesøl; and Head of Economic Capital Management, Trond Finn Eriksen. In the
presentation today, Odd Arild will give an overview of the development in Q1 and Lars
will give some more details on elements in the results and a brief presentation of the 2014
embedded value results.
The slides will be similar to the analysts' presentation released this morning and are
available on our webpage. After the presentation, the operator will open up for questions.

To be able to ask questions, you will need to dial into the conference call.
I will now leave the word to Storebrand's CEO, Odd Arild Grefstad, who will start the
presentation on slide three.

FINAL

Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Thank you, Kjetil. And start on slide three, Storebrand delivers a Group result of NOK450
million for the ﬁrst quarter of 2015, and a Group embedded value of NOK34.2 billion for
the full year of 2014.
The income grew signiﬁcantly, with 6.6%, adjusted for corporate banking and public
sector pension in run oﬀ. This is driven by strong sales and returns. Strong sales in unit
linked pension, and external customer inﬂows has, together with strong markets,
increased assets under management with 13% compared to last year and 4% in the
quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

We have experienced strong sales in insurance in the quarter with 7,000 new customers,
both from the agreement with Akademikerne and also from other customers. In total, a
13% growth in written premiums. We have succeeded in moving more than expected, to
pay the policies with investment choice, with NOK1.7 billion in the quarter. This aﬀects
results negatively by the building up for longevity reserves compared to last year. This is
due to higher conversions to non-guaranteed, paid-up policies, and the use of risk
reserves for reserve strengthening.
Let me also comment on a couple of things on the balance sheet. We have strengthened
longevity reserves with NOK1.2 billion in the quarter. We are now very comfortable with
the situation, as I said last quarter, and we prioritize measures that strengthen the balance
sheet over short-term results.
We report our Solvency I ratio 173% and an estimated Solvency II ratio of 152% in the
quarter. I will revert to these numbers in more detail in the presentation, and Lars will also,
through similarities and diﬀerences in economic capital and MCEV and Solvency II during
the presentation.
Let's then move to slide number four. Storebrand's business model is undergoing a
fundamental transformation. We have a dual strategy to manage the guaranteed balance
sheet and continue to grow in savings and insurance. We managed the guaranteed
balance sheet, now aiming for at least 130% solvency ratio. We will continue to grow in
savings and insurance by leverage our position in the individualized occupational pension
market.
Let me start with a brief update on the left side of the strategy implementation and then
we move to slide number ﬁve. We continued to transfer out guaranteed liabilities from the
balance sheet in the ﬁrst quarter. The transfer this quarter consists of NOK1.7 billion all
paid-up policies to paid-up policies with investment choice and a little more than NOK3

Page 2 of 17

billion in public sector transfers. We still expect to keep transferring NOK1 billion in paidup policies per quarter in 2015.

FINAL

Then, let's move to slide number six. Storebrand has reported estimated – estimates on
Life Group solvency for the last two quarters. The solvency ratio including transition rules
is strengthened with 4% points in the quarter to 152%.
All of the eﬀects come from the increase in transitional rules and is caused by lower
interest rates and increased equity stress. The solvency ratio without transition rules is
reduced from 101% to 98% and the reduction is caused by lower interest rates and an
increase equity stress from 42% to 47%. The result for the period and increased buﬀers
gives positive contribution.
And I'd like to add that with the increased interest rates we have seen now in the second
quarter. We are about 100% again. We are now in the ﬁrst quarter 2015 and the Solvency
II is implemented 1 of January, 2016. We have a clear objective to increase the underlying
solvency ratio by 10% points by year end.

Bloomberg Transcript

Then, let's move to slide number seven, longevity. We went into 2014 with a reserve
strengthening need of NOK12.4 billion. One year and one quarter later, we have ﬁlled
60% of the gap, equal to around NOK7.4 billion. This is a very clear example of us
prioritizing, strengthening of the balance sheet over short-term IFRS proﬁts.
As you can see on the right-hand side of the slide, we have a negative direct impact of
NOK154 million in the quarter and NOK121 million indirect negative result eﬀects from
foregone proﬁt sharing and risk results.
Let's move to slide number eight. Unit linked is still growing rapidly with 33% year-overyear and 10% from last quarter. This strong growth is driven by premiums growth by 17%
quarter-over-quarter, NOK1.7 billion on new paid-up policies with the investment choice
and, of course, strong markets.
The asset management continues to grow despite transfer out of guaranteed. Both
external public clients and assets from the Life Company is growing and the business area
works extremely well as the Group's asset gatherer.
The Bank has been relatively ﬂat in the quarter and it's fair to say that a lot of our sales
forces used eﬀort on paid-up policies and with the investment choice and on insurance in
this quarter.
And lastly, on insurance, the Akademikerne deal and sales to large corporates has really
accelerated growth in the quarter. As you can see on the slide, there is a 14% growth from
our written premium year-on-year, but more impressive, there is 10% growth since the
fourth quarter.

Then, I move to slide number nine, and I just wanted to end my part of this presentation
to show that the transformation is taking place in the business mix. Since last year, income
from savings has grown with 14%, and insurance premiums, which is not on this slide, has
grown by the same amount.

FINAL

At the same time, income from guaranteed pension has been reduced by 9%. This is
really our strategy coming through in the P&L.
And I will now leave the word to Group CFO, Lars Løddesøl, who will give some more
ﬂavor on the results and also take you into the 2014 embedded value calculations.

Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
Thank you, and good afternoon. On the ﬁgure 10, with the key ﬁgures, we show the
continued delivery of results before proﬁt sharing and loan losses above NOK0.5 billion
per quarter, even in a quarter where we see revenues from guaranteed business going
oﬀ, and also weak results from – risk results from the guaranteed pension business. We
also see the buﬀer building continues and earnings per share in the quarter was
NOK0.78.

Bloomberg Transcript

Over on page 11, I think Odd Arild has already mentioned many of the key points, and I
would like to comment brieﬂy on four areas where we see that the consensus estimates
were slightly higher than the numbers achieved in the quarter.
First, we see that the ﬁnancial result and proﬁt split from the Swedish business was weaker
than anticipated, and that you, as analysts, had reason to anticipate, based on the
sensitivities we give in the supplementary information.
The explanation for this is that certain contracts, when they are reserved in conditional
bonuses by 15%, any additional return does not go into the buﬀer, they go (10:26) into the
pension capital, i.e., it's a guaranteed contribution to the contract.
The new guaranteed contribution does not have a return requirement as such. It's only a
capital guarantee. But that means that NOK35 million this quarter has gone to increased
pension liabilities for guaranteed customers as a result of the falling interest rates and the
good returns in the quarter.
This is something that happens with eﬀect from the end of the year. So this is an estimate
in the ﬁrst quarter and it may be reversed if the returns does not continue to be as good
for the rest of the year. That accounts for a diﬀerence of NOK35 million on the net proﬁt
sharing and loan losses from the Swedish business.
The second area where we see a diﬀerence between the presented results and the
estimates is connected to the paid-up policies with investment choice where we have
converted NOK1.7 billion, as Odd Arild just mentioned, much higher than the NOK1 billion

FINAL

anticipated in the market. And as such, the reservation cost is about NOK35 million higher
than was anticipated by the consensus.
Thirdly, the risk result for risk result life and pensions is weaker than last year where we
had release of reserves in the ﬁrst quarter and weaker than people had anticipated,
amongst other things, because of the risk utilization fund, which we are not allowed to
take as a result component in a period where we are increasing reserves for longevity. So
this is a result component that will not – that has – will decrease during the period of
longevity reserve requirement, which Odd Arild also mentioned earlier.
And fourthly, the cost level is slightly higher than was anticipated. In the ﬁrst quarter last
year, we had some VAT returns and some bonus – some money that was set aside for
bonuses that wasn't used, which means that there were certain one-oﬀ elements that
brought the cost down somewhat in the ﬁrst quarter last year.
If we look at the underlying trend, the cost is up 2%. And that cost increase is connected
to our preparing to take onboard the Statoil contract and the Akademikerne contract, as
well as certain IT investments. We will continue to follow the cost level very thoroughly
and we will have continued tight cost control. And the cost income objective of 60% for
the year as a whole is something that we aim to deliver on by the end of the year.

Bloomberg Transcript

At this stage, cost income was 61% on a 12-month rolling basis and we'll revert with that on
a quarterly basis with the exact ﬁgure so that you can see the development yourself. That
concludes what I want to say about the results. And for the sake of time, we will move over
to the embedded value numbers, which are shown from page 21 onwards.
Storebrand Group MCEV, or embedded value, was NOK34.2 billion at the end of 2014.
For the Life Group, the embedded value was up from NOK27.7 billion to NOK30.3 billion
before closing adjustments, which gives 9.5% return on the opening balance.
By adding on to that the closing adjustments and the IFRS value of other subsidiaries, we
get the embedded value for the Group at NOK34.2 billion or NOK76.6 per share. This is
an improvement of NOK3.3 billion, of which NOK2.3 billion is an increase of the capital,
while the value of in-force is up NOK1 billion.
The numbers are impacted negatively by the interest rate fall and positively by buﬀer
building and by changes in the investment strategy and the risk management. There is a
signiﬁcant gap between the embedded value of NOK34 billion, the book value of NOK25
billion and the value on the stock exchange of NOK13 billion.
This can be partly explained by the fact that embedded value measures the value of
future business, and the discount factor today is very low, which means that the value of
future proﬁts is a high value.
Furthermore, we see that the return on embedded value, or on the value of in-force, is low
compared to some European peers. And this is probably related to the way we measure
Page 5 of 17

FINAL

new sales when new people that work in a corporation are replaced or when one person
leaves a corporation with a pension plan in Storebrand is replaced by a new person, that's
replacement sales and not new sales.
The value of new sales is down in 2014, partly because of margin pressure, and mainly
because of a change in the cost allocation model, where we more granularly allocate
costs to operations or new sales. And that has negatively impacted the value of new
business.
While this picture shows the correct technical way to present embedded value and the
movement, I will like to lead your attention to the following page, page 22, to go through
the movement in a slightly more simplistic way.
The interest rate fall in 2014 decreases embedded value by NOK4.3 billion. In addition,
we have harmonized the embedded value model with the Solvency II assumptions and
changed the discount factor to the same as Solvency II. This reduces the values by an
additional NOK2.9 billion, altogether NOK7.2 billion.

Bloomberg Transcript

Previously, in our embedded value calculations, we showed this as a sensitivity with the
Smith-Wilson curve. Now, we have certainty around the Solvency II curve and we use this
curve also for embedded value.
The strong returns and results during 2014 increases values by NOK2 billion; ﬁrst and
foremost, as a result of higher assets under management in the unit linked business,
which creates future proﬁts. Then, we add on to that the value of new business, and the
fact that we have got a lot of new unit linked customers in Norway, as they are converting
out of deﬁned beneﬁts schemes moving into deﬁned contribution schemes, and that
increases the future value. The total value of this is NOK3.2 billion. Reduced costs and the
cost allocation model that I mentioned a moment earlier increases the value by an
additional NOK1.8 billion.
The next step is building our hold to maturity bonds. Risk management between diﬀerent
paid-up policy portfolios, and modeling that is more granular in terms of expected new
paid-up policies with respect to the interest rate guarantee and the buﬀers on those
policies, improves the numbers.
On the contrary, we have put in an expectation that, in the future, there will be further
margin pressure on unit linked contracts in Norway, both in terms of the deﬁned
contribution contracts as well as the pension certiﬁcates coming out of those contracts in
due course. This, in itself, reduces the value, but the totality is an improvement of NOK2.5
billion.
And lastly, there are some currency changes and other elements that increases capital by
an additional NOK1.3 billion for a total of NOK31.4 billion for the Life Group.

FINAL

On page 23, we have put together embedded value and Solvency II in the same picture.
And as I've mentioned, we now use the same interest rate curve to deduct in both
models. Both Solvency II and embedded value starts with shareholder surplus or equity,
and the two numbers are very similar, approximately NOK15 billion.
In embedded value, we add on to that the look-through value, which is the net present
value of the margin that the Life business leaves in Storebrand asset management. This is
not calculated as part of Solvency II.
Furthermore, we add on to that the value of the in-force, which is the Solvency II name or
the reconciliation reserve, which is the embedded value name. Here, there are large
diﬀerences in the methodology.
In Solvency II, you start with today's business without future proﬁts, i.e., short contract
boundaries. In embedded value, we take on the new premiums in existing contracts,
which gives more income into the future, i.e. long contract boundaries.

Bloomberg Transcript

This is a realistic assumption in a company that is not in run-oﬀ. The diﬀerence is about
NOK4 billion in value. Furthermore, there is a big diﬀerence in the way you calculate
CNHR in embedded value and risk margin in Solvency II.
In simple terms, Solvency II has more and higher stresses, especially for lapse risk,
something that is corrected out in embedded value. And last, we see that embedded
value does not account for subordinated loans, which is tried to mark here with a red
square in the picture.
Moving over to the following page 24, we put the values of transitional rules in Solvency II
and we see that this accidentally gives a similar value for total economic capital as
embedded value.
So, I guess, we can say that the Solvency II number is the correct regulatory capital with
standard model, while embedded value is a similar now with the same assumptions,
similar model, however, with more realistic assumptions in terms of on the stress and on
the contract boundaries, which means to some extent that it is an approximation to
Solvency II with internal model. We use both in the way we manage the business and
manage the risk in the business.
And with that, I give the word back to Odd Arild to sum up our presentation.

Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Well, thank you, Lars. I just want to add on that there is strong growth in the strategic right
areas this quarter that fuels the shift in the business mix. We show that we prioritize buﬀer
building and strengthening of the balance sheet. Most obvious evidence is that we have
increased the longevity buﬀers by NOK1.2 billion and that we transfer paid-up policies of
NOK1.7 billion into investment choice.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. The ﬁrst question comes from Peter Eliot, Berenberg. Please go ahead, your
line is now open.
And I'm so sorry for that, there is technical issue, I will open right line open, I'm so sorry.
Peter your line is now open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thanks very much. I have two question areas, please. The ﬁrst one comes under capital
part, so I apologize but looking at the 6.4 billion that you transferred from fee-based to
paid-up in the quarter, would you be able to say how much of that was from your own
scheme closing and how the remainder compares to a run rate you might expect, going
forward? I appreciate there's some seasonality in there, but just perhaps you could sort of
tie that into the forecasts that you've made before for the progression of paid-up policies.
And am I right in thinking that, if we hadn't had that, then the solvency ratio would have
been about 5 percentage points higher, probably?
The second thing I wanted to ask on was, it's early in the year to talk about dividends, but
just because you mentioned the 130% and, clearly, you're at 152% at the moment that
would point to very positive. But clearly, the market is probably more focused on the 98%
as the relevant number. I'm wondering if you could just remind us what bearing you
consider the without transition rule number has on your, and perhaps the regulator's,
impact on that decision eventually. Thank you.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
Peter, if I answer the ﬁrst one. The transfer out of deﬁned beneﬁt plans is as expected, and
we have made a projection in our Solvency II calculations, as well as our embedded value
calculations, in terms of expectations as to what happens this year.
Storebrand is part of that expectation, and the run rate, if you take the Storebrand
contract out, is approximately as expected. And there is also seasonality, as you say. We
expect more to take place at yearend, i.e., with an eﬀect in the ﬁrst quarter than during
the rest of the year.
I'm not sure whether we've published the size of the Storebrand's plan, but it's about 2.5
billion. So that's almost half of the number that took place in the ﬁrst quarter. Then, in

Page 8 of 17



Company Name: Storebrand ASA
Company Ticker: STB NO Equity
Date: 2015-04-29

terms – so, your expectation about 5 billion more capital, as this is according to plan and
according to expectations, this is not a change in the capital as such.

FINAL

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

If I should comment on dividend, I would say that we are very satisﬁed with the
development in the balance sheet in this quarter. Also, of course, satisﬁed with the
numbers on Solvency II with the transitional rules, then there is no new message around
the dividend this quarter. It's the same as we did on our Capital Markets Day. And, of
course, the Board will make up their mind at the end of the year.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Operator
The next question is coming from Matti Ahokas, Danske Bank. Please go ahead. Your line
is now open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. It's Matti Ahokas from Danske. Two questions, please. Firstly on
capital, as you say, you've been increasing capital at the expense of short-term proﬁt. But
like Peter pointed out also in the previous question, actually, as you say, that even on full
Solvency II, you're above 100% on the transition rules, you're clearly above the target. So
is this really necessary or was this more of a function of the signiﬁcant fall in the interest
rates in the ﬁrst quarter, and how should we look at things, going forward?
Also on the same note that, if you look at your subordinated capital or subordinated loans
are around NOK7.5 billion. Wouldn't a good way to increase the solvency also to potential
increase that level, especially when interest rates are this low?
The second question is regarding the guaranteed pension business. And you point out in
the presentation that you say that lower results are the new normal, but should we take
the NOK81 million that we're seeing this quarter is the new normal run rate for the
business, or is it something else? Thanks.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

If I start on the paid-up policies and the conversion, if that is necessary, if I understand
your question right, I would say that it makes perfect sense, both from a customer
perspective to make this possible for our customers to move from paid-up policy into
investment choice.
Then, it's also make perfect sense economically, when you look at it. We free capital by
moving from capital heavy paid-up policies into paid-up policies with investment choice.
We also fuel our growth in the savings area. And, of course, it will give us also good
results in the years to come. So this is a win-win situation, as I view it. And I'm very happy
Page 9 of 17



Company Name: Storebrand ASA
Company Ticker: STB NO Equity
Date: 2015-04-29

to see an increased charge in the quarter for this extra conversion from paid-up policies
into investment choice.

FINAL

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
Your second question on subordinated loans, I guess you could say that we have a
toolbox of available things to strengthen the solvency position, increased subordinated
loans is in that toolbox and we will evaluate using some additional subordinated loans in
the second half of the year. We're not likely to do anything before the summer.

A - Kjetil Ramberg Krøkje
Yeah. And looking at the guaranteed segment, just looking at the three main products, I
think on deﬁned beneﬁt you see that we hold the same top line margin, but the top line
will go down in accordance with the sanctions you use for the reserves. Paid-up policies
will also develop according to assumptions and the modern studies there.

Bloomberg Transcript

And then you have the charge for longevity, which is NOK90 million a quarter, which is
communicated. And we have said that we will do NOK1 billion a quarter this year in paidup policies with investment choice. And that will also give a charge of roughly NOK30
million to NOK40 million a quarter. Of course, if we do more or less, that will aﬀect that
charge.
And then when it comes to the Swedish line, you know that there is volatility in that result
line. And of course, we need to follow the sensitivities, and also your own models, to look
on that results for proﬁt sharing. So when that's said, I think that, yes, low results are the
new normal, but there are also some more volatile elements in this segment that you
need to look on a quarterly basis.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

So NOK81 million is not the new normal?

A - Kjetil Ramberg Krøkje
Sorry, well, it's a lower result is the new normal, but just given the volatility in the
guaranteed segment, we to say that it's exactly NOK81 million, that will be a very precise
estimate for something that isn't so precise.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Great. And if I can have another follow-up one on the capital? We talk about 10
percentage point increase in the solvency margin. Is that meaning that it would be from
150 percentage points to 10 percentage points, or is that the full Solvency II, or which one
are we talking about here?

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
We are talking about the one without transition rules.

The next question comes from Ashik Musaddi from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line
is now open.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. So I would like three questions. First of all, can
you just update us whether your Solvency II number that you reported on slide number
22, I guess – slide number 23, sorry – yeah, includes the NOK5 billion you still need to add
on longevity reserving, so is that adjusted in that? That would be great if you can give
some color.
Secondly is, can you give us some more color on what is really this NOK11.5 billion
transition rules? So what are the sort of transition rules are you using at the moment, to
get some sense? And thirdly is, are you using ultimate forward rate as well? And, if yes,
what is the beneﬁt of that under both the Solvency II numbers that you have ﬂagged?
Thank you.

A - Kjetil Ramberg Krøkje
If I may start? The Solvency II number published on slide number 22 includes that there is
a longevity charge that needs to be met over the coming years. The second question on
transition rules, we are taking usual two diﬀerent transitional rules. So, the ﬁrst one is that
we are applying a 22% stress to the equity, instead of 47%. That's included in those
NOK11.5 billion that you see.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Kjetil Ramberg Krøkje
It also include the diﬀerence of the value of the best estimate liabilities under Solvency II
and under Solvency I.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Okay. So the best estimate liability on Solvency I is used under Solvency II?
Page 11 of 17



Company Name: Storebrand ASA
Company Ticker: STB NO Equity
Date: 2015-04-29

A - Kjetil Ramberg Krøkje
Yeah, so you take the diﬀerence between the Solvency I liabilities and the Solvency II
liabilities and you add that.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay, yeah. Thank you.

A - Kjetil Ramberg Krøkje
And your last question was on the ultimate forward rate?

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Kjetil Ramberg Krøkje
And yes, we are using the ultimate forward rate in the calculations. Of course, the reason
why we use the ultimate forward rate is because there is no available long dated bonds in
the market. So it's kind of diﬃcult to say what the ﬁgure would be without using the
ultimate forward rate, because there is really no market rate to use.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

So, even if you use a euro SOC curve (34:36) that is still not any idea about what should
be the beneﬁt, or is it really diﬃcult to judge because we don't have a Norwegian risk free
rate for that?

A - Kjetil Ramberg Krøkje
Yeah. It's at least be a very (34:49) to use the long-term euro market, since Norwegian
interest rates tends to be quite much higher.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

And you're using this for both the Solvency II numbers, both standard and the transition
rules one?

A - Kjetil Ramberg Krøkje
Yeah, we are using it for the standard model on the transitional rules. It's implemented
with, of course, the diﬀerence between the Solvency I ﬁgure, which is based on today's
Solvency I calculations in Norway, and the Solvency II calculation as shown without the
transitional rules.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Okay. That's very clear. Thank you.

The next question comes from Blair Stewart from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line
is now open.

FINAL

Q - Blair T. Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thank you and good afternoon. I've got a couple of small questions just to pick up on.
Firstly, on the 10 point underlying improvement that you're expecting in economic capital,
could you perhaps outline what those actions are? Are they standard operational aspects
that we're seeing at the moment in the numbers, or are there exceptional management
actions still to come through?
Secondly, you talked – I think you said that you still expect to be transferring on average
NOK1 billion of reserves into the new paid-up with investment choice for the year. I just
wonder is that the NOK1.7 billion we've had in Q1 plus NOK1 billion targeted for each of
Q2, Q3 and Q4, or are you still sticking to the NOK4 billion for the year, even though
you've had a strong Q1?
And just ﬁnally, on the impact of the higher than expected longevity provisioning that
you've done. You're clearly ahead of plan. What is the impact of that in the ﬁrst quarter on
the economic capital position? Because obviously, you're further ahead in your reserving
plans than you would have expected at the end of the year. Thank you.

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

If I start with the conversion of paid-up policies. I would say that we're very pleased to see
the NOK1.7 billion in the ﬁrst quarter. When I just went in for this conference call, I also
saw that we have now crossed the line for NOK3 billion so far. We started October 15 and
the progress has been very good.
Our oﬃcial number is below NOK5 billion for the full year-end of 2015. But, of course, we
are very pleased to see that we have started very well oﬀ and the expectation is more on
the positive side, or on the negative side, when it comes to that guiding.

Q - Blair T. Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

So NOK5 billion for 2015?

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

That is our oﬃcial numbers. We haven't reverted those, but, of course, we have now a run
rate that is still above NOK1 billion a quarter, so – and we are doing all our eﬀorts to beat
that. I will expect to see, more or less, NOK1 billion a quarter, going forward.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
And just a quick comment. The NOK5 billion was including the NOK1 billion we did in 4Q
last year. So, NOK4 billion for 2015.

Yes. That is our optional numbers. Yeah.

FINAL

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
When it comes to the impact of other longevity reserve strengthening on economic
capital position, it's somewhat diﬃcult to isolate the diﬀerent eﬀects, but it would be
approximately three percentage points from reserving NOK1.2 billion. It should also be
noted that, in our projections, we are going – we leave the answer there, I think,
approximately three percentage points.

Q - Blair T. Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Is the three points, is that the full NOK1.2 billion or is that the additional amount? I guess,
you would expect to reserve something like NOK800 million rather than NOK1.2 billion. Is
it the additional – Is it the incremental amount or is it the full NOK1.2 billion that's a three
point eﬀect?

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

That's the full NOK1.2 billion that gives the 3% eﬀect. And that shows, actually, that in our
Solvency II model, we're discounting with low interest rates, a large part of the remaining
NOK5 billion in the calculation is expected to be covered by shareholders' equity.
But, of course, in the real world, when we are going forward with this high level of buﬀers
and also with already 60% covered, we expect to be much closer to a 20%. That is the
rule of use of equity compared to the number that comes out of the calculation. So that is
a part of the growth of the solvency number underlying that we expect, going forward.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
So, back to your ﬁrst question on the 10 percentage points improvement plan, that
includes what Matti asked about, in terms of subordinated loan that's available in there.
You have the reserve generation, you have the reserve building, and you have a further
reﬁnement of models that we are working on where we see that we are able to improve
the quality of the modeling.
So there are a number of – and some of the improvements in modeling, I should say, goes
both ways, not only improvements, there are also things that go the other way. But on
balance, we expect that these things will go in the right direction, and the toolbox has a
number of tools in it, which we can use more of or less of depending on interest rate
movements and successful implementation of diﬀerent tools.

Q - Blair T. Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay. But you have – just to be clear, you have included the expectation of additional
debt raise (41:25) in that 10 point target?

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl

I would say that that is a tool in the toolbox available for us to use, if other tools do not
give the expected eﬀect.

Q - Blair T. Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. So if needed?

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
Yeah, if needed (41:43).

We do have another question from David Andrich from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Your line is now open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - David T. Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. Just one question on my side. I
was just wondering, you're sitting with the transition rules under Solvency II about 152%
and you state that your target's to be above 130%. And I guess I was wondering, I know in
a question regards to the dividend earlier, you said obviously it's up to the board. But I
guess I was wondering, in terms of if you were to fast forward to the end of the year and
be sitting in this position, would you feel then comfortable recommending a dividend?

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

I feel very comfortable about the situation and the way our buﬀers are developing. And of
course, it's a clear aim for us to come back as soon as possible with a dividend, and I will
have a clear view on that with my board at the year end.

Q - David T. Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

All right. Thank you very much.

We do have another question from Gianandrea Roberti from Carnegie. Please go ahead.
Your line is now open.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Yes. Hi. That was Gianandrea Roberti from Carnegie. Just a couple of questions from my
part as well. On the dividend, do you know, or do you feel like, the fact that although
you've done quite a bit of longevity strengthening, there is quite a bit to go? Do you feel

FINAL

that there's an impediment, from a regulatory point of view, for you to paying a dividend,
or do you get any signal on that, or you just don't know? That's the ﬁrst question.
And then if I go back to the earnings power, I understand everything that you've been
saying and trying to explain, I basically have a strong feeling that in the current situation,
you basically have around NOK450 million, NOK500 million per quarter of Group results.
So that's what we should be looking at. Is this something that you can conﬁrm or how do
you feel about that? Thank you.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

I'll start with the ﬁrst question. And I think it's fair to say that the regulator, of course, had
the opportunities to have guidance on dividend in Storebrand. But – and it's also fair to
say that the life insurance company's dividend capacity (44:41) is not the only dividend
capacity (44:44) in the Group. I think last year, we had NOK700 million from asset
management, from banking activities, from insurance activities. So there is also upstreaming opportunities beside the life insurance company that can be utilized for
dividend payments.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
And, Gianandrea, we are not giving earnings guidance, as you know. But instead of giving
you a number, we could reason around the numbers that we gave now and the volatility in
those numbers, if you want to. And if you look at page 10 in the presentation, graphically,
we show that result before proﬁt sharing and loan losses has been in the order of
NOK600 million to NOK550 million in the last several quarters. And the composition of
that is fee and administration income, where we show that we have an increase, although
we are losing business from corporate banking and municipality business.
I said the risk result to life and pension is somewhat weaker than we expect, going
forward. We see a strong growth in insurance premiums with the contract that we have
with Akademikerne. And we know that the second and third quarter tend to have fewer
claims than the ﬁrst quarter and the fourth quarter due to the weather seasons in Norway.
On operational costs, I've said that we should be able to control that throughout the year.
And in terms of the ﬁnancial result, I said that the ﬁnancial results were good due to good
ﬁnancial markets in the ﬁrst quarter. So at least that gives you guidance on some of the
components coming into result before proﬁt sharing and loan losses.
Then below the line, net proﬁt sharing and loan losses is really dependent on the proﬁt
split in Sweden. And that, again, is dependent on interest rates and interest rate
movements, and your guess is as good as mine, or yours probably is better because
you're an analyst, and provisions for longevity, and we talked about that during this call.
And then maybe I should add that in the fourth quarter, we tend to take into net proﬁt
sharing and loan losses also – positive surplus return – yeah, performance fees in the asset
management business. So there's usually a pickup in that in the fourth quarter. So that, at
least, is some comments around the diﬀerent elements in the results.

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Yeah, and based on that, of course, we had a very strong development moving paid-up
policies into investment choice, NOK1.7 billion. That is somewhat higher than you should
expect on a quarterly basis, going forward.
