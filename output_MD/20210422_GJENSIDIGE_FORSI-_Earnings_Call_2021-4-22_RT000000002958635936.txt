Presentation
Operator
Good day, and welcome to the Gjensidige Q1 2021 Results Presentation. Today's conference is
being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms.Mitra Hagen Negard,
Head of IR. Please go ahead.

Mitra Hagen Negard

{BIO 3974076 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to this first quarter presentation of Gjensidige.
My name is Mitra Negard, and I'm Head of Investor Relations. As always, we will start with our CEO,
Helge Leiro Baastad, who will give you the highlights of the quarter; before our CFO, Jostein
Amdal, will go through the numbers in further details. And we will have plenty of time for Q&A at
the end. Helge, please.

Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Thank you, Mitra. Good morning, and welcome, everyone. I hope you are healthy and well. We
have started 2021 on the strong foot continuing the good momentum from last year. The
pandemic is still in progress and many countries including the ones where we operate have been
hit by multiple infection waves, followed by a tough restrictions.
However, thanks to tremendous efforts to rollout vaccination programs. It seems like we are
bending the curve in many geographies. And although, it is too early to see the end of the
pandemic, it is encouraging to hear plans for gradual reopening of some societies.
We are very pleased to see that despite the challenges and economic hardship, general insurance
continues to be highly valued by our customers. And thanks to our strong product offering and
dedicated employees, we have managed to generate good results.



FINAL

Let's turn to Page 2 for some comments on our strong first quarter results. We've generated a
solid profit before tax of NOK1.597 billion of which NOK1.040 billion in underwriting results. Earned
premiums rose by 6.1%, reflecting solid renewals and effective and differentiated pricing measures.
Our combined ratio was 85.1% significantly impacted by the unfavorable weather conditions during
the quarter. The pandemic had a positive impact on our results this quarter, too, primarily related
to travel and motor insurance. Large losses were slightly lower than expected, while run-off gains
were somewhat higher than the planned releases.
Our loss ratio adjusted for the unfavorable weather conditions and COVID impacts improved
compared with the first quarter last year. Our cost discipline remains strong as you can see from
the ratio of 14.5% for the quarter. And it generated a financial result of NOK556 million. Jostein will
afterward rework with more detailed comments on the results for the quarter.

Then turning to Page 3, a few words on our operations. Let me start with Norway. Operations are
running very well, despite the strict pandemic restrictions and remote working for almost all
Gjensidige employees. I am very pleased that we have managed to continue putting through
necessary price increases in both Private and Commercial and at the same time increased volumes
and maintained our high customer retention. Being able to do this in this tough competitive
environment is the strong proof of our solid value proposition to customers. We see the need for
further price increases in Norway to reflect claims inflation. The challenging weather conditions this
quarter are a strong reminder of the volatility we must be prepared for with implications for claims
inflation. We have been raising prices for private property insurance in Norway well above index
during the past couple of years, and we still have pockets in this portfolio, which need to be
addressed before we reach a satisfactory probability. We also plan to continue with significant
price increases for certain pockets in the large corporate portfolio in the Commercial segment.
With no signs of market contractions so far, and a continued hard market, we expect premiums in
Norway to continue this strong development. We have had good progress in our Danish
operations. Our efforts to consolidate and strengthen the Gjensidige brand have proven effective,
with the record score for brand awareness among prospective customers this quarter. We see
further upside to operational efficiency, and to that end our cooperation with Tata Consultancy
Services is progressing well, leads prospects for promising results within claims handling. The new
core IT system in Denmark is currently in the last stage of testing before opening up for the first
private products. We have spent some more time than initially planned on this stage to ensure a
successful and smooth launch later this year.
In Sweden, we are fully focused on transforming our business to become a more digital insurance
provider. Our ambition is to deliver excellent customer experiences through digital services and a
high degree of automated internal processes. We are in the process of identifying and
implementing a number of new measures and we look forward to speaking more about this later
this year.
We see the need to grow in the Swedish market. To that end we have recently acquired a wellestablished insurance agent Nordeuropa, which will strengthen our position in the commercial
market. And this standing market trends and customer needs is vital to succeed in establishing a
strong position for Gjensidige in Sweden. We have recently invested in Schysst, a platform
providing a flexible subscription solution for using and owning car. The offering includes a variety of
services such as insurance provided by Gjensidige, road assistance, car service and the second
holiday car. We expect Schysst to provide us with key learnings on mobility ecosystems and car
ownership trends. Challenging market dynamics continue to put pressure on our profitability in the
Baltics. We have a clear ambition to increase the results through improving our distribution, pricing
and claims handling processes.
Then over to Page 4, and a few comments on our latest initiatives and research to support our
sustainability goals. We strongly believe in encouraging our customers to make sustainable choices.
Earlier this month, we entered into an agreement with the official Nordic ecolabel, The Swan, in



FINAL

Norway. We are the first insurance company in the Nordics to provide ecolabling of private house
reconstruction in connection with claims settlements, with focus on low carbon footprint and a
good indoor environment. We ranked number two in the insurance and pension category in
Norway in the Sustainable Brand Index ranking for 2021. Competition is tough and we have no less
ambition than to get back to the top ranking.
Earlier this quarter, we launched a new coverage for our health insurance in Norwegian commercial
market in collaboration with our partner Braive. The extension includes access to an online mental
treatment program led by a psychologist. Many companies have increased focus on mental health
among employees with an aim to reduce pressure from stress and depressing following the
conditions during the pandemic. Gjensidige has recently renewed the sponsor agreement with the
Norwegian Athletics Association, which through a number of projects will continue to target
physical and mental health. We had a strong focus on our employees, who have shown high
resilience and made tremendous efforts to maintain our strong operations through this pandemic.
We are very pleased to see that engagement scores have remained on a high level so far. We pay
high attention to their well-being and monitor the situation closely. We have introduced a number
of initiatives to mitigate potential negative effects in terms of physical and mental health
conditions.

As you know, the EU taxonomy reporting will come into force from January 2022. We will report on
sustainability metrics across three dimensions, operations, customer base, and products and
services. Our focus is currently on transforming product design, tariffs and damage prevention
initiatives to meet the criteria. The transformation will be carried out in a customer-oriented
manner, and in close collaboration with academic partners.
And with that, I will leave the word to Jostein to present the first quarter results in more detail.

Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Thank you, Helge, and good morning, everybody. I will start on Page 6. We delivered a profit
before tax of NOK1.597 billion in the first quarter, compared with the loss of almost NOK500
million in the same quarter last year. The significant improvement was driven by our financial
results, which were hit hard by the financial turmoil last year. Our pension business also recorded
higher results than the first quarter of last year. Despite strong growth in premiums, our
underwriting result was slightly down year-on-year, reflecting unfavorable weather conditions in
Norway compared with the same period last year.
The winter in Norway this year has been extraordinary cold, with long periods of low temperatures
in many regions. This resulted in significantly higher freeze and fire claims for property insurance in
the first quarter, compared with the first quarter of last year, when weather conditions were
favorable.
We saw some positive claims effects from the COVID-19 situation for all segments this quarter,
too. Adjusted for both the weather and COVID-19 claims effects, the underwriting result was up
compared with the first quarter of last year, driven by Private, Commercial and Denmark. Sweden
and the Baltics reported lower results.
Turning to Page 7. Earned premiums were up 6.1% or 6.4%, adjusted for currency effects. All
segments except the Baltics recorded higher premiums. In the Private segment, the increase was
driven by price increases motor, property and accident and health insurance. We also increased the
number of customers. I'm very pleased with us demonstrating such strong competitiveness and
maintaining our solid position in Norway. Lower demand for travel insurance due to the pandemic,
resulted in slightly lower earned premiums for this product lines.



FINAL

The rise in premiums in the Commercial segment was the result of effective pricing measures,
solid renewals and portfolio growth, including one new large contract. All the main product lines in
this segment recorded higher premiums. Price increases and volume growth in the Commercial
segment drove the premium growth in Denmark. Premiums rose from most the insurance products
in the Commercial segment. Price increases for workers compensation have been substantial
going into 2021 in response to index increases. Premiums in the Private segment were somewhat
down. We continue to see lower demand for travel insurance and motor insurance; it was
negatively impacted by depressed auto sales.
Earned premiums for our Swedish operation were mainly driven by volume growth in the
commercial portfolio. This was slightly offset by a volume decrease in the private portfolio.
Premiums in the Baltics were down year-on-year. There has been lower demand for travel
insurance over the past quarters as a consequence of the pandemic. And we've had significant
price pressure in motor insurance on the back of fierce competition.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning over to Page 12. The loss ratio for the first quarter was up 1.7 percentage points to 70.6%.
Large losses were up the year-on-year, although the normal level was somewhat lower than
expectations for our quarterly average. And run-off gains were somewhat higher than our planned
release. We have estimated increase in weather-related claims in Norway to approximately
NOK360 million or 4.5 percentage points on the loss ratio.
The low temperatures cause problems not only for pipes but also vehicles. However, motor claims
were not materially above the first quarter last year as motor SKUs are less costly than many of the
types of motor claims. We saw less travel activity and driving during the first quarter as a result of
the pandemic. We estimate the positive impact on claims to approximately NOK130 million,
corresponding to 1.9 percentage points on the loss ratio of this quarter. This is 2 percentage points
higher than the same quarter last year. Then we have the negative pandemic impact of 0.1
percentage point.
Adjusted for both these weather and COVID-19 claims effects, the loss ratio improved by 0.8
percentage points, and the underlying frequency loss ratio improved by 0.7 percentage points
compared with the first quarter of last year. In terms of segments, I'm particularly pleased with the
development in Private, Commercial and Denmark, all starting further improvement in profitability.
We see a clear upside potential for the results in Sweden and the Baltics. As Helge mentioned, we
are on the path to transform our Swedish business into becoming a more digital and highly
efficient insurance provider. We're implementing fundamental changes laying the ground for
becoming a strong niche player in the attractive Swedish market. Also in the Baltics, we have a
clear priority of returning to a more profitable level, with the particular focus on improving cost
efficiency. We have already seen results of some efforts in the cost ratio, however there is much
more to be done.
So talking about costs. Let's turn to the next page. We recorded NOK1.011 billion in operating
expenses in the quarter, corresponding to our cost ratio of 14.5% and 13.9%, excluding the Baltics.
We have steadily brought down the cost ratio over time. Thanks to our combination of growth in
premiums, cost efficiency measures and strong cost discipline across the group.
We are pleased with the decline of our cost ratio in Norway to 11.5%. Denmark recorded the stable
cost ratio of 14.6%. As Helge mentioned, we are in the process of preparing for the launch of the
new core IT system. The system will allow more flexibility, increase our ability and enable further
simplification of processes. We expect this to make a significant contribution to our cost efficiency
in Denmark.
Our Swedish business had a cost ratio of 18.4%. As mentioned, we are in the process of making
significant changes to operations and we expect to see further cost efficiency when the changes



FINAL

are implemented. The cost ratio in the Baltics came down 0.7 percentage points. Nominal costs
were also down, thanks to cost saving initiatives. We'll continue to put new measures to enhance
cost effectiveness in the Baltics.
A few comments on our pension operation. The pre-tax profit came to NOK45 million, up year-onyear, reflecting growth in the business and good returns from the financial investment, but also the
financial turmoil of Q1 last year. Assets under management continue to grow reaching NOK44
billion in the first quarter. Annualized return on equity was 13%. The solvency margin at the end of
the year was 150.5%. So far the introduction of individual pension accounts has not led to any
significant change in market dynamics. However, it is prudent to expect some pressure on
profitability in the short to medium term. We and the other players in Norway are in the process of
preparing for the transfer of policies, which will start in May. This is expected to make -- take most
of the year.
The pension business is an important complement to our general insurance business in Norway,
particularly within the SME part of our operation and generates cross-selling opportunities. 67% of
the customers in our pension business were general insurance customers as well in the first
quarter.

Moving on to the investment portfolio. Tremendous fiscal stimulus packages and accelerated
vaccine rollout in many countries have fueled optimism about the global economic rebound. Equity
markets perform strongly this quarter with a sharp boost and appetite for cyclical shares. And
credit spreads continue to contract.
On the flip side, the flare of inflation and rising interest rates put pressure on bonds. Our
investment portfolio generated a return of 0.9% in the first quarter with the (inaudible) portfolios
returning 0.6% and 1.3%, respectively. We have a solid fixed income portfolio with the large
majority having an investment grade rating. The rise in interest rates had a negative impact on our
fixed income investments with long duration, while the improved the outlook for economic
recovery, supported returns on our fixed income investments with credit exposure.
Our equity investments and commodities generated good returns reflecting the strong market
development. Our private equity holdings had particularly strong returns this quarter. This was a
result of both higher market valuations and successful transactions in some of the underlying PE
funds. We have a good share of property investments, mainly in offices in the central business
district of Oslo and with very low vacancies in the portfolio. We however, pleased with the return
on our property investments reflecting the strong commercial real estate market in Norway.
Over the Page 12, a few words about the successful issuance of two subordinated loans back in
March. We wish to utilize the attractive market opportunities and our loan capacity to ensure a
more optimal capital structure. We issued one-tier one bond and one subordinated Tier-2 bond
both in amount of NOK1.2 billion. The Tier 1 bond has a perpetual tenor, with floating rate coupon
of three-month NIBOR plus 225 basis points and the Tier 2 bond has a 30-year tenor, with the
floating rate coupon of three-month NIBOR plus 110 basis points. Both bonds were settled on the
7th of April. As announced earlier, we will redeem the subordinated to Tier 2 loan of NOK300
million (inaudible) Forsikring in June. And we also have the intention to call the (inaudible) Forsikring
Tier 1 loan of NOK1 billion, issued in 2016, later this year.
Looking out for capital position on next page. Our capital position is very strong with the solvency
ratio of 215% at the end of the quarter, including both the subordinated loans, which were settled
on the 7th of April. The solvency ratio is up 16 percentage points from the end of Q4, mainly driven
by the issuance of the loans, I just mentioned.
Operating earnings, our returns on the free portfolio also contributed to the increased eligible own
funds. And as usual, we have led [ph] dividend of 80% of the result. The capital requirement is up



FINAL

due to rising market risk reflecting higher exposure to equities both for non-life insurance business
and in the unique link portfolio in our pension business. The proceeds from the new subordinated
loans also led to an increase in market risk. Our own partial internal model gave a solvency margin
of 263% at the end of the first quarter.
Finally, a few words on the latest development of our operational targets on Slide 14. I'm very
pleased with the progress on the majority of our operational targets this quarter. By delivering on
these operational targets, we continue to improve our competitive position and lay the ground for
future profitability. Both customer satisfaction and retention in Norway remain very high. The latter
reflects the strong renewal for both Private and Commercial. The retention level outside Norway is
slightly down for all three segments this quarter, primarily driven by temporary market contraction
due to the pandemic.
We have exceeded our target on sales effectiveness based on running 12 months at 17%
compared to the baseline year 2016 -- '17, mainly driven by higher sales in Norway. There will still be
some volatility in these figures going forward. The share of automated tariffs is somewhat up
compared to the level last quarter. And we currently stand at around 53%. Progress is good and
will continue to include more products going forward. In addition to further refining tariffs already
included.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the claims handling side, digital claims reporting has gone slightly down this quarter, whereas
the share of claims handled fully automatically have been stable. We'll continue to develop these
digital services further through 2021 and onwards. We have reduced claims costs further and
exceeded our target this quarter. Procurement and process optimization making the largest
contributions to the increase.
I'll then hand the word back to Helge for some concluding remarks.

Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Thank you, Jostein. To sum up on Page 15, we are very pleased with the strong underlying results
we have delivered in this winter quarter. This is to a large degree result of a solid brand, efficient
operations, and dedicated employees, who put strong efforts in serving our customers every day.
Structural growth is still on our agenda. Our solvency position is very robust. We are committed to
having a strong capital discipline. Together with the encouraging results outlook this provides us
with a solid base to deliver a continued, steady and nice regular dividend curve also beyond 2022,
when the planned run-off gains will come down. Special dividends have been and will still be
utilized from time to time to ensure an efficient capital structure.
Our outlook is promising. Our Nordic markets have shown strong resilience, and the pricing
environments particularly in Norway and Denmark are very good. This together with our strong
product offering and efficient operations lay the ground for continued strong resurge, going
forward.
And with that we will open for Q&A session. Thank you.

Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We'll now take our first question. Caller, your line is open.



Q - Hakon Astrup

{BIO 18861149 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. This is Hakon from DNB Markets. So two questions for me. The first one is on
the run-off side. Can you just explain particularly why the run-off is a bit higher than the (inaudible)
quarter? And --

FINAL

A - Mitra Hagen Negard

{BIO 3974076 <GO>}

Sorry, Hakon, your line is blurred. Hakon, your line is blurred. Could you speak directly into the
microphone?

Q - Hakon Astrup

{BIO 18861149 <GO>}

Is it better?

A - Mitra Hagen Negard

{BIO 3974076 <GO>}

Not really. Let's give it a new try.

Q - Hakon Astrup

{BIO 18861149 <GO>}

Hello. Is this better now?

A - Mitra Hagen Negard

{BIO 3974076 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes.

Q - Hakon Astrup

{BIO 18861149 <GO>}

Yes. Okay. Sorry for that. Two questions for me. The first question on the run-offs. Is there any
particular reason why run-off was higher this quarter than usual? And the second question on
solvency. You have reduced solvency position at the moment, 215%. So if we assume that you're
going to call bonds later this year. So what would you do with the excess capital?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Thank you, again, Hakon. On the first one, we continue with the plan of run-off somewhere around
NOK250 million per quarter and then each and every quarter there will be volatility around those
NOK250 million and that could go both ways. And that's based on the just an ordinary process of
setting reserves. Remember that we are talking to book around NOK30 billion technical reserve
side and climate[ph] changes in the credit models may introduce small changes there. And there
has been some positive run-offs this year, but there's nothing particular about the run-offs this
quarter.

Q - Hakon Astrup

{BIO 18861149 <GO>}

Yes. So the message was the run-offs is coming down after 2022 still stands?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

I think the message is still the same that we have the planned run-off gains of approximately NOK1
billion per year throughout 2022 and that we continue to reserve according to best estimate.
On the solvency question, as you correctly pointed out, if you follow up on our intention to redeem
the Tier 1 issue of 2016, that takes out around NOK1 billion or approximately 10 percentage points
on the solvency ratio. I'd like to stress that what we did now was to utilize what we saw as to get
market opportunity to issue new loans. And I think if you look at the spreads that we achieved
here, that seems to be at the very competitive level compared to what others have done recently
and what we also done ourselves earlier. And that has been the intention all the way to utilize good



market opportunities to increase the utilization of the available capacity for subordinated loans and
then how to spend or use that capital is a matter that will be resolved over time.

Q - Hakon Astrup

{BIO 18861149 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

We will now move to our next question. Caller, your line is open. Caller, please make sure you're
not on mute.

Q - Christoffer Adams

{BIO 15217428 <GO>}

Yes. Hi. This is Christoffer Adams from Kepler Cheuvreux. Helge, you said that there's a need for
further price increases in Norway. How large do you expect these price increases to be and what
you expect from claims inflation? Thank you.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Thank you, Adams. First and foremost, we are really satisfied with the momentum in our
Norwegian business. And we have increased competitiveness and strong growth. As I said, we still
see some room for further price increases above claims inflation which is -- on property which is
around 4%. We think that claims inflation for motor insurance will be in the span of 3% to 5% and
we will also price above that, but when it comes to motor insurance, if you look at our earned
premiums, we have a very balanced mix now between price and volume effects. It's 50/50. So we
have a very strong and good compositional volume and price effects.
So I guess going forward, we will be just above claims inflation for motor; for private property, we
will be more than above still and we still see some pockets also in the commercial book for price
increases above claims inflation. But we are in a much better competitive position now as
compared to one year ago with more balance between volume and price effects.

Q - Christoffer Adams

{BIO 15217428 <GO>}

Thank you. Can you be a bit more specific on the commercial side in terms of the price increases?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

That is some pockets both for SME and large corporates. So -- but as you also have seen from the
report, we have strong momentum in our commercial business. It's a hard market. We gain new
customers. The retention levels is high, 91%, 92% but it has been a long period behind us with soft
markets. So still it's pockets where we have to increase price increases more than claims inflation
and we managed to do that without losing customer. So, so far this is very -- is a very good
position also for the commercial business.

Q - Christoffer Adams

{BIO 15217428 <GO>}

All right. Thank you.

Operator
We'll now move to our next question. Caller, your line is open.

Q - Analyst
Good morning. Thanks very much for taking my questions. Especially, how large was your
acquisition in Sweden? What's the expected ROE? And what's your latest hurdle rate for maybe
larger M&A more broadly?



FINAL

And secondly, it sounds like your year-over-year price increases, based on your comments about
now requiring price increases above claims inflation in certain pockets and certain books, do you
think that the 0.8 percentage point year-on-year underlying frequency loss ratio in group, I mean
you're flagging this quarter, is a reasonable run rate for the short term based on your current
actions and what's still to (inaudible)? Thank you.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

I'll then start with the first one and I might need to ask you repeat it also, but I'll start on the -- you
asked about the Gjensidige's asset and acquisition in Sweden of Nordeuropa, which is a general
managing agent. So it's not an insurance company, it's a managing agent. And we have not
disclosed neither acquisition price nor any ROE. There is no reserves or portfolio as such following
this, this is not an insurance company, but they have a very competent and good staff with a good
standing in the Swedish market, especially towards brokers, and their loyal customer base. But it's
not a general insurance company. So we will take into these customers, if you will, as new.
So sorry about not being precise about the hurdle rate. Our general hurdle rate, as we said is 6%
after tax, is our cost of equity, that's what you're asking. And of course, when we look at
acquisitions, we will see how much value can we drive above that hurdle rate at that cost of equity.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

On the second question, I could maybe start and give you some more visibility regarding the
underlying change in frequency loss ratio and you mentioned 0.8%. As you have seen, it's still
positive COVID effects in first quarter of 2021, at the same level as we had in fourth quarter, 1.9%.
And you have also seen from the report that it has been really cold winter in Norway and
significantly higher freeze and fire claims for property. And you have to go back to the year we
listed the company to find a similar year 2010. We have estimated this to NOK360 million, 4.5
percent points on the loss ratio.
The impact on the underlying frequency loss ratio was 3.1%. And so we also have large losses into
this picture. So -- and we are very pleased with the positive change in frequency loss ratio adjusted
in Norway and Denmark. So if you look at the private segment, we have a positive change -- 1.9%
positive change in underlying frequency loss ratio adjusted and for the commercial segment 1%
and in Denmark 0.7%. And talking about the future and it's hard for us. We have commented that
we have strong competitiveness, strong momentum, hard market in commercial market in Norway.
And if you adjust for the freeze and the COVID, we have improvement underlying frequency loss
ratio. So that's a good starting point for the next quarters.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Yes. And if I may add also, you remember that when things go -- start to go a bit sour insurance, it
takes time to turn it around. The good thing about that is when things -- when we are in a good
momentum like we are at the moment it also lasts for some time. And as Helge mentioned, if you
take away one-offs we are or -- and the COVID isn't a one-off effects, it is in the fifth quarter or
whatever it is now. But there is a good momentum in our profitability underlying taking away these
kind of disturbing elements like weather and the COVID.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

And that combination with growth, so it's a good situation.

A - Jostein Amdal
Yes.

Q - Analyst

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}



Thank you. And is it fair to say that your price increases have peaked year-on-year or is it I guess,
you're saying with your more corporate business that you're not now SME in some pockets of large
corporate that needs rate increases or because it's a hard market that you're going to try and put
through the rate increases even if you don't necessarily need them?

FINAL

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

I think what we're going to do is just put through the prices increases where in some pockets we
do and don't think the profitability meets our targets, which is just ambitious targets. But in general,
we take out the price increases that we deem also possible. So it's a combination. And it's still a
fairly -- in the commercial segment we're talking about, it's still a fairly hard market I would say, also
driven a bit by a much harder reinsurance market, which probably mostly effects the top end of the
commercial segment, but still trickles down some of the remaining market.

Thank you.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Good morning. It's Jan Erik from ABG. Jostein, just to be clear on your weather versus large
losses. Did I understand it correct that you have 3.1 percentage points underlying over the losses
and 1.4 of those are sort of taking into the large level? If you can clarify that?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

It' not 1.4 of those, it's 1.4 on top of the 3.1. So 4.5 percentage points altogether.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Yes. So there is 4.5 in total, 3.1 as a reminder and 1.4 as large losses out of 4.5?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. And then is there any news on the run-off gains beyond 2022, which you can
shed light into as to further we should expect zero from that level or is this something we should
take a half level or what should we think about that? If you could shed some light on in terms of
details.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Jan Erik, I think the communication is just as it was last quarter. The planned releases ends at in '22,
and from '22 onwards it's best estimate. And we have also said that we think we will live with
positive gains instead of negative gains also after '22, but we haven't given any guidance on that.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay. Finally then on the weather side, the 4.5 percentage points. Is all of that into housing or a
(inaudible) offering to cards, it's sounded like on your card for motor insurance side was more
flatfish level versus end of the year, if you think about driving versus the weather claims this time
around or the colder weather. Is there -- could you just shed some more light into the second half
how the split into housing and motor, please?



A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

This is only related to property. Only property.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay. Perfect. Finally then on the structural side here. I expect structural growth to happen, how
should you do that?

A - Jostein Amdal

Yes. The communication is unchanged also there, it's on our agenda. We want to increase our -strengthen our position in Nordic general insurance and we are prepared to look into any M&A
opportunities that arise and you know our hurdle rates, et cetera, et cetera. And we have a very
strong financial position. So it's quite unchanged also on that side, Jan Erik.

We will now move to our next question. Caller, your line is open.

Q - Vegard Toverud

{BIO 17129809 <GO>}

Good morning. This is Vegard from Pareto. I was first wondering on the run-off gains in the quarter.
Could you say something about which products these are related to? And how we should think
about the run rate and the yearly communications, the high run rate -- high run-off gains in Q1? So
that reduce the expectation for the remainder of the year or is this with the no impact going
forward?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

The run-off gains above the NOK250 million that was planned is spread around different lines of
business. It's nothing particular about these run-off gains. What we've done now outside the
NOK250 million does not have an impact on the planned reserve releases for the remaining part
of the year.

Q - Vegard Toverud

{BIO 17129809 <GO>}

Okay, thank you. And then on couple of foreign operations there. Customer retention seems to be
falling in the March. Are you losing market share there and how should we think about the growth
outlook in local FX?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

I think the target remains the same of this 85 outside of Norway, but the COVID situation and
effects through travel insurance has an effect on the retention rate as well, because these are also



FINAL

policies that are not renewed. So it has a negative effect on retention. I think this is the main single
reason. Now, as we talked about in the Baltics, we have the tough competitive situation on the
especially the obligatory motor product and motor TPL insurance, which also weighs negatively on
our retention numbers. This we are kind of trying to keep up profitability there and down there we
lose some customers.

Q - Vegard Toverud

{BIO 17129809 <GO>}

But in Denmark, is your understanding that you are maintaining your market share?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Market share numbers in Denmark are extremely lagging. So it's -- but I think we have the
impression that we are more or less in line with market development overall. But these numbers
are I think more than a year lagging.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

One year lagging, I think, Vegard. The situation now in first quarter is actually very strong sales and
strong momentum in Denmark also, but the latest market shares, do you have.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. The latest market share, but I think development is so old (inaudible) there's old. So it doesn't
really -- our retention numbers are fresh.

Q - Vegard Toverud

{BIO 17129809 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Yes. I think you'll need to look at when other companies report.

Q - Vegard Toverud

{BIO 17129809 <GO>}

Picking up on your comment there on the Baltics and also your previous reminder that it takes a
long time to turnaround the profitability. The pressure you see on multi-product there, how long do
you expect it to you to turn that around?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

I mean, the two problems on top line of Baltics is COVID, which is based heavily on the travel
insurance and then the competition on the motor side. I think these (inaudible) kind of main two
headlines there. And COVID, your guess is as good as mine. On the multi, I think we are seeing
positive signs underlying which means that we should be able to come back to with positive results
over coming quarters. But let's wait and see, giving any short-term guidance here, but we're still
fairly confident that Baltics will contribute positively to the NOK750 million outside of Norway and it
should promise for the next year.

Q - Vegard Toverud

{BIO 17129809 <GO>}

Okay. And then finally moving on to Sweden. You were referring to the loyal customers of
Nordeuropa. Could you tell us roughly how much premiums these loyal customers currently have?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

I don't think we have this real stuff, Vegard. So it's -- yes, I'm sorry. I can't -- of course we have
them, but we haven't disclosed those premium figures. It's something large --



Q - Vegard Toverud

{BIO 17129809 <GO>}

Okay. Hope we will find out over the next two years.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes, let's say next 12 months really when we -- when the renewal -- these are annual policies, so.

Q - Vegard Toverud

{BIO 17129809 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

Operator
We will now move to our next question. Caller, your line is open.

Q - Alexander Evans

{BIO 19956412 <GO>}

Hi, everyone. Alex Evans here from Credit Suisse. I just wanted to follow up on something you said,
Helge. You said 3% to 5% claims inflation in motor. I seem to remember you previous saying 3% to
4%. So is that a rise in claims inflation you've seen there?

Bloomberg Transcript

And then maybe just secondly on private property in Norway. Maybe if you could just give bit of an
overview of what you've seen competitors doing in there? Do you think you have been a little bit
of hedged and now competitors are maybe catching up, so there's potential for some volume
growth there?
And then just finally on commercial, obviously very strong growth. It looks like commercial, accident
and health has been a big driver there. Could you just give some details on what's driving that?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Yes. On the claims inflation first, I think we have earlier quarter commented 4% to 5%, and now we
have it's down to 3% to 5%. I think the main figure from Norway is actually 4% claims inflation.
That's maybe the estimate for -- that's the estimate for property, and I guess that's a good
estimate also for motor insurance. But it's a more -- it's more, I would say uncertainty to motor
insurance going forward. It's new cars, as you know. And so therefore, I commented 3% to 5%. But
I think 4% is a good estimate. And 4% is a good estimate for property and personal lines is more G
Regulation and wage increase regulation.
This is higher claims inflation, when you compare to Denmark. So in Norway, we still have to
increase prices above these levels to maintain the profitability level. And as I said, we have to
increase prices in some areas more to strengthen the profitability. So if anything from last quarter
to this quarter, it is maybe slightly reduced around 4% is a good estimate, talking about motor
insurance claims inflation.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

In terms following up on the property side. It's -- I mean, we have fairly flat development in terms
of number of houses that we're insuring, but fairly high price increases, which drives, of course, for
a good premium growth there. Given that we put through price increases significantly above the
expected claims inflation, it should mean that -- and without losing customers, it should mean that
competitors probably are doing something of a similar. But this is hard to kind of discount because
this is -- most companies like us, they use fairly differentiated tariffs. So it's not one market price
for health insurance as it's for travel. But judging from our price increases and the market tractions,
I think probably competitors are doing something similar.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}



And for motor insurance, you asked if you are ahead or not versus our competitors. As I
commented, the premium growth for motor insurance, it's absolutely balanced, 50/50 between
price effects and volume effects. That means I think that we maybe are ahead of some of the
competition when it comes to price increases from motor insurance.

FINAL

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

And your final question was about the volume growth within the commercial sector. I think
Gjensidige have a very good starting point there, because we have significantly higher profitability
in that segment than a couple of our main competitors here and our market share is higher within
commercial than in private. We have an extremely loyal customer base and we have very satisfied
customers. So it's -- I think the potential here for driving through price increases on average still
above expected claims inflation is absolutely in place.
And here we have also, as we've already commented, this is the total premium growth within
commercial, it's a combination of volume and price although prices probably a bit more than 50%,
but still it's a combination.

Q - Alexander Evans

{BIO 19956412 <GO>}

Thanks. Can I just follow up on the commercial, accident and health? Is there anything in particular
going in that line or is it just (inaudible)?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

That is mainly volume growth.

Q - Alexander Evans

{BIO 19956412 <GO>}

Thank you.

Operator
We will now move to our next question. Caller, your line is open.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning, everyone. It's Blair Stewart from Bank of America. I've got a couple of
questions left. Firstly, you mentioned, Jostein, about pressure -- sorry, pressure in the pensions
market. Could you maybe just quantify that? I know it's a small segment for you, but are you able
to quantify what margin pressure you would expect as the individual pension account rolls through?
And I wonder, if you could comment just generally on the M&A environment in the Nordic region? Is
there anything going on that you can talk about? Thank you.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

I'll give you a flavor of the movements in the pension business rather than quantifying it. It is I think
new way from what's been the main source of income pension capital certificates and over to this
new and old pension account. We expect and there to be a margin pressure, but also the volume
is over time growing here. So I think longer term this could still be positive for the -- our profits
within that business given that we maintain or at least maintain our market share. So that is margin
negative, but profitability as such will grow in line with increases in assets under management still.
M&A environment, Helge?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}



Yes. Blair, as you know, the list has become shorter, but there are still further consolidation
opportunities in our markets and I guess it's always something going on. It's not always it ends with
M&A transactions, but we see still opportunities and we are actively seeking opportunities and we
are well prepared for small opportunities and bigger opportunities. That's I think the signal from us.

FINAL

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Yes. Thanks, Helge. Can I just ask one thing that's been troubling me on M&A? You've got a very
good business that generates attractive returns on equity. I think your target return on equity is
20% or 16% excluding reserve releases. Yet, when you talk about acquisitions, you talk about
hurdle rate of only 6%. Just wonder, how did you square those two things. Should we just expect
the M&A would be dilutive to your ROE targets or would M&A with businesses that you buy be
expected to move up to the 16% to 20% ROE over time? Thanks.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

I think the two numbers are slightly different; 6% is the cost of equity, the kind of the cost of new
money put into our business, whereas the book return on equity is 20% after tax that you are
referring to. And if you take a look at, for instance, the one really large acquisition that has taken
place in the Nordic market over the last 12 months, which is the acquisition of Tryg by -- of RSA by
Tryg, for its Scandinavian part, here it, of course, has a huge effect on ROE as a booked ROE. But
when we've done our 17 whatever it is portfolio transactions and small transactions over the last
year, that is contained within the book ROE target. So it all depends. That's the easy answer.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So I'm assuming by that your group ROE target will change?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

It's unchanged.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

It is unchanged, but --

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Yes. But if you were to do a sizable acquisition, let's say by historical standards, is that -- does that
present a risk to your ROE target?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

I think I will comment on that when we get there, if we get there.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

We'll now move to our next question. Caller, your line is open.

Q - Analyst
Hi, there. It's Will (inaudible) from UBS. Just a couple of quick questions left. Just as you know, new
way home, I'm just trying to understand what must be the underlying concern on this line, this
demanding prices is above claims inflation. I think we are assuming (inaudible) losses as largely just
one-off. Is there any adverse claims trends, for example, I may not have captured or is it just a
pricing issue over a month of same period?



And secondly, just thinking, if I look at market by the U.K., there's pricing pressure coming through,
for example, because of COVID frequency being passed to the consumer. Is there any debate in
the mortgage market? Is there any challenge on pricing that we have as a result? Thanks.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

FINAL

The last question is it's easy to answer. It's no discussion and no pressure so far.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

First one, your line was slightly bad, but I think you asked about private property or housing, was
that correct?

Q - Analyst
Yes. That's right. Just trying to understand the exact drivers of what's causing prices to be
expected to be above claims inflation. Is there an adverse claims trend on the roll?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

I think we've commented on this since around 2019 that there is -- that we haven't pricing -- been
satisfied with the profitability in that line of business. When we kind of turned the corner on private
cars, we kind of moved on to private housing as there is a need there to increase prices more than
claims inflation to get those rates down. And also longer term, we do expect what we call climate
effects or at least increased volatility in weather to have the unaffectedly need to price in on
average. And then from each and every quarter, there will be growth in both directions, but on
average we do expect higher claims for private housing due to weather or climate. And this is also
part of our kind of strategic agenda to try to mitigate those claims effects to claims prevention and
preventive measures. But in the short term, we need to price this up to meet the price increases.

Q - Analyst
Okay. Thanks.

Operator
We will now take our next question. Caller, your line is open.

Q - Johan Strom

{BIO 17541253 <GO>}

Thank you. Johan Strom, Carnegie. First on the weather effects. I'm not sure, if I missed that in
previous comments there, but can you break that down into different segments? And then
secondly, you obviously have very impressive cost efficiency with 13.9% cost ratio, excluding the
Baltics. But I'm just still a bit curious, if you have any impacts on costs from COVID-19. Thank you.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Maybe you can try to explain what I tried to explain, Jostein, maybe it's easier.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

But sentimentally I was not.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

No. I said the right thing, but you can repeat.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}



FINAL

Yes. Now on the weather effects that we quantified per segment, that is NOK316 million overall
that we said is there. And just to be open about it both weather and COVID effects are estimates.
We don't have an accounts or claims type, which says it's weather or COVID, so this is estimates
based on our analysis of the claims patterns. On the weather effects, we've only included the
property related there and with the kind of the claims types that are typically related to cold
weather. And it hits the private and the commercial segment in Norway, as well as we have one
large loss including that very large loss above NOK30 million is included in the corporate sector in
our segment setup. So it's -- on private, we included the NOK136 million and in commercial
NOK107 million and the remainder is in corporate sector related to the large loss.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

And maybe comment the improvements for underlying frequency losses once again.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Just one explanation regarding the large losses is not one single thing. It is that within our
insurance program, we are allowed to accumulate within a certain time period all claims related to
the freeze, and that's why we kind of call this a large loss, it's also a large loss in the reinsurance
market as such, although not large enough to get those any recovery this time, since it's below the
NOK200 million general limit.
If you look at the underlying frequency loss improvements, for the private segment, and I just think
for both COVID and -- which is positive and weather which is negative, we have an underlying
improvement of 1.9 percentage points compared to 2020. And for the commercial, we have 1.0
percentage points improvement compared to first quarter of 2020 and for the group effect, 0.7
frequency loss and 0.8 on the total loss ratio.

Q - Johan Strom

{BIO 17541253 <GO>}

Okay. Fantastic. Thanks for the numbers, Jostein.

We will now take our next question. Caller, your line is open.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Hello. It's Jan Erik from ABG again. Just on the housing and claims level. Is it so that you have
discovered more local damages other than the freeze pipes that are in the housing or is it
because people are staying at home, they're actually detecting more staying at home, is that a
trend you have been seeing of late?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Could you please repeat, Jan Erik? I didn't quite capture what you have said.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

On the housing insurance claims, do you have more sort of damaging detected by people staying
at home, not the cold weather as freezing pipes may have caused, but generally, have you seen
any road damaged section as people have stayed more at home during last year than previously
and that has been reported so to speak. Is that something you have seen in your housing claims?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}



No, actually, I think, if anything, we have discussed the hypothesis that we could actually see less
kind of ordinary water damages, because people stay at home and discover it before it's a serious
loss. But I mean, we haven't tried -- we haven't managed to quantify it really. So these are kind of
truly related to the cold weather as such.

FINAL

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay. So you're actually seeing that people managed to do better housekeeping, so to speak,
while staying at home?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

This is I'd say an unquantified hypothesis we have that there could be some positive effects there.
But as I said, it's not included neither in the weather estimates nor the COVID estimates.

Hi. Good morning. It's Thomas Svendsen from SEB here. The question is just on the weather again.
Is it fair to say that it was February that was extremely cold that caused all these damages and as
March was more normal, so we don't get the risk on any time lag effects moving in to Q2?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

That's right, it's February. That was really a special month. And so it's right what you are saying.
