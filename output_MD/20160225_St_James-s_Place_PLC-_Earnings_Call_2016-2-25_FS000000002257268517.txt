MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
David Charles Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Good morning. Morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to our biannual results
presentation. As you can see from the agenda, relatively straightforward presentations
today. There are just going to be two presentations, one from Andy who will do a resume
on new business that we released on January 21 and then talk about the financial
performance, and I'll come after that and talk about the future and then we'll go into the
usual Q&As.
Because there are only two presentations, they will be slightly longer than normal, and
one in particular will be much longer than normal; that's Andy's. And he's starting for us
because not only will he do the normal results presentation, but he'll then get into a
slightly more detailed presentation around Solvency II.
So, without further ado, Mr. Croft. Thank you.

FINAL

Morning, everyone. As David said, I'm going to start with the recap of the January results
announcement. I'm then going to do the usual coverage of the results, a few words on
the dividend, and then that lovely subject of Solvency II.
So let's look back at the January new business announcement. The total single
investments, at £9.2 billion, were up 17% over the year. Retention, at 95.7%, continues to
be very strong, whilst the rate for pensions continues the recent trend of exceeding the
embedded value assumption. Consequently, as I will cover later, we have made an
operational assumption change within the EEV calculation. Net inflows of £5.8 billion, were
up 14% and represented 11% of opening funds under management, which themselves
ended the year at £58.6 billion, a new record and growth of 13%.
We also provided an update on the partnership numbers, which ended the year at 2,264,
up some 6%, whilst the total number of partners and advisers was 3,113, growth of 10%
for a second consecutive year. Whilst the investment in new advisers translates into an
expense today, it is a major lead indicator for future new business. Therefore, this 10%
growth bodes well for 2016 and future years. These new business funds under
management and adviser numbers are the key drivers of the financial performance.

Bloomberg Transcript

So let's look at the results, starting with the familiar breakdown of the EEV. The new
business profit for the year was £440.7 million, compared with £373.1 million, an increase
of 18%, reflecting the higher new business. The expected profit from the unwind of the
discount rate was £172.4 million, compared with £182 million in 2014.
Now, the unwind for 2015 was based on a discount rate of 5%, compared with 6.2% for
the prior year, with both reflecting the 10-year gilt yield at the start of each year. Had the
current year discount rate been consistent with 2014, the unwind and operating profit
would have been £41.4 million higher. There was a significant positive experience variance
of £78.1 million, compared with a similarly significant positive variance last year of £78.5
million.
Now, during the second half of the year, we completed the review of all the Group
companies that we commenced a number of years ago. This review identified further
capital losses, which are reflected as a positive £63.1 million experience variance, and this
compares with a similar benefit last year of £39.4 million.
There was also a large positive £44.1 million operating assumption change, reflecting a
change to both the pension's retention assumption and the maintenance expense
assumption, and a few words on each of these. I mentioned at the start of this
presentation that the 97% retention rate on pensions business has for a number of years
exceeded our embedded value assumption, and following the 2015 annual actuarial
investigation, this assumption has been amended to better reflect current experience.
This includes clients continuing their pension investments beyond the age of 75.
The second operating assumption change relates to the maintenance expenses. During
2015, we signed a new contract with our back office administrator which sets out the
administration charge that will apply to the business administered on the Bluedoor
Page 2 of 23

FINAL

platform. Therefore, the maintenance expense assumption has been changed to reflect
the lower tariff on the existing in-force business.
It's important to note that this change captures just the benefit to the existing business.
Additional savings on new business will also emerge within the future new business
contribution. Investment income in 2015 was £6.1 million, compared to £8.1 million, whilst
distribution contributed a negative £21.2 million, compared with a negative last year of
£10.9 million.
Now, the current distribution result was negatively impacted by the significantly higher
£20.1 million FSCS levy, by comparison with the £5.9 million last year. In addition, the costs
associated with our investment into the Asian operations, at £7 million, were higher than
the £1.7 million for the period of ownership in 2014. And if we adjusted for both of these
items in each year, there would have been a trading profit of £5.9 million for 2015,
compared to a trading loss of £3.3 million in 2014.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now, whilst we anticipate a further elevated FSCS levy of some £16 million in 2016, we do
then expect a more normalized level in future years. The back office development cost, at
£18.1 million for the year, compares with £11.9 million. Now, this change program has
continued to progress well during 2015, albeit the project is running behind and costing
more than our original plan.
During the final quarter of last year, we undertook full migration of the unit trust and ISA
business on to the new system, and we will start to see some benefits accrue in 2016.
Having successfully completed this phase of the project, during 2016 we will launch a new
retirement account and plan for the migration of the existing and pensions drawdown
business; that is, once the pension's landscape becomes clear. As we continue to develop
the system and migrate the existing business, we will incur further investment expenditure
and anticipate the cost for 2016 of a similar amount.
And finally, other contributed a negative £41.9 million, compared with £25.5 million. The
principal movements between the two years relate to share option cost, our continuing
investment in the academy and miscellaneous other items. And if we take all this into
account, the operating profit for the year was £660.2 million, up 11% compared with 2014.
Now, the fall in global stock markets during 2015 has impacted the investment return of
our funds.
However, in comparison to the falls experienced in the markets, our investment return
was only marginally below the EEV assumption, resulting in a relatively small negative
investment variance of just £24.4 million. By comparison, there was a positive variance last
year of £80.2 million.
Finally, there was a small positive economic assumption change for the year, taking pretax profit to £636.7 million and the EEV net asset value per share to 737.3p, an increase of
12%. This continues the trend of a steady increase in the net asset value per share, with
the NAV having more than doubled since the start of 2011.

FINAL

Moving now on to the underlying post-tax cash result, the net income from funds under
management, at £278.6 million, was up 18%, in line with funds under management. The
margin arising from new business was £41.7 million, up 14%, more or less in line with new
business. Now, this movement together with the growth in the EEV new business
contribution confirms we are not seeing any margin pressure.
Frustratingly, the FSCS levy reduced the post-tax cash result by £15.9 million, and other
expenses were £138.3 million. There was a benefit of £12.1 million from the utilization of
capital losses during the year. Now, this is a source of income that will continue for the
foreseeable future and there's still a benefit to accrue of £113.1 million, and we now
expect the annual contribution to be some £8 million to £10 million. Miscellaneous
contributed £3.9 million to the result, lower than the £7.6 million in 2014.
So taking all this together, the total post-cash underlying cash earnings for 2015 were
£182.1 million, up 5%. However, if we look through the operating performance adjusting for
the FSCS levy in both years, then the growth would have been 11%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now, the cash result is the building block to the IFRS result, and the current slide shows
the movement from the cash result to the underlying post-tax result. As usual, there are a
number of items accounting for the movement, including back office development, the
share option expense and the deferred tax movement, which for both years includes the
benefit of the capital losses I mentioned earlier. The underlying result is then adjusted for
the movement in the DAC and DIR and PVIF to provide the IFRS profit before shareholder
tax.
Moving now on to the dividend, at the half year we increased the interim dividend by 20%
and indicated that the full-year dividend would increase by a similar amount. I'm therefore
pleased to confirm that the final dividend will be increased by 20%, providing a full-year
dividend of 27.96p. This represents a payout ratio to underlying cash of 80%. However,
looking through the increase in the FSCS levy, the payout ratio would have been 76%.
Looking forward, we fully intend to continue our policy of increasing the dividend in line
with the underlying performance of the business, with the comfort of the £19.2 billion of
funds within the gestation period which will begin to contribute to the cash result as each
cohort reaches its seventh year. We also have the added comfort of the dividend buffer.
I now want to move on to Solvency. I know you've been waiting for this bit. As you know,
Solvency II replaced the Solvency I regime with effect from January 1 this year. The main
difference between the two regimes is a greater focus on risk and risk management.
Consequently, assets and liabilities are assessed on a realistic basis, with appropriate
capital set aside to cover risks inherent within the business.
Now, SJP is a unit-linked fee-based model and we have always had a low appetite for risk,
so we have no exposure to options, guarantees or longevity risk and little, by the way, of
mortality or morbidity risk. These factors, together with our prudent approach to investing
surplus assets, served us well in the Solvency I world, with our solvency remaining robust
throughout the business cycle.

FINAL

Company N ame: St James' s Place PL C
Company Ticker: STJ L N Equity
Date: 2016-02-25

And for the last time, let's remind ourselves of the Solvency I calculation at the end of
December 2015. Our unit-linked liabilities are matched with equivalent unit-linked assets.
Now, very importantly, this will not change in the Solvency II world, so our liabilities to
clients will continue to be matched with corresponding assets. And after allowing for
intergroup dividends at the end of the year, the life companies have net assets of £198.5
million and the Group has total assets of £518.5 million. The total Solvency capital
requirement was £78.3 million, resulting in Group free assets on a Solvency I basis of
£440.2 million, a strong Solvency position.
As we move into the Solvency II world, the risk profile that has served us so well under
Solvency I continues to serve us well, and we have not needed to use any of the
permitted transitional provisions. So the first important message about Solvency II is that it
hasn't altered our business, our risk profile, nor how we look at capital levels. It's more
about some presentational changes together with a number of very large moving parts,
and I will now take you through the changes, what they mean and their presentational
impact.

Bloomberg Transcript

The current slide takes us from Solvency I net assets to the Solvency II net asset position,
and there are a number of adjustments required. Firstly, £46.9 million of Solvency I
actuarial reserves are not required under Solvency II. Secondly, deferred tax assets of
£175.6 million, not allowable in the Solvency I world, are included under Solvency II. And
thirdly, there are a few other minor adjustments, resulting in Solvency II net assets of
£722.4 million. Therefore, our Solvency net assets are £204 million higher.
We then bring in the expected future emergence of profit, the VIF, of some £2.3 billion,
together with a risk margin of £624 million. This all adds up to total Solvency II assets or
own funds of some £2.4 billion. The Solvency capital requirement under Solvency II is £1.6
billion, giving solvency free assets of £809.2 million, compared to the Solvency I free
assets you saw earlier of £440.2 million. So another key message is that the Solvency II
free assets are £369 million higher under Solvency II, a very robust position.
Now, almost all of this increase in the free assets arises within the life companies, and I'll
come back to that in a moment. Now, here's the peculiarity. When we calculate the
Solvency ratio, that's own funds, shown as A, divided by the Solvency capital requirement,
shown as B, we get a ratio of 151%, lower than the Solvency I position despite the higher
free assets.
Now, this is not a point to be concerned about and the ratio is not the most appropriate
measure for unit linked fee business like ours. And the VIF, risk margin and Solvency capital
requirement are closely correlated, so as the VIF increases, then the risk margin
increases, the Solvency capital requirement increases and the free assets also increase.
So the financials are in better shape, yet oddly the Solvency ratio falls.
And to reinforce this point, let's look at a real sensitivity, a 10% reduction in funds under
management. Here is the Solvency position for the Group again, and let's look what
happens. Well, firstly, and importantly, the net assets do not change. They remain £722.4
million. In fact, they would barely change if funds under management were down 20%,

Page 5 of 23

Company Ticker: STJ L N Equity
Date: 2016-02-25

FINAL

30% or 50%. Equally, they are insensitive to interest rate movements and also
persistency. Our net assets are very resilient.
If you look at the Solvency free assets, unsurprisingly, they are lower. However, the
Solvency ratio has actually increased to 153%. And the opposite also occurs, so the
Solvency ratio increases as the free assets decrease and therefore the business is
arguably less robust. So the important point here to make about Solvency II is that the
Solvency ratio is not the most appropriate measure for SJP. Instead, we will be focusing on
the level, quality and resilience of the net assets.
So what does all this mean and how does the Board look at the capital position? Well,
nothing has changed except for the life companies, and here we will continue to hold unit
linked assets sufficient to cover unit linked liabilities, meaning that client liabilities are
covered. And in addition, we will hold liquid net assets to cover a minimum Management
Solvency Buffer of £150 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now, why £150 million? Well, this buffer has been set having regard to a number of
factors, not least the results from the stress and scenario testing carried out as part of our
own risk and solvency assessment. And as an aside, this Management Solvency Buffer of
£150 million is at a similar level to a buffer we historically held under Solvency I. This was
not to be unexpected as, as I said earlier, neither the business nor the risk profile has
changed.
So where does this leave us? Well, as I said, nothing has changed in the business other
than we are now reporting an increased free assets within the life business of £370 million
– to £526.5 million. However, the net of the VIF, the risk margin and the Solvency capital
requirement amounts to £113 million. This is not a liquid asset but intangible, so let's
deduct it for internal capital purposes. Similarly, the £170.3 million deferred tax asset is not
liquid, albeit over time it will be realized. So let's also deduct this for internal capital
purposes. This leaves us with liquid assets of £243.2 million. And just to be clear, these
liquid assets consist of UK gilts, AAA rated money market funds and short-term bank
deposits; the resilience point again. Taking all this into account, we are therefore holding
£93.2 million of liquid assets over our Management Solvency Buffer, a very resilient
position.
So, to summarize the key messages on Solvency II, the nature of our business has not
changed; nor has our risk profile. Solvency II net assets are higher by some £200 million,
while Solvency II free assets are higher by £370 million. Despite the higher free assets,
the Solvency ratio of 151% is lower than under Solvency I. However, the ratio is not the best
measure for a unit linked life business like ours. What is important is the level, quality and
resilience of the net assets, and our net assets are very resilient.
So that's me done. 2015 was another strong operating year, with the key highlights
summarized on the current slide. The two key takeaways for me have to be the 20%
proposed increase in the full-year dividend and the higher Group net and free assets
under Solvency II.

Thank you, Andy. Thank you for that enlightening presentation on Solvency II. Andy has cut
a video on the topic, so if any of you want to go back into Solvency II at any time, there's a
nice just under 10 minute video that he produced on Friday. I confess to not having seen it
yet. I did say to him on Monday, 'What does it look like?' and he came in rather pleased
with himself, saying 'Actually, I think I come across quite well and look quite good on
screen.'
So I'm not sure he's going to get the call from Hollywood any time soon, but it sounds like
it's a good video to watch. So it will be up, posted on line, seriously, later today. Thank
you. I'd like to – he's not looking at me very pleased right now, so.

Bloomberg Transcript

I'd like to start by just reflecting on the results that we've achieved for a few minutes and
putting them into some context in relation to the market. It's worth remembering that the
FTSE 100 fell for the second consecutive time in 2015, two years of negative growth for
that particular index. During that time, we've seen our funds under management grow
from £44.3 billion to £58.6 billion.
The picture is equally impressive when looking at the last 10 years. I don't know how many
of you noticed that the day before our annual Company meeting which we held on
January 22, the FTSE 100 was exactly the same level that it was 10 years ago, to the day.
Total shareholder returns would have been circa 45% including dividends, but
nevertheless the FTSE index was at the same level 10 years on. In that period, though, our
funds under management grew from £12 billion to over £56 billion, a 350% increase, and
clients invested our then managed fund portfolios would have exceeded the FTSE TSR
return by almost 50%.
Furthermore, the 20% increase in gross inflows in the final quarter of 2015 was the 15th
consecutive quarter of growth, four years of quarter-on-quarter growth in gross inflows.
The track record is even more impressive in terms of net inflows per quarter. The £1.6
billion of net inflows in the final quarter of 2015 was the 40th consecutive quarter of
positive net inflows in the last 10 years. And in case you've missed the point, that means
we haven't missed one quarter of positive net inflows in that 10-year period.
Both of those records are the real demonstration of the resilience of our business, and
despite recent market volatility, I don't expect us to lose those records in this quarter.
Such is the current level of activity in the partnership right now. I hope those comments
don't come across as us sounding complacent. That clearly isn't my intention. It's simply
that I just want to stress just how resilient this business is. You've seen it in 2008 and
2009, again in 2011, and I suspect you'll see it once more in 2016.
That resilience is in part driven by the simplicity of our business model, the number of
partners times productivity per partner. As we continue to grow the number of partners
and they in turn grow their businesses, we can expect to grow the overall business. As we

often say, the business model is simple, simple but not easy. For us to recruit new
partners and practices and keep them, we have to ensure that St. James's Place is the
place to be. We have to ensure that we remain very focused on supporting them and
their clients and making our proposition the best it can be for both communities. That's
why we spend so much time on our investment approach.
Having launched two new funds in 2015, that's the Diversified Bond and Strategic Income
funds, we now offer over 60 independent investment professionals from across the
globe, many only available to partners and clients of St. James's Place. Offering a rich
selection of investment professionals is only part of the story, though. Ultimately, it's
results that matter, and we clearly need to retain the quality and level of our performance
if we are to attract and retain clients.

Bloomberg Transcript

In 2015, our UK Equity Fund managers performed well, with all but one outperforming the
market. And of the six that did outperform, five did so by more than 5%. Similarly, our
North American, International and European funds have again produced good returns, as
did a number of other funds including property and absolute return funds. Of course,
clients don't typically invest in individual funds. The introduction of our model portfolios
four years ago has provided a better risk/return balance, embracing both the benefits of
diversification and active management. Over 90% of new client investments today find
their way into portfolios in one way or another, with the majority going into our model
portfolios.
Since their introduction four years ago, clients have seen their investments grow by
between 5% and 10% per annum, outperforming the ARC private client indices. And to
remind you, the ARC figures, like our own, are after all charges and cover all of our major
competitors. So we can be satisfied that our focus on delivering outperformance for our
clients, despite some challenging market conditions, is achieving results. However, as
David Lamb explained at our annual company meeting, investing is personal to each client
and the same is true of the service they receive from us via their partners. Giving partners
the flexibility to provide a service to their clients that meets their requirements is
important if we're to achieve such personal service.
Whilst we believe we do just that, we regularly seek feedback from clients to ensure
we're meeting their expectations of both us and of our partners. The survey that
accompanies the annual wealth accounts sent to clients at the beginning of every year is
the most effective way we do that. Whilst we don't have all the results from this year's
survey, we have had over 30,000 responses so far, so a more than representative
sample. And as it happens, the results are remarkably similar to previous years, with
practically all questions generating over 90% satisfaction levels.
90% of clients have met with their partner in the last one to two years. 92% of clients feel
that they've received the right amount of face-to-face communication. 98% of clients
perceive the value for money offered by our proposition is either reasonable, good or
excellent, with 80% in the good or excellent categories. 95% of clients would recommend
SJP to their colleagues or friends and just short of 60% say they already have. So some
excellent results but, as always, some room for improvement.

As in previous years, we've also taken the opportunity to ask a few other questions. Some
were free format, which will take some time to analyze, but one or two were multiple
choice, with the most topical being about pensions. Two-thirds of those who had thought
about the subject thought that maintaining tax relief on pension contributions was the
most effective way of encouraging future generations to save for their retirement. And
linked to that question, over 20% of those still saving for retirement aren't confident at
this stage that they will have sufficient funds for their retirement and so recognize the
need to save more.
We also asked about intergenerational matters and we're encouraged by our clients'
interest in the transfer of wealth to younger members of families, specialist probate
services, intergenerational mortgages and educational initiatives for younger members of
their families, all of which will form part of the intergenerational project we've initiated for
this year. Returning to the question of pensions for a moment, in a few weeks time the
Chancellor will update us on his intentions following the consultation initiated last year.
You'll no doubt remember the debate centered around EET versus TEE; in other words,
tax relief on the way in or tax free on the way out.

Bloomberg Transcript

Whilst there's clearly a possibility that he'll decide to adopt the more radical TEE
approach, most industry commentators, journalists and indeed many Tory MPs seem to
favor retaining tax relief, albeit with a flatter structure. That's certainly our preference, not
because either approach will have a material effect on our business, but because the
alternative will almost certainly lead to years of a complex transition from one regime to
another, and on top of an already complex pension's regime.
Some might argue that that might be good for an adviser based business like ours, and it
probably would, but we believe it would be the wrong answer for society. The fact
remains that people are living longer, aren't saving enough and need more
encouragement to do so, not less.
The other major review underway is of course the Financial Advice Market Review, or
FAMR, as it's known. We've been actively engaged in this review and whilst not directly
affected, have encouraged the review sponsors to think carefully before radical change.
Many people think that the call for the review was triggered by the recent pensions
freedom legislation and was responding to concerns over clients ability to access advice
about their new found freedoms, and specifically prior to encashing their pension funds,
i.e., the so-called advice gap.
Consequently, and in response to FAMR, providers are now asking for more flexibility and
clarity over their ability to give generic advice to clients with smallish pension funds without
falling foul of the somewhat burdensome regulated advice market that exists post-RDR.
We can expect an update from The Treasury around the time of the budget, but as with
the tax relief point, we don't believe the outcome will have any impact on our business.
That assessment is also supported by some recent facts released by the ABI. In the first
six months post the implementation of pension's freedom, some £2.5 billion was paid out
in lump sums, with an average of around £15,000. £2.5 billion was paid out in income

Page 9 of 23

FINAL

drawdown payments. The average there was £3,600. £2.85 billion invested in drawdown
plans and £2.17 billion invested into annuities.
And what's interesting about this next chart is the fact that the amounts of money moving
from pension funds to somewhere else hasn't changed that much in recent years,
although income drawdown is becoming much more popular. And as the pie chart
demonstrates, the same is true for our business. More clients are leaving their money
invested with us in those drawdown products, hence our improved retention figures.
One of the other consequences of pension's freedom has been to raise the profile of
exit charges that are applied to regular contribution pension plans that do not run their full
course. In other words, where the plan holder contracts to pay into their pension plan for a
certain number of years, typically referred to as up to their selected retirement age, and
subsequently either retires before that contracted date or simply wants to access their
pension fund early, but after age 55.

Bloomberg Transcript

The FCA have now been tasked with the job of implementing some form of cap or
fairness limit on such charges, and we understand they plan to communicate further with
us later in March. We don't expect a material effect on our business, whatever the
outcome of that cap.
Let me now change track and say a few words about Bluedoor, the new platform
technology we're implementing in our back office. As Andy has explained, it is running a
little late and over budget. Such is often the way of large IT projects. Nevertheless, the
first phase has been successfully implemented and all of our substantial unit trust & ISA
business is now being processed on the Bluedoor platform and has been for several
months now. £8 billion worth of units and over 300 million lines of data were successfully
migrated from the old system in October last year.
As some of you will have heard me say at our annual Company meeting, we've
encountered some teething problems and the scale of the change has had an impact on
some of our service levels in our administration centers, all of which are or have been
addressed. Looking forward, this year we'll implement our new retirement account onto
Bluedoor, which means we'll begin to process new business for those accounts also, and
that will be followed by our bond business in 2017.
The business case for Bluedoor remains compelling, substantially improving the service
delivered to partners and clients alike, whilst at the same time reducing our admin cost for
each investment, both our in-force book and for our new business. We're not there yet in
terms of completion, but we're well on the way.
Elsewhere, I'm delighted to say that we've received the final change of control clearance
from the regulators for the acquisition of Rowan Dartington. That means our plans to roll
out the new services to the partnership next month remain firmly on track, and we look
forward to working closely with Graham and his team. We'll feature an in-depth look at
Rowan Dartington and its potential added value to the Group at our next Capital Markets
Day, which we're scheduling for the end of April.

FINAL

And finally from me, a few words on partnership growth. You will have seen the growth in
the number of partners and advisers in 2015, up 6.2% and 9.8%, respectively. Both really
bode well for growth in new business in the coming years. The drivers for this growth are
in part our normal recruitment activity, in part the increased influence of our regional
academies and in part our expansion into Asia, all of which are delivering very much in line
with or above our expectations. But it's also, importantly, in part down to our improved
partner retention in recent years.
This latter point is not something we've dwelt on in our results presentation, but it is worth
pointing out that despite our scale and despite increased competition in the marketplace,
fewer partners left us in both 2014 and 2015 than in any of the previous 18 years, in
absolute terms. And given our scale now, I think that's quite remarkable and testimony to
the work that our entire community do, supporting the partnership and making St.
James's Place the place to be.
As I said at the start of this presentation, we have a business model that not only delivers
substantial growth in stable market, but also consistently delivers and demonstrates
resilience in tougher conditions, further evidence of its predictability, a word I've often
used in these presentations. And those are the qualities that have enabled us to continue
to report good growth in all of our key measures and another set of strong results today.

Bloomberg Transcript

I'll leave you with a summary of those results and ask my colleagues to join me on the
platform to take any questions you may have. Thank you.

Q&A
A - David Charles Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

We have some roving mics, so I don't know who wants to go first with the questions.
Hello. We've got one or two. So do you want to come down the middle here and work
your way down to start? Never mind. Sorry, yes.

Q - Ravi Tanna

{BIO 16926941 <GO>}

It's Ravi Tanna here from Goldman Sachs. I have three questions, please. The first one
was just on Bluedoor. You've referenced the fact that it's a little bit behind schedule and
over cost budget. Could you give us perhaps a sense of what the quantum of benefits
are likely to be that will accrue from that eventually and over what kind of timeframe?
The second question was just on the implementation of pension freedoms and also
changes to the annual tax allowance that's coming in in April. I was just wondering if you
could give us a sense of whether there's been any material uptick in pension activity
flows, et cetera, in anticipation of that change in limit.
And the third one was on the announcement around the expansion of the academy and
the office in Canary Wharf. I was just wondering whether there would be material costs
attached to that. Thank you.

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Okay. Andy, do you want to talk about Bluedoor and the benefits and how they'll
materialize, and then David can pick up pensions freedom.

FINAL

A - Andrew Martin Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

So we currently pay a tariff to our third party administrators of around about £60 million a
year. I think it's £55 million, £56 million, let's call it £60 million a year. We would expect to
see savings on those numbers of somewhere between 10% and 15%. So let's say we
expect to see annual savings on the existing business and existing volumes of
somewhere between £6 million and £8 million a year. We won't get all those in 2016,
because obviously only the unit trusts and ISA business are on the platform.
Now, those numbers will continue to increase as more new business is put onto the
system, so over the term of the contract there should be material savings. As well, as
David said, that's not just the sole reason for doing it. Its future proofing the business and
enhancing client and partner experience.

A - David Charles Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Thanks, Andy. David, do you want to talk about pensions and -

Bloomberg Transcript

A - David John Lamb

{BIO 15016583 <GO>}

Yes. So if you look at – first of all, take pensions freedoms, for example, there's two real
benefits in pensions freedoms. The first one is it just reignited enthusiasm in the
marketplace, understanding what your options were at age 55, and you saw that business
mix last year in terms of increase in drawdown business.
And rather oddly, you could always do that, but it just generated that interest in the
marketplace in terms of people saying, okay, I don't have to annuitize, what shall I do next,
and looking for advice was a then consequence of that. So the business shift you saw last
year, I think you'll see more of that this year, pensions being a big market going forward.
The contribution point was well trailed, so they had 12 months of people knowing this
contribution change was going to come. So again, the partnership were very active in that
period. You'll see that all the way through to end of this tax year and it will carry on.
Beyond that, we'll see what happens in the tax year. So the crucial thing for going forward
will be what changes are going to be announced in the budget. And as David said before,
whether it's EET or TEE, we'll deal with that when we get the news about it in middle of
March.

A - David Charles Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Now, you mentioned Canary Wharf and the academy. They're unrelated. So Canary Wharf
isn't about the academy. Ian, just to even this up nicely, can talk a little bit about Canary
Wharf and why we are doing Canary Wharf. And cost wise, Andy can come back and talk
about how that finds its way into our expense overhead.

A - Ian Stewart Gascoigne

{BIO 4439479 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes. Canary Wharf was in response to the pressure we've got on our existing London
premises. We've not opened or expanded into London for 15 years any new premises or
space. So opening Canary Wharf allows us some new floor space to house new partners,
graduates from the existing academy looking for office space. And that also, tied with one
or two other changes in the Kingsway office and the City office, mean that we've kind of
got a bit more room to breathe in London than we had previously.

A - David Charles Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Thanks, Ian. It's actually the first time we've expanded our office premises anywhere in the
country for 15 years. It's quite a significant move in terms of the way in which the
partnership is developing and the volume of people that come out of the academy that
we need to house. Andy, do you want to talk about the expense side of -?

A - Andrew Martin Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Yes. So as you all know, our standard sort of working assumption is establishment costs
increasing by about 10% a year. Our budget for 2016 will see those establishment costs
increasing by 11% as a result of the new premises. In terms of the academy, we expect the
academy to be around £7.5 million investment next year – this year.

A - David Charles Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. So can we come on down through the middle and just – thank you.

Q - Lance M. Burbidge

{BIO 3978332 <GO>}

Thanks. It's Lance Burbidge from Autonomous. I think I've got three questions as well.
Firstly, in a simplistic calculation, if you look at gross flows they were up 17% year on year,
but partner remuneration was up only 8%. So does that mean that people are doing more
for less? So I wonder if you could comment on that.
Secondly, on the dividend payout ratio of 80%, are you intending to drop that to 75% this
year? So does that give you a headwind? And then could you just expand on the benefits
of the new retirement account, what it delivers in terms of flexibility?

A - David Charles Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Okay. Just pick up the dividend, I'll save Andy, because it's a quick one, payout ratio 80%.
If you look through the FSCS levy, it's 76% payout ratio. So we are there or thereabouts
with our guided ratio of around 75%. And we've said quite clearly we expect that dividend
to grow in line with the underlying growth of the business, so that there is the normal
trajectory on that. On gross inflows versus partner remuneration, not something I've
picked up. Ian, I don't know if you want to just -?

A - Ian Stewart Gascoigne

{BIO 4439479 <GO>}

I think there's a situation where we're beginning to see a small amount of discounting at
point of sale by partners, so they would argue they're having to do more for the same.
Page 13 of 23



Company N ame: St James' s Place PL C
Company Ticker: STJ L N Equity
Date: 2016-02-25

Analysis of that shows it involves probably maybe 20% of cases and the discount is
approximately on average about 20%. That may well be with the larger pieces of business
that there's a bit of price pressure there. So that is partly to do with the disconnect
between the gross inflows and the partner remuneration.

FINAL

A - Andrew Martin Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Could I just add, sorry, one extra bit on the dividend, because I covered it in my talk. We
also have the gestation period, so that money is coming through in 2016. And we also
have, as we've talked before about, a dividend buffer. So we have the ability to allow the
payout ratio to increase for short periods of time. In fact, if you go back to 2008 and
2009, that's exactly what we did.

A - David John Lamb

{BIO 15016583 <GO>}

Shall I pick up the retirement account?

A - David Charles Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Please.

A - David John Lamb

{BIO 15016583 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So if you look at pensions, the evolution of pensions, because of the way the legislation
has evolved over the last 15 years, 20 years, your ability to accumulate and then deaccumulate money was in different contracts and so it's quite a lumpy process and we've
always known that.
So we can handle pension flexibility, but it isn't as smooth as you'd like it to be, and the
retirement account brings everything into a single account. So you can accumulate, deaccumulate, mix and match, and you don't have to move physically from one contract
structure to another contract structure. And it just makes it a much better client
experience and partner experience, and that's what's going to happen.

A - David Charles Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Come on down, yes.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Thanks very much. Andy Hughes from Macquarie. Given your comment you made about
drawdown and moving from one contract to another, is Lance's question also distorted by
moving to drawdown? Doesn't that move money into the gross flows but doesn't impact
partner remuneration?
The second question is I think you said the performance data you showed was net of all
charges. Does that include the bid/offer spread and partner remuneration, et cetera, or
because the financial express data we normally see is just fund management charges?
Thank you.

FINAL

The investment performance data, yes.

A - David Charles Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Yes, yes. David, do you want to pick that up on the -?

A - David John Lamb

{BIO 15016583 <GO>}

I missed the second part. I didn't understand what you said at the end there, Andy, so can
you just clarify that?

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

So when I look at the financial express data, which shows fund performance, it normally
misses out the bid/offer spread and the other contract related charge, and I think you said
that that data was all charges. And when was the commencement of these things again,
remind me? Was it three years ago or -?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - David John Lamb

{BIO 15016583 <GO>}

All of our fund data is charge data we use. Financial express is just a window through
which we push this data out there. We always show our data from the client perspective
after all charges. So the data the client sees on our holdings, for example, is their net
return after costs, and we take that back to the client report.
So I think that's very clear in terms of how we compare. I think the challenge which people
have in the industry is because we're vertically integrated, all of our costs are wrapped
into a single annual management charge, whereas if you're a client going through a
broker and a platform your costs are in different places and you can't see net of all costs
what actually has happened to your return on your account.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

I guess what's surprising me is you're showing a 6% annual return for the defensive fund
gross charges, if you think the charges are 3% a year, roughly, which doesn't seem clear.

A - David John Lamb

{BIO 15016583 <GO>}

They're not, though. So I'm very happy to pick it up and take you through it outside, but
that's not the right charges anyway.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Okay. And the distortion from drawdown?

A - David John Lamb

{BIO 15016583 <GO>}

FINAL

I don't think, 80% of our drawdown business is external coming to SJP today. So there's
no distortion in terms of gross flows. I think the challenge going forward for existing clients
in their retirement account is that that won't count as new premium income going forward.
That's 20% of the business. So the bulk of the business and a growing part of the
business is the external stuff coming in.

A - David Charles Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Thanks, David. Yes. So we'll just come on down through.

Q - Jon M. Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Jon Hocking from Morgan Stanley. I've got three questions, please. Just on the dividend, I
can see you on the sort of 75% cash payout. Now we've got the Solvency II numbers out
of the way, I just wondered to what extent you expect that Solvency II ratio to grow over
time and are we now in a position where we can start thinking about special dividends in
the medium term, given we're still retaining cash every year. That's the first question.

Bloomberg Transcript

Second question, on the embedded value numbers, there's a few operating assumption
changes. The unit trust business has got a big positive which I think is partly expenses. I
just wondered if there's anything else in that number. And then the life business has got a
small operating assumption change which is negative. I wonder if you can explain that.
And then just finally, on Rowan Dartington, you say you're going to launch the product
through the network next month. I just wondered how you're going to do that. Is this
going to be something where your normal client is still going to be in the model portfolio
world and it's going to be something which is for specific clients, for new partners that
maybe have joined, or is it going to be something to be available as a mainstream
option? And what is the margin consequences of that? Thank you.

A - David Charles Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Okay, so two. Andy, do you want to pick up the financials? And David, who is overseeing
the Rowan Dartington transition, can pick up the second point so.

A - Andrew Martin Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Okay. If I do the EEV one first, this all relates to the new tariffs that have been agreed with
the third party administrator. So I think, from recollection, the tariff in the life company is
going up marginally and the tariff in the trust company is coming down by more, and
hence you get different experience in those two.
In terms of Solvency II and the dividend, we will continue to show a cash result which will
look incredibly similar to what you see now. But rather than being a movement between
two Solvency I balance sheets, it will be a movement between two Solvency II balance
sheets. So the underlying cash will continue to behave and generate it how you're familiar
with.

Page 16 of 23



Company N ame: St James' s Place PL C
Company Ticker: STJ L N Equity
Date: 2016-02-25

One of the slides I showed at the end there says that we've got £92.3 million of liquid
assets over and above what we believe is the appropriate Solvency buffer, and we will be
reflecting on that and having discussions on that throughout this year and into next year.

FINAL

A - David John Lamb

{BIO 15016583 <GO>}

On Rowan Dartington, I guess there's probably three points to make. The first one is the
big opportunity of St. James's Place and Dartington working together is the new market
that we don't touch today, which is parallel to the market that St. James's Place has always
operated in. And estimates vary between £300 billion and £400 billion of assets sitting in
what is a fragmented world of stockbroking type portfolios.
We believe that with our distribution capability through the partnership, we can introduce
that type of business to our clients and indeed find more clients in that marketplace than
would otherwise want to come and talk to St. James's Place. So it's an additional service,
an additional market.

Bloomberg Transcript

The second point to make is we've been doing this for a little while by introducing
business in the past for people like Quilter Cheviot in a sort of less focused way. Now we
have Rowan Dartington in the Group, we'll make this much more available as a toolkit for
the rest of the partnership who have clients for whom it's appropriate. And that's the third
point. Not all clients will be appropriate for this.
So we start the rollout in March with about the first batch of 50 partners, and we'll
gradually increase the number of partners that have become accredited in this area. And
they will be the ones that have got business experience or are more likely to have clients
who want this service alongside the existing SJP service. It's a very complementary way to
develop our business. It allows us to have a deep relationship with some clients and
access new clients who otherwise we couldn't access.

Q - Jon M. Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

And the portfolios – are those portfolios constructed from funds which have been
approved in the normal way or are those single name stocks, or can it be anything?

A - David John Lamb

{BIO 15016583 <GO>}

The Rowan Dartington setup is very similar to – currently very similar to most stockbroking
setups in the UK. So you end up with direct equities in UK. It could easily end up with
pooled funds for non-UK equities. They select their own pooled fund range using their
own investment committee inside Rowan Dartington. As we take this journey together, we
will bring together the investment philosophies of the two groups so that there is a single
unified presentation to our client about how these things sit side by side.

A - David Charles Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Thank you. Right. Two more in here.

Alan Devlin from Barclays. Two questions. First of all, it wasn't clear on how the dividend
buffer and the management solvency buffer align. Is the dividend buffer within that, or is
that over and above?

FINAL

And the second question, you haven't mentioned your international operations today. And
Asia was going and also I saw in this morning about opening a Middle East office in the
next couple of years. Thanks.

A - David Charles Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Okay. Well, let me deal with the second one first and then Andy can come back to the
dividend buffer. Asia is going fine. It's going absolutely fine, as I've tried to talk about at
the end in terms of recruitment, about growing that distribution. Distribution grew by
60%, big number. It started from a small base in 2015. We've got similar ambitions for
2016, and bit by bit we are making the right sort of progress in the Far East.

Bloomberg Transcript

And so far as the Middle East is concerned, we are still in exploration territory, so we're
talking to some people out there. We pretty much deliberately slowed it down because
we've got quite a few things that we want to focus on, the existing Asia. Rowan
Dartington wasn't on the table 12 months ago and so there are things for us to do. So the
Middle East proposition, if we go ahead with it, as I said in my CEO statement, will be
early part of 2017. We'll carry on the exploration this year and see where we get to. So, no
fundamental shift, just a different order of priority. Gave you time to think about the
dividend buffer.

A - Andrew Martin Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

No, no, no, no. I guess in hindsight using the word buffer for two different things probably
wasn't the brightest thing to do, and they are distinctly different. So if you look at the life
company, within the life company, as I showed on one of the slides, the liquid assets were
£243.2 million. Inside the life company, we believe we need to hold a Solvency buffer of
£150 million. So that's a Solvency comment.
Then outside of the life companies and the Group, we've always held a cash reserve in
order to smooth out the dividend, which we've called the dividend buffer. But it's totally
different. It's a cash reserve. And for instance, what we did in 2008 and 2009, we were
able to use that dividend reserve, which is what I shall call it from now on, to help continue
paying the dividend. Is that clear?

Q - Alan G. Devlin

{BIO 5936254 <GO>}

Yes.

Okay. Oliver here and then we've got two down the front.

Q - Oliver George Nigel Steel

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

FINAL

Oliver Steel from Deutsche Bank. I apologize for missing the first part of your
presentation, so maybe you said this, but the Bluedoor delay, is that going to cost you any
more in development costs in 2016 or is that at least out of the way?
And then secondly, the intergenerational project, are you expecting that to lead to a lot of
extra inflows or is it really just adding fee revenues around the existing outlets?

A - David Charles Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

I think it's – if I deal with that one, Andy can talk about consequences of Bluedoor in terms
of the finances. But the intergenerational, it's about deepening the relationship with our
clients, frankly. People will talk about the next generation. As our client's age and some of
their wealth is passed on to the next generation, we want to engage with that generation.
Some of the intergenerational services are about added value to our partners and to their
clients. That's the main motivation.

Bloomberg Transcript

I wouldn't see it as being additive in the sense of its going to add to the already sort of
ambitious 15% goals that we set ourselves, but they'll definitely be supportive of that
delivery. And not inconsistent with the way in which we are encouraging next generation
people into our academy and bringing through a younger contingent of advisers to marry
up with some of these intergenerational opportunities. So that's what that's about.
Bluedoor taking a bit longer and costing a bit more, Andy?

A - Andrew Martin Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

Yes. The Bluedoor costs you see are essentially people times time. And therefore, if the
project is taking longer, people times time means that there is also costs coming through
in 2016. And we would expect them to be probably of a similar amount to 2015.

A - David Charles Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

We've got two more questions at the front here, and then we'll -.

Q - Andrew Sinclair

{BIO 17749036 <GO>}

Thanks. It's Andrew Sinclair from Merrill Lynch. Firstly, just on your pensions gross flows,
just to get a bit of clarification. Firstly, how much of the pensions gross flows would
typically be transfer values?
And secondly, as they actually come into St. James's Place, how many of them would be
getting a 40% or 45% actual uplift at that stage? Just final question would be on the
money management accounts, just wondered if you could give us an update on what's
been seen there.

Sure. David, do you want to take the pensions? I'm not sure I understood the 40% bit -

A - David John Lamb

FINAL

I'll handle it, sorry.

A - David Charles Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Yes, yes.

A - David John Lamb

{BIO 15016583 <GO>}

Pensions transfers, they come to us as gross funds from another pension scheme, so
there's no uplift in terms of tax relief. It's already in the pension scheme before it comes
across. And if you look at our pensions single contributions, which includes transfers,
something like 75% of that business is external transfers coming to SJP. As opposed to
cash, rather, and in others cash.

A - Andrew Martin Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

But are people contributing...

Bloomberg Transcript

A - David John Lamb

{BIO 15016583 <GO>}

Right, okay. Just to avoid any misunderstanding, when you make a contribution to a
pension scheme, let's say you want £100 to go in your pension scheme, you give us £80
and we get £20 tax relief, basic rate tax relief, from the revenue, okay. If you're a higher
rate taxpayer, you get your extra tax relief through your tax code in your tax account. We
get our gross flow at £100, £80 from you, £20 from the revenue.
So when we come to talk about pension tax changes next March, don't get spooked by
going from 45% higher rate relief to basic rate flat, say 25%, because our net flows and
gross flows don't move. Your tax code changes. So it's different for you; it's not different
for SJP. I'm happy to take you through the maths on that.

Q - Andrew Sinclair

{BIO 17749036 <GO>}

Thank you.

A - David Charles Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

On the money management account, yes, a bit like we're going to with Rowan
Dartington, because such is our way, we play into these things quite carefully, testing the
service and the whole experience from a client perspective. We limited our entry to those
people who have more than £0.5 million invested with us, which is a natural sort of brake
on the rollout.
Last figures I saw, over £50 million of secured facility has been made available and nearly
£40 million of that has been drawn down. So people are using the product. We will take
the level down, if we haven't already done so, to £0.25 million of funds under

management. And it's through Metro Bank and that relationship that we'll explore the sort
of intergenerational product, mortgage product that we talk about to enable it, parents or
grandparents to help their offspring and their dependents to get on the property ladder
as appropriate, with joint mortgages and guarantors made easier for them. So,
relationships going well, gently, gently as we crank these things up.
One more question there, I think, and then I think we'll – and David's at the back. David,
we'll give you the last one.

Q - Paul De'Ath
Yes. Hi there. Paul De'ath from RBC. Couple of things. Just on the Solvency II ratio, to go
back to that, I appreciate the ratio itself isn't necessarily the number you want to focus on,
but some people will obviously look at it and you'll need to manage that number to some
extent. Are there any stresses that you've applied to the ratio as you go through it that it's
particularly sensitive to, because clearly the funds under management dropping it's not –
or it's positively sensitive to, but what's the biggest risk scenario for that ratio?

A - David Charles Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Sorry, go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Paul De'Ath
And then just the second question, just going back to Bluedoor again and the teething
problems that you mentioned that are now fixed. But do you feel you have had any
reputational damage through the process of hitting those teething problems, any clients
who are upset about what's happened or anything like that?

A - David Charles Bellamy

{BIO 14025555 <GO>}

Well, again, let me get rid of the second question. I'll deal with the second question first.
Getting a little bit of media coverage over a client whose pension payment, which
ironically is nothing to do with Bluedoor, get some coverage on that, was not a great
moment for us, but it was one little moment. We then had some typically IFA trade press
that liked to take the opportunity to have a little pop, I guess, and that's what they do.
And so you saw little lines in some of the wires that talked about systems crashing; they
didn't. They talked about clients being left stranded; they haven't been.
There's a bit of – on this particular subject of pensions, there is an automated report that
the industry is sharing called the option system, which actually reports the length of time it
takes for pension transfers to pay or pension freedoms to pay. We are one of the
quickest. Our track record that came out just last week is nine and a bit days. You look at
some of the companies and the graph goes up like this, with companies taking much,
much longer.
So it was embarrassing, don't like it. One of the things we were really keen to see is how
our clients reacted in the wealth account. Every year for the last six years, we've gone out
with an annual wealth account and a survey to every single client saying tell us how we're

doing, and you saw the results. 95% would recommend us, dropped a couple of percent
from last year, but no material comments on the administration.
It's one of the real joys of our partnership model. Partners are where we are having the
issues with, because partners are having to work harder and deal with some of the stuff
that's come out as a result of those teething problems. I suspect the vast majority of
clients are protected from this, immunized from it. So I don't really think reputationally
there's been any hit on us apart from the odd one or two liners on these wires. So Andy,
do you want to take the -

Yes. We actually provide some sensitivities on Page 37, if you want to look at them later.
So we do three. One is a 10% reduction in funds under management, which I've covered
there. The other was a 10% increase in the lapse assumption. And again, there the ratio
goes up. So the current ratio is 151%; 10% reduction in funds under management, the ratio
is 153%; a 10% increase in lapse assumption, the ratio is 156%; and a 10% increase in
renewal expenses, the ratio goes down to 149%. Now, in each of those three scenarios,
the net asset number of £722.4 million doesn't move.

Okay. I'm going to take one more, Andy. You've had a – I'm going to take David and then
we'll – really nice, positive question there to end proceedings on, so no pressure on you.

Well, I'll do my best. David McCann from Numis. Another one on the dividend, I'm afraid.
You talked in the guidance that we should look to the underlying growth of the business.
Now, given some of the cost pressures you've talked about and given that obviously
markets have started in a difficult way this year, obviously a bit of pressure on the cash
earnings number anyway this year, compared to what it might have been. So, looking at
that number, should we be more looking at, say, the organic growth of the funds or just
the funds under management growth, or is the cash earnings still the best proxy for the
dividend growth we should look for? Thanks.

A - Andrew Martin Crof t

{BIO 5711239 <GO>}

I mean we talk about the operating performance of the business, so there is the organic
growth in new business. Underlying cash is an important point in there. But let's just do a
scenario for a moment. New business is up 15%, but because of markets are difficult
underlying cash is only up 3%, then we would have regard to the 15% performance in the
business.

Okay. That's clear. Thank you.

Okay, let's wrap it there. Andy will pick up any other points outside, because the guys will
stay around for coffee. We've got Roger Yates, Simon Jeffreys, Sarah Bates from the
Board here as well. So I'm sure they'll be very happy to take any questions, particularly on
Solvency II, because they've swotted up on it really well over the last two or three weeks.
