FINAL

And regarding the new set of information, we hope it will be extremely helpful for you.
This is a new set of documents and this is well-framed in the new increase of
transparency, the transparency plan implemented by the Chairman, and also to increase
our communication with stakeholders.
Let me take you through the highlights for the first quarter. During this period, we have
seen an increase of over 9% in premiums due to an impressive 34% rise in the Life
business and nearly 4% growth in Non-Life premiums.
Revenue shows a similar trend with 9% growth. We saw positive developments in the
majority of the regions and business units, with outstanding performance of MAPFRE
three largest operations as well as MAPFRE.
I would like to point out the excellent performance of the Life business in Spain thanks to
the successful launch of new products and sales promotions, especially in RED MAPFRE,
our agent channel. We have also seen a pickup in production in Non-Life, which is
noteworthy when considering the ongoing process of canceling non-profitable portfolios.

Bloomberg Transcript

Currency conversion have also had a positive impact on top-line figures thanks to the
appreciation of the U.S. dollars and the Brazilian real. Finally, there was a slight fall in
financial income, but is still proving quite resilient given the low interest rate environment
in Europe.
Let's move to the next page. Regarding the combined ratio, it stood at 97.5% at the close
of the first quarter. Expense ratio improved by 70 basis points to 26.7%, thanks to strict
cost containment policies. And the claims ratio stood at 70.8% at the close of March.
These reflect improvements in the loss ratio that have been taking place in several
markets, including; first, motor lines in Spain and Turkey; second, general P&C lines in
Brazil; and finally, homeowner insurance in the United States. On the other hand, adverse
weather condition in Southern Spain, heavy rain and winds and in Peru the coastal Niño
phenomenon also impacted our operations.
We estimate both events costs are 1.2 p.p. loss ratio increase. Those are relevant, but
there were also several large industrial claims at MAPFRE Global Risk. The net result down
the page grew by 7.5% reaching €206 million with an ROE of slightly over 9%. This reflects
higher profit in the Life business in Brazil and Spain, in part affected by the reversal of
some provisions in the bank as well as business. Finally, Non-Life results continued to be
quite solid in key regions.
Please turn to slide 6. Looking at shareholders' equity, we can see that it has been quite
stable in the period on the back of lower market volatility and currency movement, with a
slight decrease of €74 million, mainly due to the deduction of the final dividend to be paid
this June and approved at the recent AGM.

FINAL

Assets under management have grown by almost 3% year-to-date, supported by, first,
the Life business acquired by BANKINTER VIDA in Portugal; second, a positive evolution of
the mutual and pension fund businesses with over 6% growth, framing in MAPFRE's
strategy to grow in AM, asset management; third the rally in equity markets during the
period; and finally, the appreciation of the Brazilian real 2.5% more or less.
Let's turn to slide number 7. I would like to point out MAPFRE's dividend policy, very well
known by you, which is focused on creating shareholder value, with net results as the main
driver for growing dividends. As you already know, our final dividend of €0.085 was
approved at the AGM, taking the total dividend proposed against 2016 results to €0.0145
per share. Finally, the final dividend will be paid on June 20.
Let's turn to next page. And on this slide, we can see the overall distribution of our
business by regional area. Just as a reminder, regional areas include business for an
insurance unit as well as the business from MAPFRE Global Risk and MAPFRE ASISTENCIA,
corresponding to each region. Assistance business comes mainly from EMEA and North
America, while LatAm and Iberia are the most significant regions for Global Risk. As you
can see, MAPFRE continues benefiting from a very well diversified business profile and
with a good balance between mature and emerging countries.

Bloomberg Transcript

The following slide we'll take a closer look at the results by business units and also by
region. As you can see in the chart of the left, the insurance unit represent over 17% of the
MAPFRE's business, another 16% approximately comes from MAPFRE RE and the
remainder is split between Global Risk and Assistance.
Focusing on our territorial areas and business units, I would like to point out the following.
First, the Iberia accounts for over 32% of the total premiums as a result of the continued
pickup in production in main lines of businesses. Second, LatAm accounts for 27% of total
premiums, which have grown by over 18% thanks to the Brazilian local currency growth in
Brazil, and also the appreciation of the real.
And national with around 17% of premiums is growing thanks to a positive development in
Massachusetts, our core market in the United States, and also with an additional push
from the appreciation of the dollar.
Next, MAPFRE RE represents around 16% of the total premiums and continues growing
and nearly 7%. Performance of the non-group business remains quite stable.
And finally, Global Risk is also growing at steady rates and MAPFRE ASISTENCIA has seen
a fall in premiums due to, you know very well as well, the current assorting (9:47) in
process that we're carrying out in this unit.
Let's turn to the next slide to look at the main movements in attributable results. It is
worth pointing out the notable improvement in profit in Iberia where the positive
developments in motor together with the reversal provision for contingent payments in
the bancassurance channel. Both contributed to offset the bad weather conditions in
Southern Spain during the quarter, mainly January and February.

FINAL

In international, the improvement in the net result is due to the outstanding performance
in Turkey, business are doing very well there, and to a lesser extent an improvement in
the United States.
And third, Global Risk experienced a fall in profit during the year as a result of several
large industrial claims and some concentration of (10:46) claims. This was a oil refinery in
Abu Dhabi and also other significant losses in EMEA. MAPFRE ASISTENCIA continues with
business restructuring and losses are mainly coming from operations in the U.K.
Please now turn to slide 11 when José Manuel Inchausti, CEO of Iberia, will present the
information for the business unit he runs.

José Manuel Inchausti
Thank you, Fernando, and good morning everybody. It's a pleasure to be here today with
you.

Bloomberg Transcript

Going to my first slide, we are in page 11. I have to say that MAPFRE Iberia result in the first
quarter has grown by 27%. This extraordinary growth reflects an important improvement,
primarily as a result of the cancelation of a reserve for contingent payments in the
bancassurance channel totaling €27 million after taxes.
We have had an increase in loss ratio going for weather-related events in the property
lines that were compensated by the positive development of the combined ratio in other
lines, especially motor.
The company, MAPFRE Iberia, MAPFRE Spain is implementing transformation process
based in a number of initiatives. I would like to highlight a better customer value
proposition focused on what we call the platinum customer, including free phone line for
this type of customers, personalized services and preferred renewal conditions.
We are in the process of implementation a new broker segmentation with their
corresponding value proposition. We have divided, splitted our brokers depending on
criteria regarding size, relationship with MAPFRE and, of course, profitability.
We are starting a very deep digitalization of our claim processes. We have called e-claim
these number of projects within these big objectives; modification on the reimbursement
processes for medical and pharmaceutical services; enable online appointments in the
customer area in MAPFRE clinics and also in our app; implementation of claims monitoring,
et cetera.
We are launching new mobilized solutions for pricing policy writing, especially in motor,
homeowners and health, and we are having succeed in these developments.
Regarding the – going to the next slide – sorry, going to the next part of the life insurance
premiums. We have to say that we have a good growth of about 46%. MAPFRE growth in

FINAL

the Spain is about 8 points above the average market growth, with a special emphasis on
growth in savings, both in MAPFRE network that has climbed to 52% and also in Portugal,
in which we are collecting very good results.
As I have said, weather-related events going to the combined ratio analyzed. Weatherrelated events in the first quarter have had a very important impact – significant impact on
the combined ratio. We have about 60,000 claims out of the business as usual, with a
total cost of €16 million, which implies 4 points in the general insurance business
combined ratio.
In the next slide, page number 12, you will find more in-depth analyze on the Spanish
motor business. Our premium growth in retail, speaking about retail, grew by 1.7%. This is
impact by the cancelation of our basic product that is not longer being sold as a result of
its high loss ratio.
MAPFRE growth is based on profitability. So, you can see by the average premium growth,
which is from 2015, constantly up than the market average. Continuing with this strategy
for profitable growth, MAPFRE Spain has implemented a series of measures to control
and to reduce claims and expenses.

Bloomberg Transcript

All of these measures altogether has going to drop 2 points our combined ratio, which is
2 points below the market. At the close of the first quarter of 2017, we have this motor
insurance combined ratio improved by 2.7 points compared to March 2016. So now we
have the combined ratio in 91.5%, which is a very good number for us.
We have reduced cost in property damage about 6.5% and we are still reviewing our nonprofitable business, mainly fleets, professional third-party liability and group accident in
our project that we call internally Project 80/20. We are working on that since 2015.
We are in a process, as I have said, of digitalization of some of our main claim processes.
And this is giving us an improvement on the cost ratio associated with these processes.
Finally, as I have said, we have a better and improving 2.1 points below the market.
Regarding my last slide, we are in page 15 now. Talking a little bit about Baremo
implementation, we have to update our prices in 2015. And also we considered a
sufficient reserve, a solid reserve for the new criterias about in an order of €35 million. A
little over a year has passed since the new Baremo came into force and we have some
conclusions. We think that the majority of the cost increases happened in 2016. We
registered about 12.5%. So we think that in 2017 it can still continue to rise but in a lesser
extent. In the first quarter, we measured about 1.6%.
We carried out rate increases in previous years. And I think we have increased our rates in
2015 and 2016 enough. We believe that the Baremo should not impact our rate increases
anymore or not in a significant way.

There are no changes in our reserve. We are make revision of that reserve on a quarterly
basis and didn't think that we should need any further development on that reserves. And
the reserves established for IBNR and for worst case claims were calculated and updated
with the latest information available and always with a criteria of prudence required by
MAPFRE.

FINAL

Thank you. That is all the formation regarding Iberia.
And now I give the floor back to Fernando Mata. Thank you very much.

Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks, José Manuel. Very interesting. On page 15, I would like to take a closer look
at the main drivers of the net result, the changes compared to the previous year and also
non-recurring items, extraordinary items.

Bloomberg Transcript

The chart on the top shows variation for the net result for both periods €192 million and
€206 million net result for each period. First, I will explain the change in Non-Life. There
was a €4 million increase in the underlying Non-Life technical results, thanks to
improvements in technical management and the already mentioned cost containment
initiatives.
Second column, the €5 million reduction in the financial results is in line with the low
interest rate environment in Europe. And finally, for Non-Life, there was a €27 million
decrease mainly due to the coastal Niño phenomenon. There is a full disclosure of all the
extraordinary events at the bottom of the page.
I would like to point out a typo at the bottom of the page. Life extraordinary impacts 2016.
There is a typo. The current year is 2017.
Second, let's move to Life. Life business profit increased by €55 million due to
improvements across the board, Iberia and Brazil being the most relevant. Additionally,
there was a reversal of provisions to the bancassurance channel in Spain totaling €29
million.
Third, taxes had decreased as a result of different business mix. Spain is the largest
contributor and also the country with one of the lowest tax rate. And now reduction of
taxes paid in Brazil, in that case is due to the agricultural business which has tax reliefs.
And lastly, the increasing non-controlling interest is due to the increase in Life profit in
Brazil, largely driven by the currency appreciation in Spain.
On the next page, we'll see the information about Non-life premiums. Non-life premiums
have grown by 3.8%, again driven by growth in our main markets. In Brazil, we've seen
solid local currency growth, especially in Industrial Risk and agro business lines, as well as
the impact of the appreciation of the Brazilian real. Second, the health line in Spain is
performing very well and keeping the same trend from last year's.

FINAL

And third, in the United States, we've seen growth in motor premiums in Massachusetts,
mainly supported by tariff rises. Global Risk is mainly growing in Iberia, Brazil and LatAm
North. And finally, MAPFRE RE also continues growing at a healthy rate as a result of the
positive evolution of the Non-Group business.
Please turn to the next slide, page 17. We'll take a look at the combined ratio. First, strict
cost containment strategies continued showing results, especially in Iberia, LatAm North
and EMEA.
There was a positive claims experience in our main markets during the quarter. First, in the
Spanish motor, we are seeing lower frequency and a positive evolution of VERTI's
business. Agricultural and Multiperil lines in Brazil have been positively impacted by mild
weather.
Third, the homeowner insurance in the United States, mainly in Massachusetts, also
affected MAPFRE RE because of the quota share reinsurance treaty. Tariff increases and
underwriting improvements introduced in 2016 in motor in Turkey. And finally, MAPFRE RE,
which is benefiting from a reduction in the expense ratio. In that case, due to a lower
trading (24:11) commission that offset some increases in the loss ratio.

Bloomberg Transcript

As I already explained, the increase in the claims ratio is due to adverse weather
conditions in Southern Spain and the effects of the coastal Niño in Peru. And second,
several large industrial claims at MAPFRE Global Risks. And last, higher claims in motor in
Brazil and Mexico is the same trend that we already discussed in last year.
On page 18, as you can see in the chart, the financial result on Non-Life fell by around €23
million compared to March of the previous year and this fall reflects the following; first,
low interest rate environment; second, we also seen a fall in financial income in Brazil due
to lower interest rate and inflation, which was partially mitigated by depreciation of the
real; third, there were also lower foreign exchange differences. It was minus €10 million
compared to the previous year, which were positive in 2016 and slightly negative in 2017.
And finally, higher realized gains and we took advantage of the rally in equities in the first
quarter of the year, mainly in Spain. Gains reached around €31 million, compared to €21
million the previous year. The largest increase as I mentioned took place in MAPFRE RE
and Iberia.
Slight 19 shows the premiums and result of the Life business. In Iberia, premiums grew by
almost 46%, thanks to successful launch of new savings products and sales campaigns in
Iberia, especially unit-linked products.
Once again, RED MAPFRE proves to be a very valuable distribution channel for MAPFRE.
We are also seeing resilient local currency growth in Brazil, nearly 1%, despite the
complicated economic counters that are living (26:32) in the country.

FINAL

And also we have seen some improvements in margins in the products sold through the
bancassurance channel as well as the positive impact from the appreciation of the
Brazilian real.
It's important to mention as well the bancassurance channel in Malta that continues
performing well. And MAPFRE RE continues showing strong growth as well and
profitability, in part due to higher realized gains. We're also seeing higher realized gains in
Iberia as well as the already commented €29 million impact from bancassurance
contingent payments.
Turn to next slide please. This slide shows the evolution of our capital base. On the left,
you can see the shareholders' equity amounted to over €9 billion at the end of 2016. And
market volatility affected our financial assets. It was offset by shadow accounting and
currency movements were reduced as well.
In summary, the reduction is due to the dividend distribution approved by the AGM to be
paid in June. Since revaluation, unrealized gains are practically fully offset net of shadow
accounting as fully offset by currency conversion differences.

Bloomberg Transcript

On page 21, we will take a look at the investment portfolio. In the first quarter of the year,
the investment strategy has continued to be marked by a low interest rate environment in
mainly Europe, despite the fact that the increase of political risk in some countries caused
the pickups in interest rates for peripheral debt, mainly Spanish debt affecting the
MAPFRE.
In this context, a greater economical growth and improved expectations for company
profits, investment in fixed income has been reduced, quite limited, little-by-little and
position have been taken in equities, and to a lesser extent, on the alternative assets,
mainly (28:46) and the right positions in real estate.
Therefore exposure to national and corporate debt in the investment portfolio has gone
from 57.2% and 20.2% to 54.8% and 19.2% of the portfolios respectively.
Now turn to page 22, please. Here we'll take a moment to analyze our capital structure
and debt position. On the left side, you can see the composition of the capital structure
as of March 2017 amounts to over €14 billion, and the largest of which is equity with 80%
percent of the total. 20% is our leverage.
On the right side, you can see that leverage is low compared to peers, 20%, as I
mentioned, increased during the quarter due to the issuance of the €600 million
subordinated debt in March, with a fixed interest rate set at 4.375% for the first 10 years
and a call option at 10 years. Finally, interest coverage also compared favorable to peers,
23 times earnings before interest and tax.
On the next few slides, we'll take a closer look at our Solvency II information, which is
referred to December 31, 2016.
Page 8 of 21



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2017-04-28

FINAL

On page 23, Solvency II figures confirm MAPFRE's strong solvency position. The 210%
Solvency II ratio is based on a high-quality capital structure of more than €9.6 billion and
eligible own funds of which 94% is under CT Tier 1 capital, the remaining 6% is through
ordinary debt. As you can see, our solvency margin has been quite stable throughput the
year despite certain market volatility.
Please turn to next slide. Here we can take a look at the capital generated on the
Solvency II during 2016. the MAPFRE Group had a solvency margin of €4.2 billion at the end
of 2015, which increased by over €800 million to €5 billion at the end of 2016.
Main drivers of this improvement were as follows: first, a €578 million increase in IFRS
equity, excluding retained earnings. It means that these movements are mainly due to the
growth in unrealized gains of the available-for-sale portfolio as well as positive currency
conversion differences. So let's say that those are non-organic growth and they're mainly
caused by market conditions.
Second, €457 million increase in IFRS retained earnings, thus organic growth. And finally, a
change in the solvency capital requirement, mainly in market risk, driven by larger
sponsors to equities and an increasing value of other assets.

Bloomberg Transcript

In conclusion, we're pretty happy. Change is driven by the central formula we're not
relevant (32:14) and mainly organic.
In the three following pages you have more detailed information regarding Solvency II,
which show limited changes in trends and also sensitivity analysis, but very, very few
changes compared to previous years.
That's all for me. And thank you for your attention. And now Natalia will begin with, if there
is nothing to say, with the Q&A session.

Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Thank you. Fernando, and thank you, José Manuel. Thank you everyone for your attention
too. We will now move to the Q&A session. Fernando Mata, José Manuel Inchausti and
myself will be answering the questions you already sent.
And just as a reminder if you, if there are any questions we didn't have time to answer,
the Investor Relations team will get back to you as soon as possible. So we can start with
the Q&A session.

Q&A
A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

The first question is with regards to Iberia's operations. These questions are from Niccolo
Dalla Palma from Exane BNP, Andrew Sinclair from Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Paz

FINAL

How do you explain the degree of improvement in the combined ratio for Spanish motor?
You explained Baremo has increased average claims by 12% in 2006 and 2% so far this
year. But we can't see any of the impacts in your numbers?

A - José Manuel Inchausti
Thank you very much. It is true that finally over the increase in the Baremo, we didn't took
it to add an effect in our combined ratio. And this is because we have worked on other
aspect of our combined ratio in motor insurance, especially in the profitable growth
strategy. We are working on the 80/20 project. In fact, our fleet businesses we took about
20 points down in our combined ratio going from the fleet businesses. We improved cost
in claims with property damage. And finally, we are working on digitalization of our
processes and that makes our internal expense ratio comes down.

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

The next question is about the top-line Spanish motor. How much fleet business do you
still have in the books? How worried are you about your loss of market share that
continues in the retail motor business?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - José Manuel Inchausti
We maintain nowadays less than 10% of our book in the fleet businesses. Our objective is
to maintain only the profitable fleet businesses. In fact, we are trying to bring in new fleets
but with a smaller size, typically less than 100 cars per fleet. Unfortunately market data do
not separate growth in fleet. But we estimate – our best estimation is that the difference
that we have with the market growth in the retail business is 1 point or less.
We will start a series of measures aimed at customer with high return on our low
combined ratio starting in the 1 of May. We have completely designed all of these
measures and we will come to enforce immediately. So we think we will take good results
from that measures.

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

The next question is about Spain. The expense ratio improved visibly. Was this something
exceptional or do you expect to maintain this rate of improvement throughout 2017?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you. This is Fernando. First of all, I would like to point out that one year is
perhaps I mean is enough experience just for the 2016 accident year. But there is still
things to come. But so far and after the first quarter, the development of the 2016
accident year, I mean, is quite neutral. So, as far as we know and according to the
information available, we believe that the majority of the 2016 cost related to Baremo
we'll book in 2016 accounts. And so our perspective for 2016 is very positive.

Page 10 of 21

FINAL

As we disclose and we took a sample of significant claims and we monitor the
developments of those claims in 2017 the first quarter and we saw is negative loss
development of between 5%, 6%, 6% or less. We consider it quite reasonable, and was
covered by the increasing IBNR that we did last year.
So, in summary, I mean the rate increase in 2016 and also the proper appropriation of
reserves, both case-by-case and also IBNR, and also the special Baremo reserve, we can
conclude that they're enough in order to cover any potential deviation in the future, which
at that point we consider won't be in any case material, a significant from up (38:38).

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Fernando. Now discussion I think was more focused on expense
ratio and improvement. So Mr. Inchausti will answer about this improvement.

A - José Manuel Inchausti
Okay. I will add some specific information about the expense ratio. We do not consider
exceptional the improvement on the expense ratio during the first quarter. We are
working very hard on the internal and external expenses. And we have slightly decreasing
in our internal expenses compared to an increase in our premium income.

Bloomberg Transcript

So we are constantly looking for this ratio have positive figure and we are working in many
fields. And we do not consider extraordinary the results of the first quarter. So we think
that more or less we will have good expense ratio during the year.

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Thank you.

A - José Manuel Inchausti
Next, please.

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

The next question. You mentioned the exceptional weather losses in Iberia. Can you
quantify how much of these claims was exceptional versus your normal budget?

A - José Manuel Inchausti
Yes. We have mentioned on page 11 on my presentation. We had 57,000 claims for a total
of €16 million, which only implies 4 points of Iberia general insurance combined ratio.

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Next question is regarding health insurance. Can you explain the worsening combined
ratio? Are you carrying out any restructuration in this business?

A - José Manuel Inchausti
Page 11 of 21



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2017-04-28

FINAL

Okay. The first thing to say is that that typically combined ratio in health insurance is higher
during the first quarter and then comes down in the next quarter. The second thing is that
we have had slightly increase of claims going from group contracts and we are working on
it. And we have taken some measures in the 2017 premium renewal.
And the third thing I would like to say is we have reorganized our internal expenses based
on our a sophisticated model. And these has result having the same expenses to share
with other branches that that new reorganization have resulted in an increase of internal
expenses linked with the health insurance businesses. So, generally speaking, we are not
worried about this increase on the figure based on these reasons.

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

And the last question regarding Iberia is about Life results. Can you explain the reversion
of the contingency payment in the specific bancassurance agreements?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. And unfortunately we cannot, I mean, disclose the joint venture and I will explain later
what the reason. I mean, we have in our liability side of the balance sheet different
contingent payments. Regarding bancassurance channels, they're pretty common in the
bancassurance channel in Spain. Some of them, there are additional commissions that's
been paid, regarding some long-term goals.
I know there are some announced to be paid and they're coming from some acquisitions.
In that case, I mean this €29 million is a reversal of 100 (42:40). But we don't disclose our
partner involved, I'm afraid. And we do not speak about the long-term goals, business

Thank you very much. This next set of questions is with regards to the evolution of
business at MAPFRE USA. Niccolo Dalla Palma from Exane BNP Paribas would like to know,
can you update on your U.S. strategy, which areas are you growing and which ones are
you exiting?
Also Ivan Bokhmat from Barclays asks the following. The combined ratio outside
Massachusetts remains very high. How much of that is extraordinary loss experience and
how much is management actions to take market share?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you. I mean we are growing around 10% in Massachusetts with positive trends
in both motor and homeowners. And basically the results, you say, the tariff increases in
motor are quite recent and in homeowners due to the 2015 snowfall.
Going forward, growth will be focused on motor lines and there are several states that we
consider core and this topic was very well explained by our Chairman at the AGM in March.

FINAL

Those are Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, California and Florida. I am
not sure if I'm missing one, but this is the core of the states.
And as we already mentioned before, expansion as a cost and we have had to pay annual
business premium. We've been actively monitoring our business in non-core states and
will gradually begin to stop underwriting the business in some of them. And for now, we're
stopping, I mean, the marketing and sales promotions on those states we do not
consider to be core business.

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Thank you very much. This next set of questions is regarding the evolution of the MAPFRE
ASISTENCIA. Niccolo Dalla Palma from Exane BNP Paribas asks: ASISTENCIA had again
some unfavorable development. What is driving this? Has growth been too aggressive in
recent years?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. There is some question regarding Assistance, and I'd like to elaborate a little bit
more about this. And also Michael Huttner already mentioned that last year. We expected
2017 to be break-even more or less. And frankly, I mean, we expected a better result in
Assistance, and not that good in Spain that we had. Unfortunately, I mean, good things
have bad news. I mean, they are being compensated in MAPFRE and this is the good
thing of having a proper diversification of business.
In 2016, we had a bad experience in travel assistance in France, if you remember. We
expected more or less a neutral result in the business coming from the UK. But both, I
mean, negative development of the run-off of some multi-year policies in the UK and also
the Brexit. I mean, different of currency comparisons, we saw multi-year policies in sterling
pounds and now we're paying claims in euros and dollar, both I mean degrading (46:26)
our loss ratio and combined ratio in ASISTENCIA.
I mean it's difficult to forecast what is going to happen, I mean, in the rest of the year. I
mean, we are working hard in order to fix this operation, ASISTENCIA, mainly in the UK.
We're trying to reduce losses but at that point we consider it quite challenges, I mean, to
break-even in Assistance business in 2017.

Thank you. The following question refers to the MAPFRE Global Risks business. Niccolo
Dalla Palma from Exane BNP Paribas asks what is your reinsurance strategy in Global Risks?
Hi, Niccolo. Okay. The MAPFRE Global Risk reinsurance strategy is consistent over time.
This is the main highlight about that. During the last year, we have maintained exactly the
same protection MAPFRE Global Risks. That mainly is due to – MAPFRE Global Risk
protects mainly through non-proportional reinsurance. So net claims have aligned with the
financial capacity of this unit.

FINAL

Given the volatility of this business, sometimes certain accumulation sits and is what has
happened during the first quarter of this year. This is reflected in the results. But these
doesn't in turn at all risk or threat in the short-term from this business unit.
Thank you very much. Paz Ojeda at JB Capital Markets and Ivan Bokhmat from Barclays
ask the following. Global Risks has experienced a very strong performance last year; close
to 0% contribution this first quarter. What is the reason for this deterioration? What is the
normalized combined ratio for the business and why is it so high right now?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

I think past deterioration in MAPFRE Global Risk combined ratio is due to the increasing
large claims, especially in EMEA and LatAm, so which are resulting in higher loss rate.

Bloomberg Transcript

I will like to elaborate a little bit longer regarding Niño phenomenon, because from
outside you could expect a larger loss in MAPFRE and a smaller in Global Risks. But due to
– let's say that it was by chance, but anyway, but the rains affected the power station in
Peru that that was covered by Global Risk. So the main effect from the Niño phenomenon
is affecting Global Risk. Also it was a blast in oil refinery in Abu Dhabi. We both consider
them as an extraordinary event.
And regarding the underlying loss ratio or the combined ratio, currently is well above
100% and we expect to have it lower than 100%, I mean, as we've reported from
previous year. We'll keep in the same as truth as the underlying guidelines of those
business. But some of those claims sometimes happen and unfortunately it was
concentrated in our claims during the first quarter.

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Thank you very much. This next block of questions is concerning the development in Brazil
and Mexico. They're sent by Niccolo Dalla Palma from Exane BNP, Andrew Sinclair from
Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Regarding Brazil, in motor your combined ratio keeps
creeping up. The same is true in Mexico where you refer to problems in multi-year group
policies. What is the outlook?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Well, the outlook for those countries is following: Brazil to focus on profitable growth and
better economic (50:47) that will allow reduction in combined ratio. As we already
mentioned, we're reducing our fleet, there is like a 9% reduction, I'm not sure, we have to
confirm this figure with Natalia. But there is a reduction of units in both significant relevant
in Brazil and Mexico in order to limit our exposure in this market.
And regarding Mexico, the companies canceling unprofitable contracts. There were some
of the multi-year contracts and it is too early as well to give a proper guidance, but we'll
see the effect of this strategy probably at the end of this year, and that's all. Reduction of
exposure, increase of tariffs and cancelation of non-profitable portfolios. I mean, thus the
same receipt that we have in both countries.

Thank you. Why did the Life protection result in Brazil not grow as fast as the top-line?.

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

FINAL

Well, this is due to high level of claims in first quarter 2017 together with lower amount of
financial income quarter (51:59).

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Thank you. Can you provide any more detail on the SUSEP and rate reductions in Brazil
and what we can expect for the rest of the year?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, I will cover this topic and also with Turkey as well. We've seen some interventions of
the governments in the free market and also the transparency of tariffs in Brazil and
Turkey. SUSEP in case of Brazil has implemented a 50% reduction in the tariff, say, for
third-party liability across the board. I mean the different percent is according to the race
and also the regions. But it's important to take into account that this cover has a quite low
weight in MAPFRE Brazil portfolio. We have to confirm this number as well, but I don t think
the compulsory insurance in Brazil being larger than 15% of the total order portfolio.
Regarding Turkey, and I will cover this topic as well, it has a full disclosure on our
management discussion and analysis. (53:03) recently was approved by the government,
reduction as well average 50% across the board. In that case, affecting compulsory
insurance and in that case our portfolio has a larger portion of the total fleet.
And it should be like 60%, I am not sure how to confirm. Yeah, Natalia is saying like a 60%
more or less. And in that case what we are doing, we're expecting something like this and
that will reduce in our fleet and also increase in tariffs. I mean, it probably will have an
impact on the short-term. But due to a reduction in fleet and increase of tariffs in other
coverage, we believe we could compensate the increase in loss ratio with improvements
in combined ratio and other line of business.

Thank you. Regarding severe claims and industrial risk in Brazil, can you please quantify

we'll have it included in our public information and any quantification on this effect.

FINAL

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Thank you. And the final question regarding Brazil, does the first quarter's financial income
provide a good run rate for the rest of the year?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Well, financial income in Brazil is linked to the evolution of sleek (54:54) rate. And so the
inflation is reduced, it's reasonable to expect a further reduction as well in sleek (54:59).
And this will have an impact on our financial income.

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

If I may say something, this evolution is mainly because the investments there are floating
and are linked to inflation on interest rates. That's why we are seeing perhaps a slight
decrease in the financial income coming from Brazil. So, according to the reduction of the
sleek (55:35), we could be or could continue be affecting of this reduction.

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you very much. We have also received several questions regarding the December
2016 Solvency II figures that were released.
Regarding capital generation, Andrew Sinclair from Bank of America Merrill Lynch asks the
following: Thank you for the new disclosure today. Can you confirm how many points of
capital you think that MAPFRE organically generates each year? It isn't clear to me from
slide 24 how much is organic generation versus how much is due to market moves? Also
can you please confirm how much of the capital generated is cash?
And in the same line, Niccolo Dalla Palma from Exane BNP Paribas would like to know: Can
you give us your read of the Solvency II movement in quarter one? How much was
underlying, how much market movement, and then dividend accrual?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yes. Regarding this three question, on slide 24, and also in the management discussion
and analysis there's a full disclosure, you can see the breakdown of the over €800 million
increasing our solvency margin.
As we mentioned during the presentation, a large part of this improvement is due to
higher IFRS equity on the back of growth in unrealized gains of the available-for-sale
portfolio as well as positive currency conversion differences. And this is let's say the
capital generation from outside. And there was also a positive contribution from IFRS
retained earnings that we consider has been organic.

FINAL

We have not provided a disclosure of cash flow generation. For the time being, there is no
clear standard criteria on the Solvency II for reporting this concept. I mean, my view is like
regarding Solvency II, it's difficult to see your cash generation since you have to – I mean,
to change the sector, the part of financial instruments that there much will occur in
technical provisions. So, in the end, it's just the free or let's say your financial instruments
linked to equity and also your cash linked with equity as well.
And anyway you need assistance going through the breakdown of these numbers, which
are fully disclosed and as I said in the presentation and also the management discussion
and analysis. Natalia and rest of her team will be available after this call to assist you.

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Farquhar Murray from Autonomous also submitted several
questions regarding Solvency II. Could you just please explain and ideally decompose the
€989 million increase in Solvency II capital quarter-on-quarter between third quarter 2016
and full-year 2016? What precisely drove this material increase in the quarter and how do
we tally it to the previously disclosed sensitivities?
Why do the Solvency II sensitivities look to have changed markedly between full-year 2015
and full-year 2016? In particular, the sensitivities to interest rates and corporate bond
spreads seem to be notably different. What precisely drove that?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yes. Regarding sensitivities, the reduction in the year is due to smaller duration gap which
has led to smaller duration between market moves of assets and liabilities. As we have
mentioned before, MAPFRE at here say to very conservative ALM strategy with cash flow
margin and duration administration strategies, applying a large share of a large portfolio
mainly in Spain, which claim in sensitivity to changes in rates.
And also the change between September and December figures mainly due to
movements in the BEL, the best estimate of liability as a result of the application of more
consolidated criteria to liabilities on the IFRS which reduce the adjustment necessary on
the Solvency II. Again, if you need any help going through, I mean this specific numbers,
the IR team will be available after the call.

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

It's still important to highlight regarding the sensitivity to what spreads last year, the
sensitivity to corporate sovereign were together and this year we have to separate them.
That's why you can see a slight difference. But if you compare both presentations, last
year's and this one, you could see that the main impact is in the spreads in making
sovereign splits mainly, because the corporate spreads are lower. But you need any
further explanation, we will be available for you later on.
Thank you very much. We've also received one additional question from Michael Huttner.
What is the sensitivity to sovereign spreads for Solvency II?

would like just to mention was just the last thing that – I'm sorry, there are two more
questions coming up. Yeah. We'll try to answer. Yes, please.

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Sorry. They arrived just now. Sorry, Fernando.

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yeah. We have 10 minutes, yes, for both questions. Yeah.

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Sorry about the confusion. Thank you. Michael Huttner from JPMorgan has also asked the
following question. At the Annual General Meeting, you reduced the target ROE from
previously 11% on average 2016 to 2018 to now 11% just 2018. Can you say why the
change? And given you are still at 9% first quarter 2017, how confident are you of getting
to that 11% next year? Where is the improvement to come from?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you, Michael. And if I may partially correct you. I mean, the Chairman at the
AGM didn't change the main strategies for the three-year period. And that the goal so is
still there. But he also mentioned that the average 11% ROE was pretty challenging, but he
has specifically mentioned that we will achieve 11% ROE on 2018.
Let me elaborate a little bit more about this. And we're still seeing a quite strong capital
base in MAPRE. We are pretty happy, I mean, with this situation. I mean, our capital is
pretty good and also our solvency margin are improving. So how it's deteriorating our

Page 18 of 21



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2017-04-28

ROE? We believe that this trend will change when the interest rates will rise and also
perhaps there's some currency conversion differences.

FINAL

We have to improve our net result. Basically, the delta will be coming from the fixing of
those operations, such as Assistance or we have to improve as well our net result in Italy.
And we believe with this improvement in net result the ROE will improve much more for
sure.

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Thank you. Ivan Bokhmat from Barclays has the following question: The reinsurance
combined ratio remains low despite a moderately active cat in the quarter, particularly in
LatAm? Were there any reserve releases of note?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

No, there is no reserve releases. As I already mentioned, Niño phenomenon affected
mainly Global Risk, and less extent MAPFRE RE. On the other hand, other cat situation has
been reported during the first quarter. And also MAPFRE RE is benefiting from the
homeowners quota share from the U.S. And that's all.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Thank you. Michael Ballitore (1:04:53) from KBW has sent in a question regarding financial
income. If his calculations are right, the pure investment income in P&C, including realized
gains and FX, decreased by 30% year-on-year. What did drive this negative
development? The fall in P&C financial income was €23 million, around 12%. This is very
much in line with the underlying, if you exclude...

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Well, first, let's say – let's answer there. The pure investment income in P&C is reducing
because the low interest in Europe. And there are more – I mean, the way we invested
the new cash flow and also maturities, I mean, casing in (1:05:40) at lower interest deal. I
didn't catch the other question. Sorry.

A - Natalia Núñez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

The question is what drove this negative development?
I think it's the right answer. We have talked about the low interest rate environment and
this is the main reason, also the forex movements but that compensate the other. And as
we have mentioned before in other years, the financial income coming from Brazil was
quite notable. And also the slight fall this year is also reflected in our Non-Life financial
income account. But this decrease in the interest rate is also compensated for the good
development of currency rates. This is the main reason here.
And the last question that we have today is from Niccolo Dalla Palma from Exane BNP. And
he asks regarding Spanish Life, will you be able to take over the business of BMN

Page 19 of 21



Company N ame: M apfre SA

following the Bankia-BMN merger?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah. Thank you, Niccolo. As we already said, we're quite happy with the current
relationship with Bankia and also the bancassurance channel, I mean it's key for MAPFRE
and we would like to expand our business in this channel.
Regarding your question, will we be able to take over the business? The thing is, there is
a contest between the two financial entities and the process is going ahead and once the
process is finished and we will sit with Bankia in order to see any potential development
of expanding our current agreement with Bankia to outlets coming from the potential
future bank merger. But that's all.
And I guess there is no any further questions. So we are finishing and I would like just to
point out just a summary and wrap-up. We're pretty happy with the results and also the
growth in business. So, summary, I mean, Iberia is performing extraordinarily well and
allow us to mitigate to offset some small losses coming from small units, basically
Assistance, and also some direct operations in EMEA, mainly in Italy.

Bloomberg Transcript

There is just a couple of countries with small losses; Mexico, which the losses are coming
mainly from currency conversions. We have an excess of financial investment
denominated in dollar and due to the increase of the value of the peso, we booked some
differences. And also a small loss in Chile due to the wildfires during the first quarter, but
we think that we will come back to profits in the rest of the year.
So, as a conclusion, we're quite happy and we're still working on those small units in order
to have them fixed as soon as possible. Thank you for your presence and any further
questions or for additional information you may require, Natalia is ready to answer any
question. Thank you and bye-bye.
