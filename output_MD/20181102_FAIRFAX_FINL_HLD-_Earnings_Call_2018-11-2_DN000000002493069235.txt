Derek Bulas
Good morning and welcome to our call to discuss Fairfax's 2018 third quarter results. This
call may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ perhaps materially
from those contained in such forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of

FINAL

Thank you, Derek. Good morning, Fairfax shareholders. Welcome to your company's third
quarter conference call. I plan to give you some of the highlights and then pass it on to
Dave Bonham, our Chief Financial Officer for additional financial and accounting details.
Over the first three quarters of 2018, Fairfax's book value per share increased by 2.7%,
adjusted for the $10 per share common dividend paid in the first quarter of 2018. Despite
the catastrophe losses in the quarter, our insurance companies continue to have good
results, with combined ratio of 97.6% with strong reserves and producing an underwriting
profit of $74 million in the quarter.
All of our major insurance companies with the exception of Brit, had combined ratios of
less than 100%, with Zenith at 80.3%, Northbridge at 89.5%, Odyssey Group at 97.5% and
Allied World at 96.7%. Third quarter operating income was again very strong at $250
million, while net gains on investments in the quarter were $41 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

As shown on page 42 of our quarterly report, our net investment gain of $41 million in the
quarter consisted of realized gains on our investment portfolio of $74 million, offset by
unrealized losses of $33 million. As we have mentioned in our annual meetings, annual
reports and quarterly calls, with IFRS accounting where stocks and bonds are recorded at
market and subject to market gains, or losses, quarterly and annual income will fluctuate
and investment results will only make sense over the long term.
All in, we had net earnings in the quarter of $106 million. Our insurance and reinsurance
businesses' net premium volume decreased -- sorry increased in the third quarter of 2018
versus 2017 by an aggregate of 6.5%, primarily due to premium growth at Northbridge of
10.8%, Odyssey of 6.6%, Crum & Forster at 7.8% and Brit at 10.2% as well as the
acquisition of our Latin American operations. This was offset by lower premiums written at
Allied World and Zenith and the sale of First Capital.
As you can see on page 72 of our quarterly report, the fair value of our investment in noninsurance associates and listed consolidated companies, such as Recipe, formerly Cara,
Grivalia, Thomas Cook, Fairfax India and Fairfax Africa is $5.2 billion versus a carrying value
of $4.8 billion and unrealized gain of approximately $400 million or $15 per share pre-tax
not on our balance sheet.
When you review our statements, please remember that when we own more than 20% of
a company, we equity account and when we own about 50%, we consolidate. So that
mark-to-market gains in these companies are not reflected in our results. Of note in the
third quarter were the following items. In July, we purchased a 11.2% ownership interest in
Brit from our minority partner OMERS for $252 million. Subsequent to this transaction,
Fairfax's ownership in Brit is now 88%.

FINAL

In September, Fairfax Africa entered into a $90 million credit facility. The facility matures in
September 2019 with an extension option for an additional year. There were no amounts
drawn on this facility at the end of September. Subsequent to the third quarter, early in
October, October RiverStone purchase a run-off portfolio written by a UK insurer prior to
2001. RiverStone assumes net insurance liabilities of approximately $562 million and return
for the cash payment to RiverStone of approximately $645 million.
Also in October, Fairfax India invested $60 million in common shares and warrants of the
Catholic Syrian Bank. Fairfax India has committed to a further invest approximately $104
million in common shares and warrants of the bank over the next 12 to 18 months. Once
completed, Fairfax India will have a 51% equity interest in the bank on a fully diluted basis.
The Bank was established in 1920 and is a private company headquartered in Thrissur,
India offering banking services through over 420 branches across the country. In recent
months, we have seen a general decline in the Indian markets and the Indian rupee. This
decline is likely attributable to several factors including rising commodity costs and liquidity
concerns at certain non-bank financial companies. However, all of our investments
continue to perform well and we believe this current correction will be short-lived.

Bloomberg Transcript

In the first nine months, we also put more of our cash to work, approximately $6.6 billion in
short-term, which is less than two years United States treasuries. Given the continued
strength in the US economy and the bias towards higher interest rates, we continue to be
focused on the short end of the treasury curve for the time being.
As of now, we have an annual run rate of approximately $800 million in interest and
dividend income. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, there are three investment items
to note. First, we sold our common share ownership in Arbor Memorial, Canada's largest
funeral home business for a gain of $112 million, which is more than three times our cost.
We want to thank David Scanlon and the entire Scanlon family for trusting us to help them
take Arbor private in 2012 and for treating us very well as partners. We wish them the very
best in the future as a leading Canadian private family company.
Another subsequent event, we would like to highlight is with Resolute Forest Products.
After many patient years of shareholders, Yves Laflamme and the Resolute team with the
guidance of our Brad Martin have provided shareholders with a $135 million special
dividend, which is approximately $44 million payable to Fairfax. We think there may be
more good things to come as Resolute is generating strong free cash flow and is keenly
focused on shareholder-friendly capital allocation.
Sporting Life and Golf Town under the direction of our partners, David and Patty Russell
and Chad McKinnon with the oversight of Bill Grigson have merged their companies. The
two profitable operations will be even stronger together with cooperation on a number of
fronts, but continuing to run their respective businesses on a decentralized basis.
We remain vigilant with holding company cash and marketable securities at over $1.7
billion. Always looking to be soundly financed first, we've begun to repurchase our

FINAL

partner's interest in our insurance companies as well as over the past 12 months, we have
purchased 656,000 of our shares at an aggregate cost of $347 million.
As we have said in the past, we believe the US administration's policies of reducing
corporate taxes to 21%, rolling back regulation on business and planned significant
infrastructures spending has the potential of boosting economic growth significantly in US
and prolonging the US business cycle. That said, our investment team at Hamblin Watsa is
cautiously observing events such as the upcoming US election next week and ongoing
negotiations on global tariffs, in particular with China.

Bloomberg Transcript

The trade policies of the US could precipitate a collapse in world trade, but we see these
risks potentially diminishing as US has recently announced that deal with Canada and
Mexico as well as potential deals with Europe as well as China. These global trade barrier
risks will continue to be very much monitored by Hamblin Watsa. With this backdrop, we
will continue to focus on picking good companies, which provide significant downside
protection and potential appreciation over the long term.
As of September 30, 2018, we have $9.2 billion in subsidiary cash and short-term
investments in our portfolio. In total, including short-dated US treasuries, we have
approximately 17.2 billion in cash and short-dated securities, which is approximately 50%
of our portfolio investments. Our investment portfolios will be largely unimpacted by rising
interest rates, as we have not reached for yield. With an annual run rate of approximately
16 billion in gross premiums, a singular focus on underwriting discipline and superior
reserving, and investment portfolio of approximately $40 billion, over 50% of which is in
cash and US Treasuries and the Hamblin Watsa, team constantly evaluating in the market,
we continue to believe there is tremendous opportunity for Fairfax shareholders over the
long term. I'll now pass the call over to David Bonham, our Chief Financial Officer.

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

Thank you, Paul. So in the third quarter of 2018, Fairfax's reported net earnings of $106
million or $3.34 per share on a fully diluted basis. And that compares to the third quarter
of 2017 when we reported net earnings of $477 million or $16.42 per share on a fully
diluted basis. For the first nine months of 2018, Fairfax's net earnings of $854 million or
$28.83 per fully diluted share and in the same period in 2017, we had $871 million or $33.13
per diluted share.
Underwriting profits at our insurance and reinsurance operations in the third quarter and
first nine months of 2018 improved to 74 million and 299 million with combined ratios of
98% and 97% in each of those respective periods, that's compared to underwriting losses
of 833 million and 617 million combined ratios of 130% and 109% in those respective
periods in 2017.
Higher underwriting profits in 2018 principally reflected lower current period catastrophe
losses, comprised principally of Typhoon Jebi in Japan, Mangkhut in the Philippines, Hong
Kong and Southern China and Hurricane Florence that affected the Carolinas and Cape
Verde.

FINAL

In the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, these events and some other attritional,
totaled $215 million and $312 million and represented seven combined ratio points on the
year-to-date, 4 combined ratio points on the quarter. Obviously, significantly lower than
the current period catastrophe losses of about 1 billion and 1.1 billion in those periods in
2017, representing 37 points on the quarter, 16 points year-to-date in 2017, and principally
the impact of hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria.
Our combined ratios also benefited from higher net favorable prior year reserve
development in the third quarter and first nine months of 2018 at 174 million and 372
million translating into six and four combined ratio points in each of those periods that
compared to net favorable development of 88 million and 299 million in those same
periods in 2017. Turning to net premiums written and adjusting for the impact of certain
2017 acquisitions in the sale of First Capital, net premiums written by our insurance and
reinsurance operations increased by 5% in the third quarter, 8% in the first nine months of
2018 and that primarily reflected growth at OdysseyRe, Northbridge, Crum & Forster and
Brit.

Bloomberg Transcript

So turning to the operating company results we'll start with Northbridge. Northbridge's
underwriting profits increased to $31 million and $16 million in the third quarter and first
nine months of 2018, combined ratios of 90% and 98% in those respective periods.
Compared to underwriting profits of 2 million and 6 million and combined ratios of 99% in
each of those same periods in 2017. The underwriting results in the third quarter and first
nine months of 2018, included net favorable reserve development of 37 million and 72
million, translating into 13 and 9 combined ratio points.
The underwriting results also in the third quarter and first nine months included 3 million
and 17 million of current period catastrophe losses and that principally related to several
storms in Ontario and Quebec. In Canadian dollar terms, net premiums written by
Northbridge in the third quarter and first nine months of '18 increased by 16% and 10% and
that reflected increased renewal business and price increases across the group.
Looking at Odyssey Group, it reported underwriting profits of 19 million and a 134 million
with combined ratios of 98% and 94% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2018.
That compared to underwriting losses of 168 million and 64 million combined ratios of
126% and 104% in the third quarter and first nine months of 2017. Current period
catastrophe losses of 77 million and 142 million represented 10 and 7 combined ratio
points the third quarter and first nine months of '18, principally related to Typhoon Jebi
and other attritional current period catastrophe losses.
Certainly lower than the losses of 262 million and 316 million, which represented 41 and 18
combined ratio points in the third quarter, first nine months of 2017 principally related to
HIM. Odyssey Group's combined ratio reflected the benefit of higher net favorable
development 66 million and 152 million and that principally related to property
catastrophe loss reserves, compared to net favorable reserve development of 43 million
and a 110 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2017.

FINAL

Odyssey Re Group wrote 706 million and 2.2 billion of net premiums in the third quarter
and first nine months, increases of 7% in the quarter, 16% in the year to date, reflecting
growth across all of its divisions. Moving on to Crum & Forster, Crum & Forster's
underwriting profits improved to 10 million and 18 million in the third quarter and first nine
months combined ratios of 98% and 99% in those respective periods, that was compared
to underwriting losses of 18 million and 12 million, combined ratios of 104% and 101% in the
third quarter and the first nine months last year.
Net prior year reserve development was nominal, in the third quarters and first nine
months of both 2018 and 2017. Crum & Forster's net premiums written increased by 8% in
both the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, again growth across several of its
lines of business. Zenith National reported underwriting profits in the third quarter and first
nine months of 41 million and 91 million combined ratios of 80% and 85%, compared to
underwriting profit of 34 million and 92 million with combined ratios of 84% and 85% in
those same periods in 2017.
The combined ratios in the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, included 11 and 10
combined ratio points of net favorable prior year reserve development compared to 8
and 10 combined ratio points in the third quarter and first nine months of 2017. Zenith
wrote 167 million and 638 million of net premiums in the third quarter and first nine
months of 2018, which was somewhat lower than the 175 million and 677 million of net
premiums in those respective periods in 2017. Decreases in net premiums written in 2018
primarily reflected price decreases. Looking at Brit in the third quarter and first nine
months, Brit produced underwriting losses of 33 million, 15 million and combined ratios of
108% and 101%, that compared to underwriting losses of 222 million and 199 million in
2017, combined ratios there was 158 in the quarter 118 year to date.
Current period catastrophe losses at Brit of 66 million and 70 million represented 17 and 6
combined ratio points in the third quarter and first nine months, principally related to
Typhoon Jebi and Hurricane Florence and that was lower than current period catastrophe
losses of 244 million and 245 million that represented 64 and 22 combined ratio points in
the third quarter and first nine months of 2017 again principally related to HIM.
Brit's net premium written increased by 10% and 6% in the third quarter and first nine
months of 2018. That reflected the contribution from initiatives that they've launched in
prior years, price increases, favorable impact of foreign currency translation, partially
offset by reductions in their non-core lines of business through active portfolio
management.
Allied World contributed 519 million and 1.9 billion to net premiums written in the third
quarter and first nine months of 2018. The underwriting profit improved to 20 million with
a combined ratio of 97% in the third quarter of 2018 compared to an underwriting loss of
416 million and a combined ratio of 182% in the third quarter of 2017. The improvement in
underwriting profitability principally reflected lower current period catastrophe losses,
which were 62 million or 10 combined ratio points in the third quarter of 2018, principally
related to Typhoon Jebi and Hurricane Florence compared to current period catastrophe
losses of $412 million or 82 combined ratio points in the third quarter of 2017 related to
HIM. Fairfax Asia recorded an underwriting profit of 1 million in an underwriting loss of 1

FINAL

million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, lower than the underwriting
profits of 15 million and 32 million in the same periods in 2017, which included the more
favorable results of First Capital, which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2017.
Insurance and Reinsurance: Other. The segment produced underwriting losses of 13
million and 19 million And combined ratios of 105%, 102% in the third quarter and first nine
months of 2018. Compared to underwriting losses of 60 million, 56 million, combined
ratios of 131 and 100 to 11% in those same periods in 2017. The improved underwriting
results in the third quarter and first nine months of 2018, again principally reflected the
lower current period catastrophe losses. Run Off reported operating losses of 49 million
and 102 million in the third quarter and first nine months of 2018 compared to operating
losses of 15 million and 95 million in those same periods in 2017.

Bloomberg Transcript

The increase in the operating loss in the third quarter of 2018 principally reflected higher
net adverse prior year reserve development primarily related to asbestos exposures. On
the consolidated front, interest and dividend income increased year-over-year from 152
million in the third quarter of 2017, to 194 million in the third quarter of 2018, principally
reflecting higher interest earned on increased holdings of short-dated US Treasury bonds,
partially offset by lower interest earned on US state and municipal bonds as a result of
sales during 2017 and 2018. Fairfax recorded a provision for income taxes of 71 million at a
32% effective tax rate in the third quarter 2018 and a provision for income taxes of a 140
million at a 10% effective tax rate in the first nine months of 2018. The higher effective tax
rate quarter-to-date primarily reflected losses at the holding company, which were not
recognized as a deferred tax assets.
The lower effective tax rate year-to-date primarily reflected the gain on the
deconsolidation of Quess which was not taxable. Our total debt to total capital ratio
increased to 26.8% at September 30 2018 from 25% at December 31, 2017 that primarily
was the result of a modest increase in total debt and decreased total capital. We ended
the third quarter of 2018 with an investment portfolio which included holding company
cash and investments of 39.1 billion, which was slightly lower than the 39.3 billion that we
held at December 31, 2017. And with that I'll pass it back over to you,

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

FINAL

Hey Thanks very much Jeff. Hi, good morning.

Q - Jeff Fenwick

And so I guess the topic everyone's always interested in is the investment side of things
there and continued evolution, this year of moving that cash into some of the shorter
dated bonds. And I think at this point, exiting the quarter you were still around 25% in the
in the cash position here. So what's the thinking in terms of that rebalancing? Do you feel
like you've got it approximately where you want it to be? I know you don't want to reach
for yield at the same time. I know you wanted to get some of that idle cash working for
you.

A - Paul Rivett

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 15350794 <GO>}

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Yeah, no, I think so, I think we've done that with, with the help of Brian Bradstreet in the
Hamblin Watsa team, Jeff. We've moved as you said, into the shorter dated Treasuries to
get our interest income up and so where we're at about 100, sorry 800 million now total
of interest and dividend income and an annual run rate. And so we're going to continue to
increase that. But we're not going to reach for yield and, but as we're watching the
markets where you see some volatility. We're seeing opportunities we've got dry powder
because we're roughly 50% in the short-dated US Treasuries and, and, and cash. So, and
like, like we talked about and we will continue to harvest some of our investments like we
just did with Arbor and and redeploy it and we're seeing some opportunities to redeploy
it.
But, but we are not particularly in these volatile markets going to reach for yields. So, and
you see the employment data coming out. Now we've got, we got some wage inflation. It
looks like potentially and so interest rates will probably continue to rise. So we'll be ready
for that as spreads widen and we can redeploy the short-term US Treasuries.

Q - Jeff Fenwick

{BIO 15350794 <GO>}

And I guess the second part there is just on the equities side in terms of the mix in the
total of the portfolio, I mean it any change in the, in the approach there at all? I mean,
doesn't really seem like it. I guess the the Seaspan investments probably a great example
of that you're willing to make some large bets where you see value. But what are you
thinking there in terms of the mix of equity or equity related investments?

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

So we're still, we're still continuing to look for the debt and warrant type transactions, so,
Jeff. So, and so we've got some opportunities there but, but there,there may be some
shuffling some some selling in this quarter and moving into some other interesting
interesting equity opportunities that -- and the team have been working on so. So we're
going to be opportunistic always, but we've got some interesting things that that are
close to being able to action on.

{BIO 15350794 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. And maybe just one quick one on the, on the insurance operations here, I just
noticed the the RiverStone transaction that you mentioned here, a fairly sizable runoff
book that you're taking in, it seems to be happening around the same time that you're
putting Advent into run-off. So maybe a bit of context around the decision to take that on
and how you're thinking about it from just for managing those moving parts.

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Yeah, so on that, Jeff. Great question. So we, on the RiverStone team is always looking for
good opportunities and this was one in particular that they've been working on for almost
a year and there is already an embedded quite a substantial embedded gain in that and
we're quite happy with it. We'll continue to look at other things, but, but we're always
going to be opportunistic and this is just a really great deal that Riverstone's found in the
got a good team. And so they're going to look, continue to look for other opportunities
but as it stands now, there isn't any others.

Operator
All right. I'll let someone else ask a question, thanks for that.

FINAL

So I wanted to ask one question on the investment portfolio. And then one on the
underwriting side. So starting with the investment portfolio. Paul, I heard your macro view,
sounds like nothing's really changed. So I guess my question is there, what would need to
changed -- or maybe it's more than one thing versus of more than one thing. What would
need to change for you to become become either more defensively positioned or to look
at sort of asset pricing dislocation opportunities things that Fairfax has done very well in
the past to take advantage of ?

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Yes, what I think as it stands now, where as you know, Paul. We're very conservatively
focused. So with that, over 50% in cash and short-term US Treasuries. We're conservative
relative to our peers. We're always going to be opportunistic and we're seeing volatility
and we'll watch as corporate spreads widen we might decide to go longer, but, but for
now. You know it's looking like the US economy is continuing to do very well and the
business cycle may may prolong, longer than people expect, and corporate earnings
continue to come in strong but, but things can change. I mean next. We've got a pivotal
US election could change things and obviously it's a crucial meeting coming up between
China and the US on trade. So Hamblin Watsa team, [ph] Prem, Brian, Roger, Wade
Lawrence all watching this stuff very carefully every, every day, but we feel very
comfortable where we are very, very conservatively positioned right now.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Okay and then just to follow up on that. And I want to be clear on this, nothing
philosophically has changed in terms of your appetite to express macro views through the
use of derivatives, such as the CDS where you had a huge gain and '08 and '09, like both
types of options are still on the table, as you see fit.

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

As you know Paul, we're continue to be opportunistic and but from a hedging perspective,
very unlikely that we'll hedge again, and there's really no need to given we're already very
conservative relative to our peers very comfortable where we are with the 50% of our
portfolio nearly 20 billion in cash and US Treasuries.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Okay, fair enough. And then my question on the underwriting side, just wondering how all
of the changes taking place at Lloyd's are impacting your Syndicate through Brit? My
impression is we should probably expect premiums to shrink with a focus on margins, but
maybe you can tell me more directly what should, we expect on Brit.

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Yeah. So I think you can expect more of the same, probably Paul, you know we're are
seeing net premium's increasing and we're seeing some price increasing, Lloyd's has said
that they want to reduce volumes and so that's good, generally for pricing. So Brit's taking
advantage of that and so we're again always focused on combined ratio of 95% or less
and good reserving. But, we're seeing opportunities. Brit's seeing opportunities as Lloyd's
shrinking a little bit here.

Our next question is coming from Mark Dwelle of RBC Capital Market. Your line is open,
Mark.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Yeah, good morning. Just a couple of fairly quick questions here. You mentioned the
special dividend, that you'll be receiving from resolute when that gets booked, is that
going to be booked as just regular dividend income or is that going to run through the
capital gains and losses lines as you know, the way we normally mark affiliate earnings?

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi, Mark. Yeah that resolute's in equity-accounted investment. So when we get that in
there, it will actually reduce the carrying value of our equity method carrying value for
Resolute will be in our income statement.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Got it. Okay, that's first question. The second one, you mentioned the asbestos charge in
the Runoff segment was that pursuant to the normal kind of end of the year actuarial
review or was that some specific one-off reserve ad.

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

So, in run off you're right, it tends to be, these are fairly lumpy claims. So there, they're
larger kind of one-offs and that's what you're seeing coming through in the third quarter,
our reserve review, we do as of September 30th, so we'll be reviewing all that in the
fourth quarter, and in respect of the third quarter for our year-end reporting.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Okay. That's what I thought. On the reserve review, I was just, I was curious it wasn't
accelerated a quarter. Last question I have is, do you have any early sense of how your
hurricane Michael claims might come out? Any type of suggestion of what the range a loss
there might look like?

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Yes. So, good question, Mark. They're coming in line with our expectations. So we're very
comfortable and don't think it's going to be material.

Buyback --buyback activity doesn't seem maybe as though it's as aggressive as it could
be, since you guys articulated a strategy of being more aggressive, maybe 9 or 12 months
ago, and it seems to have slowed a bit recently at a time when if anything and it may have
been an opportunity to ramp it up a bit. Just wondering if you could rearticulate your
thoughts there?

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Yeah, so no-- great question, great question, George. So we always want to be soundly
financed, that's, you know, that's the first priority. But we'll be opportunistic and we have
been over the last 12 months, but our first priority is to buy in minority interest from our
partners, which we did and you know it-- you're right, we would like to, to buy in more and
the recent price movements during the blackout unfortunately we couldn't take
advantage of, but 656,000 shares over the last 12 months is pretty good, you know $347
million deployed there, so we'll continue to do that opportunistically though, it is a focus.

Q - George Smith

{BIO 3506966 <GO>}

Fair to assume we might pick the activity up in light of what we've seen with the stock?

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

You know, at these prices, it certainly could, we don't want to forecast, but certainly like
the stock at this price.

Q - George Smith

{BIO 3506966 <GO>}

And in terms of equity portfolio. I'm also trying to get this a better feel for direction, you
know you guys just speaking towards opportunities just talking about minority stakes in

Page 12 of 21

very big liquid well known public companies or do you have your eye on some form of
controlling positions and I guess, something a little less vanilla?

FINAL

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

No. So we're always opportunistic, George. So we really are and continue to be focused
on transactions like Seaspan, where we can get partnered, whether its minority or control,
it doesn't matter, the more important thing, quite frankly, is really good management with
a long-term track record and companies like Seaspan we've got that with Bing Chen and
David Sokol, masterful capital allocators. So, so we'll do those types of transactions every
day of the week.

Q - George Smith

{BIO 3506966 <GO>}

We also I think a renewed emphasis, if you go back a year ago on achieving kind of a
double-digit, let's say, low to mid teens annual compound return or return on equity, which
I think would be awfully difficult to achieve with the cash balance, it's great that interest
rates have moved up and are picking up a little bit more on the cash and such. I just, I
don't get how we're going to get to that target with that, yeah, because of our portfolio,
yielding 2%.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Yeah, no, no. You're absolutely right. That's a good question, George. So for us it's just
taking a long-term focus and just being patient and opportunistic, and we've been
cautious throughout and having 50% of our portfolio, roughly $20 billion in cash and US
Treasury, short-term US Treasuries, we're just dry powder waiting --Brian Bradstreet and
the team, to the extent that spreads really gap out will be ready for it. On the equity side,
we continue to see really, really interesting opportunities things in this volatile market.
Things are starting to pop out and you will be seeing hopefully if we can execute some
interesting new buys in this quarter.

Q - George Smith

{BIO 3506966 <GO>}

Any sectors you can speak towards? That, I mean, where you're talking to detail whether -it's building or energy or whatever it may be where you're, you think there is more
opportunity?

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

No, we're quite agnostic. So, we are not, we don't really focus on particular industries
we've, as you saw, we've monetized Arbor with the funeral home business, we've looked
at things in the oil and gas, we're looking for. Again, we're looking for good value buying
in less than intrinsic with good management with a long-term record and and we have
really good deal flow in that, in that regard, George. So we're, if there is good value out
there, we're seeing it, but we don't try and focus on any particular sector.

Q - George Smith

{BIO 3506966 <GO>}

It sounds like we'll be hearing more soon on some of these deals.

Next question is coming from Jamie Gloyn from National Bank Financial. Please go ahead.

Q - Jamie Gloyn
Yeah, hi, good morning.

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Good morning, Jamie.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jamie Gloyn
First question is regarding the other reporting segments. I noticed that it looks like
margins were coming down in pretty much all the segments: Restaurants, Retail, India,
Thomas Cook. I'm wondering if you can just sort of give us a little bit more color as to
what's going on in each of those segments that might of drove that.

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

That's, margins they haven't really been declining I don't think, necessarily, Jamie. So it's
depending on the industry, if you look at Recipe for instance, they've got same restaurant
sales increasing. I think over the quarter-to-quarter, we tend not to look at quarter-toquarter fluctuations. But from a year-over-year perspective, all of the particularly the noninsurance investments continue to perform very well.
Our private company investments: Toys "R" Us, Sporting Life and Golf Town, doing very
well, and Recipe, like I said, continues to do well from a same restaurant sales
perspective, the fluctuations you might be seeing might be currency fluctuations in places
like India and Africa where currency has has declined, but we think that's probably a
temporary thing, if you take a long-term view.

Q - Jamie Gloyn
Okay, thank you. And then just in terms of the, the gains that you talked about the Arbor
Memorial, are there any other monetizations that have occurred at quarter end?

Page 14 of 21



Company N ame: Fairfax Financial H oldings L td
Company Ticker: FFH CN Equity
Date: 2018-11-02

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

FINAL

No, not of any, not from any material perspective Jamie. but there's a lot that we have,
that we are currently looking at potentially monetizing. Don't know when, because we
obviously want to get a good price, but we are looking and that there may be a few in the
next-- next few quarters.

Q - Jamie Gloyn
Okay, great. And couple more here. Just in terms of the global catastrophe experience,
when we talk about like North American experience, usually sort of like 1.5% before
government covers come into play. Is that the same when we sort of think about global
CATs like in Japan for example, the two typhoons that were highlighted this quarter, is
that sort of the same type of exposure that Fairfax expect, is that about that 1% to 1.5%?

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Absolutely right Jamie, that continues to be our experience that's what we've just seen in
the recent three catastrophes. We were around 170 million of losses there on an industry
loss of somewhere in the neighborhood of 12 billion, so it's right in line exactly with that 1%
to 1.5%.

Q - Jamie Gloyn

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay, thanks. And given the -- given the still elevated CAT experience. I would say, though
it's lower than 2017. Do you have any thoughts or comments on pricing heading into 2019
at this point or is it still too early?

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

No, from our perspective, it's probably still too early, but we are seeing it flat to slightly
up. We're seeing pricing in some lines up, in some lines, a little bit down, like workers'
comp pricing seems to be firming and going up a little bit. So, but it's early days here but-but it does look like it could be positive.

Q - Jamie Gloyn
Okay. And if I could just a few quick questions on some of the insurance operating
segments. Northbridge: really solid quarter from that entity. Can you-- can you sort of
maybe go into some of the details of what we saw some improvement in personal lines
Commercial Auto and then some net favorable reserve development. Are these
sustainable performance numbers or is there something going on in the quarter that
might have caused a little bit of performance?

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

No, I think these are sustainable for Northbridge. So what you're seeing is the benefit of
price increases that Paul mentioned, so low single digits. And if you look back a few years
Northbridge is taken some underwriting initiatives to move into other more profitable
segments targeting small, mid-sized businesses and the like that are-- that are just
inherently offering a little bit more profitability to us. So I think that's right. We've also,

Page 15 of 21



Company N ame: Fairfax Financial H oldings L td
Company Ticker: FFH CN Equity
Date: 2018-11-02

we've also seen better experience in the trucking segment as well in Northbridge. So I
think you can expect to see that continue.

FINAL

Q - Jamie Gloyn
Okay. So that's a declining trend of favorable developments. We would say that's kind of
stunted at this point, it'll be back to sort of that sort of low double-digit levels on
development and obviously pricing is going to help in the next three four quarters sort of
thing. Is that fair?

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Yeah. We'll have a look at the reserve development in Q3. Right now we think we're
adequate with adequate with some conservatism, so we'll see how that plays out over
time. And for the last 5 years, it's been roughly 3% to 5% year-over-year. So we expect
that to continue obviously can't forecast, but that looks to be the trend.

Q - Jamie Gloyn
Okay and then in Crum, commentary around growing in the right businesses and then
GBW is in Accident & Health, Commercial Transportation. Multi-Peril, some other ones that
are highlighted here. What are you seeing in those business lines? What's good about
those business lines today? Is there just firming markets are competitive dynamics are
shifting what's going on there?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

I think on these lines, these are the ones that Crum is just focused on growing. They've
got in niche advantages in these segments. They've spent time in developing them
through in some cases acquiring MGAs that specialize in that, so that they can just retain
more of the profitable business and again, I think you're seeing the effects of some of the
initiatives that they've taken in prior years and that's coming through, you know, in an
improvement on the accident year loss ratio.

Q - Jamie Gloyn
Okay and maybe just to wrap it up with a more overall broad seam obviously targeting
95% combined ratios. We've been a little bit higher here for let's say, five or six quarters.
Do you feel like you're on the path right now where you get back to that 95% run rate
here in the next quarter or two or is that going to take a little bit longer?

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

No, no, I think obviously Jamie. We don't forecast, but we do continue to think that 95% is
achievable. So that's our focus and we do think we'll be able to get there.

Q - Jamie Gloyn
Okay, thanks.

Company Ticker: FFH CN Equity
Date: 2018-11-02

Hi, good morning. Well, good afternoon here. Good morning to you. Yes, thank you for
your presentation earlier on. I just got two very quick ones. The gentlemen, one before
last, asked about the 95% combined ratio. Just following up on that, I think it was at the
AGM, Prem gave us a very interesting insight as to one of the smaller insurance
subsidiaries that came out of the group and said that we just don't think we can get to
that, so they sort of volunteered, I think it was to be rolled into Brit, it was a very
interesting sort of insight as to the deep dive that you're doing to try to make sure that
you can deliver the 95%. So first question really is, it's just having done that across the
group. And if it for some period of time. Now just-in-all, still bit that you think that you've
got to do things ways to got to deliver the 95 or do you really think now that across a
very, very large percentage of the sort of underwriting capacity you can do that without
really any many sort of more major changes?

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Yeah, and a great question, Andrew. We really don't think any changes are necessary.
We're very happy with where we're positioned now on each of the companies and and
we believer on, more on target and on plan. And yes or no, we're not expecting to do any
anymore movements of any kind with the companies.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Andrew Hollingworth

{BIO 1896571 <GO>}

That's really clear, if I can just one very brief follow-up and that's obviously the discussion
earlier on about the buyback in the use of capital and so. And I think you made it very clear
that you obviously your priorities to really to buy out the minority stakes in the insurance
subsidiaries that that you want to do and then obviously that competes with the capital for
the buyback. I'm just help me out, I'm not an insurance analyst day to day. So roughly, what
is the quantum of capital that you would ultimately, we want to deploy to buy out those
minorities likely going to be offered to you are able to you to buyout that in the next 3 to
4 years?

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

You're asking, Andrew. The total capital over 3 to 5 years?

Q - Andrew Hollingworth

{BIO 1896571 <GO>}

Yeah. If you were able to buyout everything that you want to be able to buy out rather
than your own shares, what would that come to?

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Yeah. So I think what we're certainly, we're going to, we're going to be buying out the
remainder of the minority interest in Brit over the next couple of years and Eurolife as
well, maybe even sooner. Maybe in the next year or so, those would be the focus. First,
are Brit and Eurolife

Q - Andrew Hollingworth

{BIO 1896571 <GO>}

Okay. I can do the math on those. That's great, thank you very much.

Good morning, Luis.

Q - Luis Hernandez

{BIO 6987647 <GO>}

Yes. Yes, hello, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. All right. Well, the first one
is I just want you was wondering, which is your biggest product non-insurance business
right now we're not Cara and all that get public. I'm a little confused, which one is your
biggest non-insurance operation in a wholly owned?

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Wholly owned? From largest investments, that would would be probably BlackBerry and
Seaspan. But but our largest wholly-owned I'm just looking at Dave here would probably
be.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Dave Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

I don't know about wholly owned Thomas Cook is a fair size, one of our companies. I think
the next one.

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

And in Toys "R" Us is quite large now, but but yeah and others there they're wholly owned.
But certainly our investments. So from an investment perspective would be much larger in
Seaspan.

Q - Luis Hernandez

{BIO 6987647 <GO>}

Yeah. Just wanted to know the non-insurance, up like a private business. But, okay, that's
okay. And then the second question is regarding, you just also published the Fairfax India
results. And I just wanted to hear your comments on the revaluation on Sanmar and BIAL
Airport? I wasn't sure if that was profit driven or simply a revaluation of the assets. So,
yeah, that's --?

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Yeah. So, no, good question. So, on the Sanmar transaction, as you know, that's not going
to be completed until 2019 and we use the discount rate in that valuation, it's fairly
significant due to these remaining market uncertainties. So, now Dave, you want to add
anything to that?

FINAL

Yeah, with the Sanmar investment, we made it a few years ago and there were some
projects that they were undertaking and -- but we are was just conservative and waiting
for the projects to unfold and become operational and we started to see that now. So
that, that resulted in a review of the valuation and a bit of an increase.

Q - Luis Hernandez

{BIO 6987647 <GO>}

Okay. And also on the BIAL?

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Yes, on the Bangalore Airport? Yeah, so currently we own 54% now of the Bangalore
Airport and with that particular revaluation, I think it was on discounted cash flow, is what
we applied there. And so, we're currently building out the second runway, Luis. So, we're
seeing traffic volume through that airport increase dramatically. Basically, the entire
population of Canada roughly went through that airport in year, about 33 million people,
and it's on its way to 50 million or thereabout once we build the second terminal.
So, doing quite well there. But, Dave, I don't know if you wanted to add anything on
valuation?

A - Dave Bonham
