Shinichi Hara

{BIO 17738151 <GO>}

I am Hara from NKSJ Holdings. Thank you very much for attending our meeting today. I am
sure you're tired by now at this late hour but please bear with us for a little bit longer.
What I am going to explain today is only the first half results, the business forecast for the
full fiscal year of 2012 and shareholder return for this fiscal year. As for the revision of
NKSJ Group management plan announced today, President Sakurada will explain in detail
at the IR Meeting to be held on our Head Office in Nishishinjuku from 3 o'clock in the
afternoon on November 26. If you cannot attend this IR meeting, please refer to the
presentation materials and a video posted onto our website after the meeting is over.
Now let me start the presentation of our financial results.
Please take a look at page two, this shows the NKSJ Holdings consolidated results for the
first half in P&C and life insurance business top line grew, with P&C business by 3% and
life insurance by 1.2%. However, as disclosed on November 2nd we posted impairment
loss on securities of 105.9 billion yen and therefore ordinary loss of 55 billion yen was
posted, and net loss was 37.3 billion yen for the first half.
Please turn to page three, this shows the business forecast for fiscal year 2012 on the
consolidated basis, we revised the forecast announced at the beginning of this fiscal year
and expect ordinary loss of 4 billion yen and net loss of 28 billion yen.

Page 1 of 17



Company N ame: Sompo H oldings I nc

Date: 2012-11-19

The reason for this significant downward revision is because we assumed impairment
losses on securities used as a prerequisite for the forecast to be at the same level of 105
billion yen as the first half. At the beginning of the year the assumption was 31 billion yen.

FINAL

This revision is reflected in this slide under the column called change at the far right hand
side in the row of Sompo Japan and Nipponkoa of 35 billion yen in the negative number
and consolidated adjustment and others of 27 billion yen.
Please turn to page four. This shows adjusted consolidated profits in the past and the
forecast for this fiscal year. The adjusted consolidated profit is expected to be 54.4 billion
yen, representing a significant recovery.
Since adjusted profits do not reflect impairment losses on securities, they are different
from profit and loss on financial accounting basis.
Domestic P&C insurance business still in the red with losses of 40.9 billion yen but the
amount of losses will be reduced from the previous fiscal year where there was flooding
in Thailand.

Bloomberg Transcript

The domestic life insurance business will remain unchanged, while the overseas business
is expected to be ahead of 3.6 billion yen from the forecast at the beginning of this fiscal
year.
And on the right hand side of the slide, NKSJ Group management target for fiscal year
2015 announced today is shown and this will be explained at the IR meeting on November
26.
And this is the main points of consolidated results for the first half of fiscal year 2012 on
page five, breakdown of 55 billion yen in consolidated ordinary losses is shown.
Underwriting profits in P&C insurance businesses are shown on the left hand side 4.6
billion yen.
The factors behind this will be explained on the next page and the stagnant domestic
stock market has led to impairment losses on securities which affected the profits heavily.
The impact is incorporated in the negative 10.7 billion yen under investment profit column,
second from the left, and negative 49.3 billion yen under other consolidation adjustment,
second from the right.
Life insurance and overseas businesses contributed 2.5 billion yen and 4.1 billion yen to the
profits respectively.
On page six, you can see the breakdown of our domestic P&C business underwriting
profit. The total was 4.6 billion yen, but excluding the special factors of Great East Japan
Earthquake and flooding in Thailand, the underwriting profit loss would have been 12.7
billion yen in losses.

FINAL

Main factors include, domestic natural disasters such as severe storms in April and
persistently high loss ratio in the mainstay automobile insurance business. On the other
hand, flooding in Thailand contributed by 17 billion yen in surplus due to reversal of
catastrophic loss reserve in September with the progress with payments of claims and
decrease of net loss incurred due to the impact of the yen's appreciation. As a result,
underwriting profit was 4.6 billion yen.
Page seven. This shows the breakdown of consolidated net loss of 37.3 billion yen for the
first half. As in ordinary losses, the main factors was, increased impairment losses on
securities reflecting a stagnant domestic stock market.
And next I will talk about the results by business, starting with domestic P&C insurance
business.
Page nine. This shows domestic P&C insurance top-line status. Growth rates in premiums
compared to the same month in the previous year on the performance evaluation basis is
shown, growth rates have been settling down from temporary high levels, but still remain
in the positive territory on the year-on-year basis mainly due to the positive effect from
amended premium rates in auto insurance products.

Bloomberg Transcript

Page 10 is earned and incurred loss ratio. In last fiscal year, there were two large typhoons
in September which pushed up the loss ratio significantly, but this fiscal year, there was
heavy impact from natural disasters including severe storms in April. So the loss ratio is
almost the same level as the same period last year at 68.6%. The slight decrease in loss
ratio was due to the increase in net premiums written.
The other line shows earned incurred loss ratio excluding the impact of natural disasters,
it dropped by 0.5 percentage point year-on-year to 61.4%. Like the ratio including natural
disasters, the loss incurred stayed at higher levels with slight increase but it was offset by
increase in net premiums written and therefore the loss ratio declined.
The box on the right shows the business forecast for fiscal year 2012, the loss ratio
including natural disasters is expected to be 68.6%, in the last fiscal year due to the
flooding in Thailand it was high as 73% for the full year but we expect a substantial
recovery this fiscal year, but when excluding domestic natural disasters and flooding in
Thailand, mainly due to increase in losses incurred in auto insurance we expect a decline
of 1.2 percentage points to 64.4%.
Page 11 here you can see changes in the net expense ratio as the lower line graph shows
there was almost no change year-on-year and as you can see inside the right hand side
box we expect full year ratio to remain almost the same as in the previous year with
company expense ratio of 17%.
Please turn to page 12, here you can see the combined ratio excluding the effects of
CALI, financial guarantee and household earthquake insurance. For the first half of this
fiscal year due to natural disasters in Japan combined ratio worsened significantly to

Page 3 of 17



Company N ame: Sompo H oldings I nc
Company Ticker: 8630 JP Equity
Date: 2012-11-19

103.5% year-on-year, the real line graph represents the combined ratio excluding natural
disasters as you can see there was almost no change year-on-year just a slight increase.

FINAL

Right hand box shows full year forecast combined ratio excluding all factors is expected to
be 100% as shown at the bottom, incurred losses for automotive insurance are assumed
to increase in the second half, so we expect a year-on-year deterioration of 1.2
percentage points.
Page 13. You can see the automotive insurance earned incurred loss ratio on the basis
excluding the impact of natural disasters in Japan. Through rate revisions, premiums which
are the denominator increased resulting in a year-on-year improvement of 2.5
percentage point. However as we expect losses incurred to increase in the second half,
on a full year basis, we expect a worsening by a 0.5 percentage point to 71.7% as shown
on the right hand side box.
Page 14. You can see year-on-year changes in the quarterly number of reported claims
which we deem as a leading indicator for claims paid. They are moving steadily with
almost no change year-on-year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Page 15. Effect of natural disasters in Japan is shown. In addition to a severe storm in April
and tornado and hail disasters in May, there were several major typhoons during this
period. Incurred losses totaled 50.2 billion yen, already reaching the usual full year
estimate of 50 billion yen. In light of this situation, full forecast has been revised upward
from previously forecasted 50 billion yen to 58 billion yen.
Page 16, you can see the impact of flooding in Thailand. Decrease in outstanding loss
reserve owing to the depreciation of the Thai baht and reversal of catastrophic loss
reserve brought about a profit of 19.8 billion yen altogether. That is the impact on the
ordinary income, that's because progress in paid claims between Sompo Japan and
Nipponkoa together 11.6 billion yen for the first half fiscal 2012, on a cumulative basis from
last fiscal year 29.7 billion yen is the amount.
Payment completion rate was 40% on a cumulative basis.
Next, domestic life insurance business on page 18.
Let me first talk about ANP annualized premiums which represent the outcome of sales
activities as we are promoting shift to protection type products, ANP for saving type of
products on the right hand side decreased by 3.7 billion year-on-year added with the
impact of ending the sale of short term payment income compensation insurance that
had been previously sold by former Nipponkoa Life.
Protection type product ANP decreased by 1.7 billion as shown on the left hand side, the
total ANP declined by 5.4 billion yen, although overall ANP fell, sale of more profitable
products such as medical insurance and the income compensation insurance was
maintained at high level, we'll continue to stick to the sales policy emphasizing protection
Page 4 of 17



Company N ame: Sompo H oldings I nc
Company Ticker: 8630 JP Equity
Date: 2012-11-19

type products so as to further expand sales of protection type products in the second half
and onward.

FINAL

Page 19, next I would like to talk about income from insurance premiums on P&L, premium
income growth was kept to a meager 0.3% for this first half year-on-year. However,
income from insurance premiums excluding low margin lump-sum payment products
increased by 4.4% securing a certain growth rate.
Page 20. Next I would like to explain about accounting basis profits. In NKSJ Group,
domestic life insurance is positioned as a growth area and personnel is being shifted from
P&C insurance to expand the life insurance business. After absorbing the expenses
associated with this personnel transfer, basic profit improved to 5.1 billion yen in the first
half by 6.7 billion from the loss of 1.6 billion a year before.
Net income improved by 5.9 billion yen to 1.3 billion yen in the first half from 4.5 billion yen
in losses posted year before.

Bloomberg Transcript

Next I would like to discuss overseas insurance business. Please take a look at page 22.
The top-line growth on the left was mostly maintained on the local currency basis in each
of the subsidiaries.
But on a yen basis, it dropped mainly because of the depreciation of real at our Brazilian
subsidiaries. The profit increased significantly as you can see in the right hand graph but
this is mainly due to change in outstanding loss reserve for flooding in Thailand and onetime investment profits at European subsidiaries. So if we exclude them, the profit was
mostly inline with the plan at the beginning of the year.
Next I would like to talk about business forecast for the fiscal year 2012, page 24 please.
The breakdown of 4 billion yen in consolidated ordinary profit projected for fiscal year
2012 is shown here.
Underwriting profit in domestic P&C insurance business will be, continued to be, see
losses from auto insurance while reversal of catastrophic loss reserve related to flooding
in Thailand will make positive contribution in the investments while realized gains on
securities will push up the profits, impairment losses on securities will have heavy negative
impact.
Page 25, this table shows -- focuses on domestic P&C insurance business, the right most
column indicates change from the forecast at the beginning of the fiscal year. Net
premiums written have been increased based on the most recent development. On the
other hand, downward revision has been made from the forecast at the beginning of the
year to the loss ratio assuming insurance claims and losses incurred in auto insurance will
increase in the second half.
The expense ratio is expected improve by 1 percentage point from the forecast at the
beginning of the year because as we revise the system integration method, post
Page 5 of 17



Company N ame: Sompo H oldings I nc
Company Ticker: 8630 JP Equity
Date: 2012-11-19

integration a majority of the system integration cost assumed to be incurred in this fiscal
year has been moved down to the next fiscal year and onward, as a result, combined
ratio excluding special factors is expected to be deteriorated by 0.8 point to 104.4%.

FINAL

Page 26 shows the functions of business forecast for the domestic P&C insurance
business, I like to skip the explanation.
Page 27 please, this shows the plan for adjusted EV increase in domestic life insurance,
increase expected is 85 billion yen which is unchanged from the forecast at the beginning
of the year.
At the middle of this table, you can see that we expect adjusted EV increase of 85 billion
yen as compared to 100 billion yen posted in the fiscal year 2011.
On page 28 accounting basis profits, the basic profit is expected to be 10 billion yen for
this fiscal year up 4.1 billion yen from the 5.8 billion yen in the previous fiscal year. And net
income for fiscal year 2012 as shown in the table on the right is expected to be 3.6 billion
yen in surplus, as we'll not post merger related cost which was incurred in 2011.

Bloomberg Transcript

Since we are ahead of the plan in progressing -- reducing operating expenses, we have
upwardly revised both basic profit and net income from the previous business forecast.
Next, page 29 or actually page 30, I will be talking about the balance sheet concerns
starting from this page. On page 30, you can see the Japanese standard solvency margin
ratio of three core companies, they all far exceed the regulatory margin of 200%.
Please turn to page 31, here you can see the state of capital and risk on internal standard
economic value basis.
For risk measurement, we are using value at risk at the confidence level at 99.95% which is
tantamount to AA rating. The results of the measurement indicate the buffer or the
difference between the capital and risk totals of the 300 billion solvency ratio in which
capital is divided by risk is 121%. We believe this level is appropriate from the perspective
of maintaining a certain level of buffer to sustain soundness even in the face of a risk.
On the right hand side, you can see the respective sensitivity of solvency ratio to changes
in various market indices.
Page 32, the asset portfolio starting with P&C insurance. The general account is managed
with diversified investments, while saving type account utilizes portfolio management
based on ALM. As for general account which accounts for 70% of the total, the
composition of domestic sales -- stocks declined from the level at the beginning of the
fiscal year due to such factors as falling stock prices, still they account for over 30%, we
believe further reduction in exposure is a challenge we need to work on, duration gap
between the asset and liabilities is relatively small or short at about one year. And
therefore the interest rate, this is limited.
Page 6 of 17

FINAL

Page 33, the asset portfolio for domestic life insurance mostly invested in yen
denominated assets, with limited asset liability duration gap, overall we are maintaining a
very conservative portfolio.
Page 34, exposure to GIIPS countries, and that was limited to begin with, but over the six
month period, we further reduced the exposure down to 21.8 billion yen for the entire
Group as of the end of September, this means 1.2% of the adjusted consolidated assets,
a level that is easily manageable we intend to further reduce exposure, paying close
attention to the movement in the market.
Page 35, financial guarantee, posted a loss of 0.2 billion during the first half as for
exposure, the primary insurance ABS-CDOs guarantees which had been the main loss
factor in the past, were all settled in fiscal 2011.
In the graph you can see the total amount of ABS-CDO insured amount, summing up the
primary insurance and assumed treaty insurance, but the primary is zero and the assumed
treaty reinsurance is barely under, so the insured amount net of loss reserve is close to
zero.

Page 36, you can see the progress in reducing the strategic holdings stocks, the planned
amount for the fiscal year is 127.1 billion yen, 8 billion yen in stocks, 88 -- or 58.7 billion yen
in stock futures, a total of 66.7 billion yen reduction in exposure has been implemented,
we'll continue to sell strategic holdings stocks, closely watching the market new
movement.
Finally shareholder return, on the slide you can see the paper we released today, the
point is that while we lowered the estimated dividend for the full year from 80 yen to 60
yen, we'll implement share buyback with corresponding amount to maintain a total
amount of the shareholder return, we expect to pay midyear dividend starting at fiscal
2013 and we'll explain this further next Monday and the rest are the data, this concludes
my presentation, thank you very much.

Questions And Answers
Operator
The first question is from Mr. Okamoto of Merrill Lynch Japan Securities.

Q - Mitsumasa Okamoto

{BIO 1513316 <GO>}

Thank you. In your presentation you have said, loss incurred in automobile insurance is
expected to deteriorate in the second half, from the initial assumption, and that system
development related cost will be moved down to the next fiscal year onward.
So if you look at the data section of the materials, the forecast has been changed and the
non-personnel cost has been reduced, so one could imagine that the amount seems to

Page 7 of 17



Company N ame: Sompo H oldings I nc
Company Ticker: 8630 JP Equity
Date: 2012-11-19

FINAL

be about 20 billion yen. Am I correct? And why did you decide to shift the posting of the
system cost to next fiscal year? Is it somewhat related to the integration?
My second question, the sale of strategic holding stocks has been making steady
progress as you can see from the tables, you changed assumption of Nikkei average and
increased the expected impaired losses on securities but planned realized gains and
losses has not been changed. Is there any particular reason for that? Are you planning to
accelerate the sale? Is that the reason behind this?

A - Corporate Participant
Now system cost was forecast to be 23.4 billion yen at the beginning of the year for this
fiscal year. In this revised forecast, it was reduced to about 7 billion yen, down 17 billion
yen. The reason for this is because the integration method has been changed to merger
method which has led to the change in the system integration method as well and that's
why we moved down the timing of the recognition of the cost.

Bloomberg Transcript

And with regard to the gain on sale of stocks, our assumption for the stock market at the
end of the fiscal year 2012 has been reduced to the level as of the end of September
which is certainly more than 8800 yen. Accordingly, the expected impairment losses on
securities has been reduced significantly as we announced.
On the other hand, the amount of gain on sale of stocks has been basically unchanged.
We do not plan at this moment to increase the amount of reduction substantially. The
planned reduction of 300 billion yen for three years or the 127.1 billion yen for this fiscal
year should be achieved. Therefore, if the stock market stays at around 8,000 yen or
certainly more than that as it is presently, then what Mr. Okamoto forecasted will likely
happen.
On the other hand, as you can see from the graph, we have taken short positions with
stock futures, thereby reducing the exposure level substantially already.
With regard to the timing of taking short positions especially at Nipponkoa, at the
beginning of this fiscal year short positions in the amount planned to be sold by the end
of this fiscal year has been taken with Nikkei average at slightly more than 10,000 yen.
So while the gain on sale of stocks in cash market will be reduced, we can expect gain on
sale of futures, therefore we expect the impact from the drop in stock market to be
mitigated to some extent. Thank you.

Next question is from Mr. Muraki from Deutsche Securities.

Q - Masao Muraki

FINAL

My first question has to do with share buyback. When do you expect to start receiving
dividends from your subsidiaries, enabling you to buy back shares? That is my first
question, and secondly, the loss ratio in automobile insurance was improved in the first
half as you said in the presentation and yet you are expecting quite high level of loss ratio
for the full year, will it be possible for the loss ratio to sore this much just because the unit
amount of claims paid increased or you may be just on the conservative side in this
forecast. Could you just share your assumptions with us?

A - Corporate Participant
As for the first question on share buyback, our basic philosophy is the following; with
regard to shareholder return for the fiscal year 2012, dividends will be paid in June in 2013
and share buyback will be conducted in fiscal year 2013.
In other words, our understanding is that whatever we do our shareholder return in fiscal
year 2013 is based on the performance of fiscal year 2012. So what we have announced in
fiscal year 2012 will be carried out in fiscal year 2013. And let me explain the reason why
we will buy back shares in 2013 and not immediately, I would assume you asked this
question because your understanding is that we need dividends from subsidiaries to fund
the share buyback but we can always borrow money from subsidiaries to finance the
share buyback.

Bloomberg Transcript

So the funding is not a crucial constraint. It is because we recognize that shareholder
return for fiscal year 2012 should be implemented in fiscal year 2013.

Q - Masao Muraki

{BIO 3318668 <GO>}

If that is the case, should we expect the timing of shareholder return to be after the
annual shareholders meeting?

A - Corporate Participant
The shareholder meeting is when the dividend for fiscal year 2012 gets decided officially.
So this is one of the milestones, but we don't believe the shareholder meeting is
something we need to hold before implementing share buyback.

Q - Masao Muraki

{BIO 3318668 <GO>}

Thank you.

A - Corporate Participant
As for, reasons for expected deterioration in auto insurance for the full year, the unit
amount of claims paid is on the upward trend and this is common in the whole industry. In
our Group, we cannot necessarily identify the specific reason for this upward trend. In
other words, it's not the case that there is a specific factor and if we eliminate it, we can
improve the situation.

Page 9 of 17



Company N ame: Sompo H oldings I nc
Company Ticker: 8630 JP Equity
Date: 2012-11-19

So we believe that this assumption that upward trend to be continued will be conservative
or appropriate view. Therefore in the second half, we expect much larger claims paid or
losses incurred year-on-year. So it may look conservative but we think it is quite sincere
assumption.

FINAL

Q - Masao Muraki

{BIO 3318668 <GO>}

Does that assumption include the forecast that there will be rush for claims request prior
to the switch to the new driver rating system?

A - Corporate Participant
In September the number of claims requests did not show any particular jump on year-onyear basis.
There are customers with policy renewals coming in October or December, so we never
know but it is not the case that we changed the forecast because there was a rush in
claims request in September.

Q - Masao Muraki

{BIO 3318668 <GO>}

Thank you, understood.

Next question is from Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley, Mr. Sasaki.

Q - Futoshi Sasaki

{BIO 17564798 <GO>}

I have two questions, first is on strategic holding stocks 127.1 billion, you said that that
amount has not changed, I wonder if that amount 127.1 billion includes the stock futures or
is it just the stocks, that's my first question. And also the gain on the short position of
stock futures where does that appear in your income statement? That's the first part of
my question.
My second question is on your dividend policy. You have the press release attached to
one of the pages in your presentation, I am a little confused. You say that the shareholder
return policy hasn't been changed, but actually you will be implementing share buyback
for the very first time, dividend amount will be reduced. So to me it seems like the policy
has been changed. So why are you doing this to begin with, could you have explain that as
a background, and could you also explain the relationship between your capital position
and changes in the divided, are they in anyway related? Thank you.

A - Corporate Participant
First regarding the reduction in strategic holding stocks, how futures are being positioned.
The priority is to sell off all of the stocks by the end of the fiscal year. So we are using
futures as a hedge to reduce the exposure in the interim. So when the stocks are sold off,
the futures on which we had held the short position would be closed after being bought
back.
Page 10 of 17



Company N ame: Sompo H oldings I nc
Company Ticker: 8630 JP Equity
Date: 2012-11-19

So as of the end of the fiscal year, all the stocks would have been sold off and the short
position on the futures would have been closed. So that will be how it looks at the end of
the fiscal year. I wonder that, if that answers your question?

Q - Futoshi Sasaki

{BIO 17564798 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes, does. Thank you. And where on the P&L statement can we see that?

A - Corporate Participant
It's included in gains on derivatives.

Q - Futoshi Sasaki

{BIO 17564798 <GO>}

I see. I think you have answered my first question.

A - Corporate Participant
Your second question on shareholder return, as for the share buyback or basically our
policy has been to maintain the stable dividend and depending on the capital position.
Execute the share buyback, we have been saying that as our policy, so it's just that we
actually acted on that policy and will be implementing the share buyback looking at the
capital position.

Bloomberg Transcript

Does that answer your question?

Q - Futoshi Sasaki

{BIO 17564798 <GO>}

Yes. So the amount of dividend being reduced, how are we to make of it? I understand
that your total return payout ratio is targeted at 50%.

A - Corporate Participant
For fiscal 2012 dividend has been reduced. Well, the share buyback is to be implemented
taking into consideration the capital position and others is what the policy says and others
part include our share price, we believe our current share price level is undervalued, so
we thought this will be a good time to act on the share buyback.
So the amount equivalent to the 20 yen reduction in dividend will be compensated for a
share buyback, going forward we'll maintain the 60 yen per share dividend at the new
level for a stable dividend payment and as for the share buyback, we will be
implementing that in a agile manner, that will be our basic policy.

Q - Futoshi Sasaki

{BIO 17564798 <GO>}

I see, thank you, I think I can ask more questions at the IR meeting.

A - Corporate Participant
Yes, I think it will be better if you raise those questions to our management.

FINAL

The next question is from Mr. Shiota of Daiwa Securities.

Q - Jun Shiota

{BIO 4127431 <GO>}

Thank you. My first question relates to one of the earlier questions, about the automotive
insurance you're expecting the incurred losses to increase. I think that is true for Sompo
Japan, whereas for Nipponkoa on the year-on-year basis, the loss ratio for automotive
insurance has actually recovered albeit slightly. Could explain the difference between the
two companies? That's my first question.
My second question again is on automotive. You said that the unit amount of claims paid is
increasing, could you elaborate on that, for example for vehicle damage, property
damage and personal injury, how the unit amount is actually increasing?

A - Corporate Participant

Bloomberg Transcript

I think our personnel from accounting can take that question.
The rate of increase in losses incurred the difference between Sompo Japan and
Nipponkoa I think is what you are referring to. With vehicle damage and property damage
as the primary factors, we do see the unit amount increasing, which is reflected in the
overall increase in unit amount.
But there is a difference between the two in recent months the Sompo Japan rate of
increase in unit price is larger slightly, and during the first half, the number of vehicles
insured increased for Sompo Japan, whereas for Nipponkoa, the number of vehicles
insured has declined and that again is reflected in the difference between the two
companies, but on a total basis between the two companies the unit amount is increasing.
Does that answer your question?

Q - Jun Shiota

{BIO 4127431 <GO>}

Yes. So do I take it, that in any event you don't know the true reason, the causes for this
rise in unit amount, is that correct?

A - Corporate Participant
For one thing it is often pointed out that with an increase in the percentage of eco-cars,
since eco-cars have many complicated parts and components the unit price of those parts
and components are higher and I think that's one factor.

Q - Wataru Otsuka

{BIO 16340098 <GO>}

I have two questions, one is on you overseas insurance business, I can't find the figures
and that's why I'm asking this question. I wonder if you have changed your forecast on
your oversees business from the original forecast to put it differently Sandy and some
other natural disasters have taken place overseas, I wonder if you have already factored
in, any of those natural disasters? That's my first question.
My second question is on automotive insurance, earlier you said that you expect the
second half to deteriorate, if that is the case could it be that in fiscal 2013 and onward you
might continue to raise premiums for automotive insurance? Those are my two questions.

Our overseas forecast, the adjusted profit forecast for fiscal 2012 is now 9.9 billion, the
original forecast was 6.3 billion, so we have revised upward by 3.6 billion, this is on the net
income basis.
And the impact of Sandy, we have yet to get all the details of the contingent business
income, so there are some uncertainties still remaining, so we don't have the overall
picture, identified, yes -- yet, but based on what we do know, most probably the damage
would be in the lower single-digit billion yen and that amount is not reflected in our
forecasted net income of 9.9 billion yen.

Q - Wataru Otsuka

{BIO 16340098 <GO>}

I see, thank you.

A - Corporate Participant
And the overseas profit forecast. We have actually adjusted upwards somewhat from the
original forecast, this is mainly in relation to our Thai subsidiary. The insured losses have
declined due to the foreign exchange factor and with more accurate estimates being
made, that's one factor.

Q - Wataru Otsuka

And regarding the loss ratio increase for automotive insurance, yes, we do expect that to
continue into next fiscal year and onward, although I didn't cover that in my presentation
today, in the new medium-term management plan that we announced today, we're
assuming that the unit amount of claims paid will continue to rise at a certain rate.

FINAL

So in that sense we do expect this to continue second half and onward, and we will be
continuing with the premiums hikes and product revisions to counter the situation.

The next question is from Ms. Tsujino of J.P. Morgan Securities.

Q - Natsumu Tsujino

{BIO 2234779 <GO>}

Thank you. My first question is about futures. I'd like to you show the breakdown of
positions currently held, with the kind of the slide that you showed for the first quarter.
The second question is about the review on Group management plan, one-time merger
cost of 120 billion yen is expected? I would like to know the timing of the recognition and
the breakdown between extraordinary losses and ordinary expenses?

A - Corporate Participant

Bloomberg Transcript

The slide for the first quarter, I am not sure what you are referring to.

Q - Natsumu Tsujino

{BIO 2234779 <GO>}

Well in other words, how much in hedge positions, of which how much is for Nipponkoa
and when the hedge was taken, that kind of table?

A - Corporate Participant
If you can take a look at page 36 of the today's material and take a look at the table on
the left. I hope this is what you are looking for, isn't it? So this is the outstanding positions
for the futures. So that means that there is not much change in positions from the first
quarter.

Q - Natsumu Tsujino

{BIO 2234779 <GO>}

So the point is there is not much change, is that correct?

A - Corporate Participant
Yes, that's correct. We have taken hedges for the whole amount planned to be sold for
the full year and we bought back the shares sold short, but at Sompo Japan we didn't do
it at the beginning for the whole amount, so we increased the amount gradually during
the year.

Q - Natsumu Tsujino

But it was increased slightly from the end of the first quarter. So you are increasing the
amount of purchase at that price, so at the current price level you are in the negative
territory, is that correct?

A - Corporate Participant

FINAL

Yes.

Q - Natsumu Tsujino

{BIO 2234779 <GO>}

Thank you.

A - Corporate Participant
And your next question is about the breakdown of one-time merger cost between
different years. As for the cost amount announced today, it was indicated in obscure
manner in the footnote of the table, we expect 24 billion yen for this fiscal year and 5
billion yen for the final year of fiscal year 2015. And part of the amount will be included in
ordinary expenses, but basically the majority will be included in extraordinary losses.
So if you subtract 24 billion yen and 5 billion yen or 29 billion yen in total from the total 120
billion yen that will leave us about 100 billion yen, this will be reflected mainly in fiscal year
2013 and '14, especially heavily in 2014, the cost breakdown between different years will
be shown with a table more accurately next week.

Bloomberg Transcript

Does that answer your question?

Q - Natsumu Tsujino

{BIO 2234779 <GO>}

So the amount for this year will be mostly in extraordinary losses, any breakdown
between Nipponkoa and Sompo Japan?

A - Corporate Participant
If I give you the total sum of the two companies, of the 24 billion yen, 19 billion yen for
extraordinary losses and 5 billion yen for ordinary expenses. And with regard to
breakdown between Sompo Japan and Nipponkoa. As for Sompo Japan, extraordinary
losses of 11 billion yen approximately and ordinary expenses 3 billion yen, and with regard
to Nipponkoa, extraordinary losses of about 8 billion yen and ordinary expenses of about
2 billion yen. Thank you.

Operator
This will be the last question from SMBC Nikko Securities. Mr. Miura please.

Q - Kazuharu Miura

{BIO 1513293 <GO>}

I have two questions on shareholder return. First is on dividend, 60 yen, if I could raise that
question again. Would it be within the range of stable dividend or do you have any
thorough calculation that you have made to justify the 60 yen? My second question is
Page 15 of 17

FINAL

what will be the assumed profit that will be the basis for the return? Does it remain
unchanged over a medium-term? I understand that your new management plan will be
explained at the next IR meeting but you have revised upward, the combined ratio for the
final year which means that you expect rather difficult situation going forward and at the
same time you are maintaining the total return payout ratio. Could you explain that?

A - Corporate Participant
Thank you. Our thinking on 60 yen dividend payment and stable dividend, if I could, I'd like
to repeat what I said earlier. For the share buyback, given the share price being
undervalued we felt that this will be the right time to execute the share buyback to an
amount that is an equivalent of 20 yen per share, meaning 8 yen billion in total.
Going forward we will maintain the stable dividend at this new level of 60 yen per share
and carry out the share buyback in the agile manner. I am afraid that's the best I can say at
my pay grade.

Q - Kazuharu Miura

{BIO 1513293 <GO>}

Thank you that really helps.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Corporate Participant
And regarding the profit which will be the basis for return, we have not changed the
assumption, the definition is as follows:we exclude the life insurance EV increase and 50%
of the adjusted, combined or consolidated profit would be the target on a medium-term
basis.
The new management plan is targeted to end at fiscal 2015 and we are expecting the
loss ratio to deteriorate and so we'll be implementing such measures as raising the
premiums, reduce cost as well as optimize the payment, but this can't be done, this can't
be completed in three years meaning that in 2016 and 2017 onward we can expect
improvement in the domestic P&C insurance.
So we believe that over medium-term we can achieve this 50% target but as you have
pointed out, the recovery in domestic P&C has been pushed back somewhat. So if you
can interpret the medium-term to mean a bit longer term, I think that you can accept this
figure of 50%.

Q - Kazuharu Miura

{BIO 1513293 <GO>}

I see thank you, that was very clear.

Operator
Thank you, this concludes the Q&A.
