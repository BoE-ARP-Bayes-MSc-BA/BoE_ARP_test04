Bulas, please begin.

Derek Bulas
Good morning, and welcome to our call to discuss Fairfax's year-end 2018 results. This call
may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ, perhaps materially,
from those contained in such forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of
uncertainties and risk factors, the most foreseeable of which are set out under Risk
Factors in our Base Shelf Prospectus, which has been filed with Canadian Securities
regulators and is available on SEDAR.

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Thank you, Derek. Good morning, Fairfax shareholders. Welcome to your company's 2018
year-end conference call. I will discuss some of the year end highlights, and then pass the
call to Dave Bonham, our Chief Financial Officer for additional financial and accounting
details.
Fairfax's net earnings were $376 million in 2018 versus $1.7 billion in 2017, which equates to
net earnings per diluted share of a $11.65 versus $64.98 in 2017. Much of this year-overyear net earnings difference relates to unrealized investment losses and the sale of First
Capital.

Bloomberg Transcript

Fairfax's book value per share in 2018 decreased by 1.5% adjusted for the $10 per share
common dividend paid in the first quarter of 2018 to $432 per share. Despite having
earnings for the year, our book value was negatively impacted by unrealized foreign
currency translation losses of $11 per share.
We experienced another year of above average catastrophes, yet our companies
continue to have very good relative results with a strong combined ratio of 97.3% across
the Group, with strong reserves and producing an underwriting profit of $318 million for
the year. All of our major insurance companies with the exception of Brit generated
combined ratios of less than 100%, with Zenith at 82.6%, Odyssey Group at 93.4%,
Northbridge at 95.8% and Allied World at 98.1%, Crum & Forster at 98%, while Brit was
105.2%.
For the year, operating income was strong at nearly $1 billion. By contrast, our net gains on
investments for the year were an unsatisfactory $253 million consisting of realized gains
on our investment portfolios of $1.2 billion principally Quess, USG, Arbor and Intrepid
offset by unrealized losses of just over $900 million, principally BlackBerry, Eurobank and
Stelco, most of which occurred in the fourth quarter. As we have mentioned that our
annual meetings and in our annual reports and quarterly calls, with IFRS accounting where
stocks and bonds are recorded at market and subject to mark-to-market gains or losses.
Quarterly and annual income will fluctuate and investment results will only make sense
over the longer term.
The turbulent markets in the final few months of 2018 wreak havoc on investment
portfolios globally. Our portfolios were similarly impacted but we fared better than many.
Much of this turbulence has reversed in the early weeks of this new year and investment
asset prices have generally risen. At Fairfax, our top 20 listed equity investments dropped
approximately $500 million in value in just the fourth quarter. But since the end of the
year, our top 20 equity positions have recouped over 50% of the decline..
Please keep in mind when you see these short-term mark-to-market gyrations, as we
have said many times in the past, our results will be lumpy as we are focused on capital
preservation in the short-term and capital gains over the long term. There are some key

FINAL

points to note for you. Strong organic growth is continuing at our companies. Our
insurance and reinsurance businesses' net written premium increased year-over-year by
8.7%, primarily due to growth at Northbridge, Odyssey, Crum & Forster and Brit after
adjusting for acquisitions and the sale of First Capital.
At the subsidiary level, the change in net premiums written for the year were as follows:
Odyssey Group was up 16.1%; Crum & Forster up 6.1%; Northbridge up 10.2%; Zenith was
down 5.8%; Brit up 9%; and Allied World up by 5.8%. In 2018, we continue to put more of
our cash to work with approximately $13 billion invested in short-term U.S. treasuries and
short-term investment-grade corporate bonds. Given the continued strength in the U.S.
economy and the perceived bias towards higher interest rates, we continue to be
focused on the short end of the treasury curve for the time being.

Bloomberg Transcript

Following this recent deployment in the short-term U.S. treasuries, we now have an annual
run rate of approximately $800 million in interest and dividend income. Subsequent to the
end of 2018, in January of this year, we invested an additional $250 million in debentures
of Seaspan, as well as $250 million in the exercise of Seaspan warrants. Upon completion
of these transactions, our cumulative cash investment in Seaspan totaled $1 billion.
In February, we completed an opportunistic offering of $85 million in senior notes due in
2024 with our partner, Mitsui Sumitomo. We continue to build on the strong trusting
relationship with MSI and see the potential for many more collaborative business ventures
in the future. Last week, the shareholders of AGT approve the management led take
private transaction. AGT as a Regina based world-leading supplier of plant-based
proteins. We welcome AGT to the Fairfax family and we look forward to collaborating with
our new partners Murad and Hussein, and their teams to continue to build our respective
agricultural businesses around the world.
Also last week, we announced the promotion of one of our key executives Peter Clark,
the Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Peter has been with Fairfax for over 20
years in various roles, such as Chief Actuary and more recently, our Chief Risk Officer.
Peter will report directly to me and will continue to work very closely with Andy Bernard
and the CEOs of our insurance and reinsurance companies.
We remain conservatively positioned and very vigilant with holding company cash and
marketable securities at over $1.5 billion. Always looking to be soundly financed first, we
have begun to repurchase our partner's interest in our insurance companies, as well as
repurchasing Fairfax shares. Since the first quarter of 2017, we have purchased over $1.1
million Fairfax shares with approximately 340,000 shares purchased in the last six weeks
alone. Our investment team at Hamblin Watsa continues to cautiously observe and
monitor events, such as the upcoming U.S. elections, Indian elections, South African
elections, the Venezuelan crisis, Brexit negotiations and ongoing negotiations on global
tariffs in particular with China.
Please remember, we continue to hold CPI-linked to deflation for contracts with a notional
amount of $114 billion and an average remaining term of maturity of 3.6 years. We carry
these contracts at only $25 million and they continue to provide us with downside

FINAL

protection in the event of a catastrophic turn of world events. With annual run rate of
approximately $16 billion in gross premium, generating strong core operating earnings
and a singular focus on underwriting discipline and superior reserving, our companies are
in a very good position to continue growing and diversifying their books of business, while
capitalizing on the potentially hardening market.
Meanwhile, the Hamblin Watsa team continues to believe there is tremendous
opportunity for Fairfax shareholders over the long term. We are keenly focused on
improving our investment performance in 2019 and we are in the process of monetizing
many of our equity investments. We believe our 15% return on equity target is very much
achievable, but please remember, as we've said before, our results will always be lumpy.
While we monetize our equities and reoptimize our portfolio, we have not reach for yield
and we made prudently invested with approximately $20 billion in cash, short-dated U.S.
treasuries and short-dated investment grade bonds, which is approximately 53% of our
portfolio investments. Given the short tenure of our fixed income portfolio, our
investment portfolios will be largely unimpacted by rising interest rates.
Now I'd like to pass the call over to Dave Bonham, our Chief Financial Officer.

Dave Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

Thank you, Paul. First of all, we wanted to let you know that in addition to the press
release that we issued yesterday, all of the details of our 2018 financial results will be
made available in our annual report, which will be posted on our website on March 8,
2019. So let's move on to Fairfax's consolidated results for the full year of 2018, hit on
some of the details of the operating company results and finished with our consolidated
financial position.
So for the full year of 2018, Fairfax has reported net earnings of $376 million or $12 per
fully diluted share and that compared to net earnings of $1.7 billion or $65 per fully diluted
share in the full year of 2017. 2018 net earnings principally reflected the strong operating
income, but with lower net investment gains compared to 2017. And remember too, that
our net earnings in 2017 also included a one-time gain of $1 billion related to the sale of
our Singapore-based subsidiary First Capital.
Our insurance and reinsurance operations produced an underwriting profit of $318 million
and a combined ratio of 97% in 2018 compared to an underwriting loss of $642 million and
a combined ratio of 107% in 2017. The increase in underwriting profit year-over-year of
$960 million, principally reflected the impact of lower current period catastrophes, since
2017 was adversely affected by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria and the 2017 California
wildfires. Net favorable prior year reserve development was also higher in 2018 on a yearover-year basis.
Current period catastrophe losses in 2018 were principally comprised of the 2018
California wildfires, specifically the Woolsey and Camp wildfires and Hurricane Michael,
which affected Florida and Southeastern United States, Typhoon Jebi, which affected
Japan and Hurricane Florence. In 2018, current period catastrophe losses totaled $752

FINAL

million representing 6.5 combined ratio points significantly lower than current period
catastrophe losses in 2017 of $1.3 billion that represented 14 combined ratio points.
Net premiums written by our insurance and reinsurance operations increased by 20% in
2018, but that principally reflected the consolidation of the full year net premiums written
by Allied World. So that was an incremental year-over-year increase of approximately $1.4
billion. In terms of our organic growth, net premiums written of the insurance and
reinsurance operations increased by 8.7%, so that's after adjusting for the acquisitions of
Allied World and the AIG branches in Latin America in Central and Eastern Europe, the sale
of First Capital last year and some other one-off intercompany reinsurance transactions.
All of these occurred either in 2017 or 2018.
So moving to our operating company results starting with Northbridge. Northbridge's
underwriting profit increased to $47 million in 2018 with a combined ratio of 96% that
compared to an underwriting profit of $9 million and a combined ratio of 99% in 2017.
Northbridge's 2018 underwriting results included the benefit of net favorable prior year
reserve development of a $107 million representing 10 combined ratio points and that
was somewhat higher than 2017 with Northbridge reported net favorable reserve
development of $94 million or 9 combined ratio points.

Bloomberg Transcript

The underwriting results of Northbridge in 2018 included $19 million of current period
catastrophe losses, principally related to storms in Ontario and Quebec. And in Canadian
dollar terms, Northbridge's net premiums written increased by 10% in 2018, reflecting
strong retention of renewal business and price increases across the Group.
Moving to Odyssey. In 2018, Odyssey Group's underwriting profit increased to a $181
million at a 93% combined ratio from an underwriting profit of $60 million at a 97%
combined ratio in 2017. Higher underwriting profit in 2018 principally reflected lower
current period catastrophe losses and higher net favorable reserve development.
Current period catastrophe losses of $252 million represented 9 combined ratio points in
2018, principally the events that I mentioned at the outset and other attritional current
period catastrophe losses. And this was lower than the current period catastrophe losses
of $392 million, which represented 17 combined ratio points for Odyssey in 2017,
principally related to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria.
Odyssey's combined ratio in 2018 also benefited from higher net favorable prior year
reserve development of $346 million or 13 combined ratio points. That development
principally related to casualty and assumed property catastrophe loss reserves. Odyssey
Group wrote $2.9 billion of net premiums in 2018 which represented an increase of 16%
from the prior year. This growth was spread across all of its divisions.
Crum & Forster. Crum & Forster's underwriting profit in 2018 increased to $33 million at a
90% combined ratio from an underwriting profit of $3 million and a combined ratio just
slightly below 100% in 2017. The increase in the underwriting profit was principally due to
higher business volumes and more profitable lines of business and lower current period
catastrophe losses, partially offset by a modest decrease in net favorable prior year

FINAL

reserve development. Crum & Forster's net premiums written increased by 6% in 2018,
primarily reflecting growth in accident and health, umbrella, commercial multi-peril
combined with the impact of rate increases.
Zenith National. Zenith National's underwriting profit in 2018 increased to $140 million at an
83% combined ratio compared to underwriting profit of a $117 million at an 86% combined
ratio in 2017. The increase in the underwriting profit in 2018 principally reflected higher net
favorable prior year reserve development and an improvement in the estimated accident
year loss ratio. Net premiums written by Zenith in 2018 of $789 million decreased by 6%
year-over-year, principally reflecting price.
Brit. In 2018, Brit reported an underwriting loss of $77 million and a combined ratio of 105%
compared to an underwriting loss of $202 million and a combined ratio of 113% in 2017.
Current period catastrophe losses of $210 million, representing 13 combined ratio points
in 2018, principally related to the main catastrophe events mentioned at the outset. That
was lower than current period catastrophe losses of $259 million or 17 combined ratio
points in 2017 that related principally to HIM.

Bloomberg Transcript

Net favorable prior year reserve development was higher in 2018 at $99 million compared
to $10 million in 2017. And Brit's net premium written increased by 9% in 2018 excluding
the onetime intercompany reinsurance transaction with Runoff that is eliminated upon
consolidation. The increase reflected the contribution from initiatives that Brit has
launched in recent years, price increases and that's partially offset by reductions in noncore lines of business through active portfolio management.
Allied World. Allied World reported an underwriting profit of $43 million and a combined
ratio of 98% in 2018 compared to an underwriting loss of $587 million and a combined
ratio of 157% during the period Fairfax owned Allied in 2017. The improvement in
underwriting profitability principally reflected lower current period catastrophe losses in
2018, which were $223 million or 10 combined ratio points. And Allied World's underwriting
profit in 2018 also benefited from $97 million or 4 combined ratio points of net favorable
prior year reserve development, which included better than expected emergence on the
2017 catastrophe losses, a reduction in unallocated loss expense reserve, partially offset
by net adverse development in its casualty and professional liability lines of business.
Allied World contributed $2.4 billion in net premiums written in 2018, compared to 200 -compared to 2017, which where Allied contributed $992 million for the period at Fairfax
owned Allied since its acquisition in July.
Fairfax Asia. Fairfax Asia's underwriting profit decreased to $400,000 at a combined ratio
of just below 100% in 2018 compared to an underwriting profit of $38 million at a
combined ratio of 88% in 2017 with the lower underwriting profit reflecting the absence in
2018 of the underwriting profit that was contributed by First Capital, which was sold in the
fourth quarter of 2017 .
The insurance and reinsurance other segment reported an underwriting loss of $49 million
and a combined ratio of 105% in 2018 compared to an underwriting loss of 81 million and
a combined ratio of 110% last year. The decrease in underwriting loss in 2018 principally

FINAL

reflected lower current period catastrophe losses, which impacted the combined ratio by
2 points in 2018 compared to 10 points in 2017.
Moving to Runoff. Runoff reported an operating loss of $198 million in 2018 compared to
an operating loss of $185 million in 2017. The increase in the operating loss in 2018
principally reflected higher net adverse development primarily related to asbestos and
other loss reserves and increases in reserves for unallocated loss adjustment expenses.
Partially offsetting this was an underwriting gain of $85 million on the Part VII transfer and
reinsurance transaction with the U.K. insurer that was disclosed in our third quarter 2018
interim report in the Runoff section.
Turning to some of the consolidated results. Consolidated interest and dividend income
increased year-over-year from $559 million in 2017 to $784 million in 2018, primarily
reflecting higher interest earned on increased holdings of short-dated U.S. treasury bonds
and high quality corporate bonds. So it's partially offset by lower interest earned on U.S.
state and municipal bonds as a result of sales during 2017 and 2018.

Bloomberg Transcript

Fairfax recorded a provision for income taxes of $44 million at a 5% effective tax rate in
2018. The lower effective tax rate in 2018 primarily reflected the gain on the
deconsolidation of Quess which was not taxable.
Our total debt to total capital ratio increased to 27.2% at December 31, 2018 from 25.8%
at December 31, 2017, and that was primarily a result of the decrease in our total capital.
We ended 2018 with an investment portfolio which included holding company cash and
investments of $38.8 billion to slightly lower than $39.3 billion that we held at December
31, 2017.
With that, I'll pass it back to you, Paul.

Hi, good morning, Junior.

FINAL

Q - Junior Ross
Two questions for you. The first question is the capitalization of investments, are we look
at the private investments or the public investment? The second question would be, are
we trying -- are we going to do aggressive buybacks this year, or is it going to follow the
same fashion that we followed last year?

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Junior, thanks for those questions. So the first one, first, we're looking to capitalize both
private and public. So we're evaluating the entire equity portfolio and re-rating it to make
sure it's our hurdle. And we're in the process as we speak of monetizing some of the
private investments and we'll look at the public investments as well. So we're always
looking to optimize. And this year, we're acutely focused on getting to that 15% return on
equity target. And so, we will be monetizing equities.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the buyback, we're very focused on as Prem said and I'm sure he'll talk about it at the
annual meeting. Over the next 10 years, buying back substantially our stock. We've started
doing that, as we mentioned, 340,000 shares in the last six weeks alone and we'll
continue to do that. But always -- Junior always being prudent and keeping that holding
company cash and marketable securities for a rainy day for safety. So, but I'll -- with that in
mind, keeping being safe. We will use excess cash to buyback our shares particularly at
these levels.

Q - Junior Ross
Okay, thanks.

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Good morning, Paul.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

A question related to that 15% ROE target. You've done a lot to improve the operating
income. I would argue that one of the levers you probably have left is on the underwriting

average, not writing lot of premiums relative to equity, so maybe you can speak around
thoughts and capacity there.

FINAL

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Yeah. So we have -- we'd certainly have capacity to grow. And we're in the right market.
We will grow substantially. In the past, Odyssey's doubled its premiums. That --we're not
seeing anything like that yet, Paul, but we are ready. And we think that particularly in the
second half of the year, we could see increasing hardening. So to the extent that
happens, we would love for our insurance companies to continue to grow. But that's what
they have. We went through the stats and for the most part, other than Zenith where
they're seeing some softening and that's what they do. They're really good at dialing it
back when they see some softening in their market. They've reduced premium, but
everybody else is growing and they will grow much more. We're sure that if there was a
hardening.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Got it. Maybe you can just give us the organic premium growth for the quarter, if you have
that number.

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Yeah, let me just grab that, it's actually about the same as the year about 8.5%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Okay, great. And then maybe one more question if I could. You haven't allocated more
capital corporate bonds in a while, sounds like you did that in Q4. Just want to get a
better understanding of that, is that because corporate spreads simply blow in the
quarter and you thought it was a good opportunity to take advantage of that? Or has your
thought around corporate credit changed on a go-forward basis?

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

No, our thoughts in corporate credit haven't changed. You're absolutely right, Paul.
Spreads did widen out, particularly the short end. And we've stayed at the very short-end,
so it's roughly equivalent to cash, but getting us that yield now, with that run rate of $800
million of interest and dividend income. So we took advantage of opportunistically in the
end of the last quarter of the year. And that's what we're best at. We will take advantage
when it comes. But for now, we are very focused on staying at the short-end of the curve.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

That's great. Thank you.

Hi, there, good morning, everyone.

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

FINAL

Good morning.

Q - Jeff Fenwick

{BIO 15350794 <GO>}

Paul, just a follow-up on the equity position monetization efforts that you got going on
there. How should we think about that in terms of your view of just relative weighting of
equities within the portfolio there? I mean are you talking about taking that weighting
lower, or is this just a bit of a repositioning we're talking about?

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

I think it's just more of a recall or repositioning optimizing is what we're focused on, Jeff.
So there's some things just that makes sense, given the price we think we can get for
them to move them out. And others that just came in, like Toys "R" Us just came in, and
there is some work that they need to do to optimize their operations. But for us, we're
looking at selling things that will go at a good price. And right now, private equity is a focus
in the marketplace. Number of people want those assets, and so we'll look to sell into
that.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jeff Fenwick

{BIO 15350794 <GO>}

I mean, I guess, one follow on, the other one obviously very large position now at
Seaspan. I mean, can you just clarify for us, is there anything in that agreement about
holding that position or being able to sell it down at any period of time in the near future?
Or how should we think about how you're going to manage that going forward?

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Yeah, so that, as you know, we really like David Sokol, and he is one of the best managers
we think we've ever seen. And he's got Bing Chen as CEO, but David is intimately
involved. And we think that's a good long-term hold. Obviously, everybody is focused on
short-term and trade with China, but long-term having that kind of a business with David
Sokol at the top, we think is something that can do very well. He has already been out
there buying assets on the cheap and building up that business. And so for us, yes, so to
answer your question, there's no need for us to hold. I mean it's available for sale, but this
is when we think we could hold for a very long time. It's got a lot of runway with David and
we could see great things from it. So we think it's one that's going to make us a lot of
money over the long term.

Q - Jeff Fenwick

{BIO 15350794 <GO>}

Good morning.

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

In the news last week or a couple of weeks ago, Fairfax rumored for to be looking at
Protective Insurance. Not looking necessarily for you to comment on that rumor. But just in
terms of M&A transactions in the insurance and reinsurance space, is there still an
appetite to go down that path? Is there anything in particular that you would like to add or
brief up, maybe some commentary around M&A in that space?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Yeah. So for us, that's a great question. We do get quite a lot. After we completed the
acquisition of Allied World, we really do feel like we've done a big acquisitions we need to
do. And to the prior question, we really think the thing to be focused on now is buying
back our own stock. But that said, we do see specialty businesses more tuck-in things that
we're looking at from time to time and we'll continue to do those. They are brought to us
sometimes from our own companies. We've got, as you know, a fairly good reputation of
treating entrepreneurs, owner very well and they want to bring their businesses to us. And
if they make sense, we'll look at them, but they're more tuck-in type acquisitions.
On Protective, typically we don't talk about acquisitions until we've actually completed
them, but that's one that, I would say, that we did receive the call and we -- just to say,
because there is rumors about us being there that we are in fact not there and we will not
be there. We're not interested. And we typically don't comment, but that's one just

not looking at Protective in anyway.

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

Okay. And then, maybe a little bit more granular question around the corporate and
overhead. Is there anything that happened in the quarter that drove a little bit higher
corporate overhead expenses that would be maybe one-time or something that you can
point to?

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

There will be -- thanks for the question. There will be some more details on that in our
interim report. There was a little bit of -- there was a reclassification in one of our
operating companies of about $11 million of underwriting expenses that really weren't
underwriting expenses. They were more related to a startup operation. So I think you
might be seeing that in the fourth quarter corporate overhead.

Good morning, Tom.

Bloomberg Transcript

With respect to the investment portfolio. It sounds like you're not changing your
concentration or proportion of assets that you have in equities, just perhaps some more
buying and selling in the portfolio kind of a reshuffling of holdings. Do I have this
characterization of your monetization correct here?

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Yeah, that's right, Tom. I mean, we think the team Wade and Lawrence and Prem and
Roger that the team is salivating a little bit. It's a stock pickers market. There's things that
we can invest in around the world. But you're absolutely right. We're looking primarily to
optimize, it's not going to be a change in the mix.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay. And -- or no change in the percentage of your portfolio that's in equities.

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

No.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay. And then, with respect to the cash deployment, down considerably year-over-year
and quarter-over-quarter, is there a kind of a magical percentage of your portfolio that
you'd like to be in cash. And if you're just deploying it in the short-term stuff that seems
just to be very temporary, where would you like to put it? Where would you like to deploy
this money in the long run to try to hit your hurdle, because this is being so much in cash
isn't helping, because it doesn't sound like given the concentration, given your -- what you

Page 12 of 22



Company N ame: Fairfax Financial H oldings L td

said about equity that you don't want to increase the equity position substantially, so
where do you want to put this money?

FINAL

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

So I mean, longer term, Tom, we'd like to go into longer-term fixed income, but we won't
do it at the expense of quality or tenant, right. So we're thinking that over the near to midterm here that the rates will rise and we just don't want to take any risk. So we're staying
short end of the curve, but we're finding yield there. And where -- I said we're at about
$800 million of interest and dividend income run rate. We think maybe a $1 billion
achievable may be in that range on a run rate basis, but we will not reach for yield. And so,
we're just sticking conservatively at the short-end of the curve.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

Good afternoon from Sweden.

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Hi, good afternoon, good morning.

Q - Daniel Chan

{BIO 16137349 <GO>}

Hi. I was wondering regarding the share buybucks from fourth quarter, so that you
repurchased 150,000 shares at a cost of $20.4 million, and that seems to be around $135
per share, which sounds very cheap. Is that correct?

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

No, I don't think so. Dave?

A - Dave Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

Yeah, the share buyback in the fourth quarter was 52,000 shares at a cost of $22 million
and that's about $434 per share. And then, we also did some buybacks for treasury about
98,000 shares at a cost of $44 million, that's about $451 per share. So our buybacks are
coming in between $430 and $450 per share in the fourth quarter.

Q - Daniel Chan

Q - Daniel Chan

{BIO 16137349 <GO>}

You are also writing that there were some amortization of some $109.3 million regarding
the subsidiary holdings intangible assets. Would you possibly provide some light regarding
those write-offs or amortization?

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

So that amortization related to intangible asset amortization. So when we make an
acquisition, part of the access that we pay over the fair value what or the carrying value
what we acquire is either goodwill or intangible assets and a lot of what you're seeing
there is amortization of customer relationships, broker relationships things like that, that
were made in prior acquisitions relating to Zenith and Allied, especially Allied. More
recently, that's kind of the big change period-over-period.

A - Dave Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

All right. But they're all according to plan I'd say.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Yeah, there is no impairments or anything in there, it's just normal course amortization.
and I would just highlight on the corporate overhead. The other factor there that is -- that
has made it increase in the quarter is just lower share of profit of associates. So we had
some profit of associate related to Eurolife last year, and it wasn't as high this year. So
that's the other factor.

Q - Daniel Chan

Next question from Mark Dwelle, RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Yeah, good morning. A couple of questions. First, related to the Runoff unit. I mean, I see
the loss in the quarter was around $96 million. I know you had the gain related to the
transaction that you did, so was there a substantial reserve addition or something else in
the quarter that kind of accounts -- squares those differences?

A - Paul Rivett

Page 14 of 22



Company N ame: Fairfax Financial H oldings L td
Company Ticker: FFH CN Equity
Date: 2019-02-15

Yeah, we had some adverse development that I mentioned in my comments there, $200
million or so, and that was on asbestos, other reserves, unallocated loss adjustment
expenses and there was a little bit of an offset in there for some favorable development
on workers' compensation business.

FINAL

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

And that was all in the quarter, not for the full year?

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

That was mostly in the quarter. That's right.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Okay. The second question I had, within Brit, there was a fairly substantial decline in the
net written premiums. You also mentioned there that there was an intercompany
transaction. Could you just square how large that was, so that I can kind of get what the
kind of the underlying run rate on the business was in the quarter?

A - Dave Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. So the intercompany transaction that I referred to there was a reinsurance into
Advent and the amount of the ceded premium or the amount that was affected, the net
written premium was about a $174 million. So that's the adjustment you make to Brit to get
to the 9% growth rate that we set that Paul and I had mentioned in our comments.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Got it, thank you. And then the last question that I had related to, I guess, it primarily
relates to the California fires. We've been seeing this stuff about the PG&E bankruptcy
and the considerable insurance liabilities that they've incurred. Just Fairfax have any
particular exposure to that?

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

We have just a little bit approximately $25 million, Mark.

Q - Howard Slinker
Thank you. Maybe I didn't hear you clearly. Could you please explain why Brit became so
much after you bought it from Apollo?

FINAL

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Well, I don't think -- Howard, I don't think it actually decayed that much. I mean it's -they've been hit more than our other companies with the catastrophe losses. I think is the
primary thing that's happened to them, but Dave, I don't know if you want to add to that.

A - Dave Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

Yeah, I think that's fair enough. And if you're looking at the net premium written, as we
talked about in 2018, it needs to be adjusted a little bit for that reinsurance transaction.

Q - Howard Slinker
But even if you take out the cat losses, the return on total capital would still be single
digits, which is not what you believed, at least according to the prospectus of the deal
when you bought Brit. So what's the difference?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

No, I think, Howard it's primarily catastrophes. I mean, the Lloyd's market has gotten
tougher. And so, there is a rebalancing happening in Lloyd's, we think over the long term,
Brit's one of the companies that's going to benefit from that. But the other thing quite
frankly as we've underperformed on investments, Howard. So we need to do better on
that. But Brit with the team led by Matthew is doing very well and they will take advantage
of what's happening in the Lloyd's market. So and -- but we need to do better on
investments for them.

Q - Howard Slinker
Well, I'm curious, because what else would you say, but doing very well. When I looked at
the transaction, I came up with different numbers than you came up with, and maybe their
management is not as sharp as you originally estimated.

A - Paul Rivett

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

Yeah, just wanted to quicky follow-up on the favorable reserve development in this
quarter. Is -- was there anything in particular that was driving that, whether it's from the
catastrophe losses from 2017? Is it a -- is it something that we can potentially read into
maybe you're a little more conservative around catastrophe losses and this is something
that can repeat in future years? And then a quick comment around the 2018 reserve
development just being higher than your sort of longer run average run rate.

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Yeah, so I can hit the first one. We saw about $200 million of reserve redundancies from
the cats from 2017. So that's one. Generally speaking, we have been very good over the
last 10 years at conservatively reserving and have had reserve redundancies for the last 10
years. But with respect to the catastrophes in '17, that's led to about $200 million of
release. All right. Any other questions?

Very good, thanks.

FINAL

Q - Andrew Hollingworth

{BIO 1896571 <GO>}

Great. Just one question from me. On the assets out of the balance sheet, when you
talked after the question earlier on, you talked about the amount that's in equities and the
amount that was in bonds and cash. While it's not prescribed, is that sort of break down
something that you choosing to do in the very long-term to sort of match the liability side
of the balance sheet?
And the reason I ask is, obviously, maybe a little bit more value was offered in terms of
short-term corporate bonds in the fourth quarter, but mentioned quite a lot of value was
on offering longer term assets, like sort of high-quality equities and you obviously didn't
deploy in today. So just help me understand whether it's sort of the balance sheet
structure we've got on the asset side is something that's slightly prescribed from the
liability choice that you're making.

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

No, that was the choice we are making with respect to the equities that we held. I mean,
roughly speaking, we're going to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 25% to 30% in
equities generally and we added to the equities that we have. As I mentioned, we're
adding now to Seaspan. You might have seen, we did a transaction with Grivalia and
Eurobank that we think will do very well. But we're roughly in the zone where we want to
be with respect to equities.

Q - Andrew Hollingworth

{BIO 1896571 <GO>}

Okay. And if you wanted have a bigger percentage, you could. It's a choice you've made
in terms of the asset blend you want to have in the business?

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

We're roughly at the upper end of our limit with respect to exposure, given the rules and
regulations and that each of the regulators have in the insurance and reinsurance
companies that we operate. So we're roughly at the top end of that range, Andrew.

Q - Mikel Abasolo

{BIO 3756596 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes, hello, good morning. Thank you for taking my question, Paul. And if I may, with my
question I would like to challenge a little your equity portfolio positioning and the fact that
you're aiming to reposition the equity side and the equity position in the asset side. From
what I see you have roughly $10 billion in equities on the asset side against $11.8 billion of
shareholders' equity. So those two are related, it seems like as you just said, in the upper
range of what is allowable from a regulatory perspective.
But my question is, and I know we've been shareholders of Fairfax for a long time, and I
know what you've been through with hedging the equity portfolio in previous years. And -but my worry is that perhaps you're going long equities and I'm not questioning your -the Seaspan peak or that other peak. But in terms of asset allocation, aren't you too
exposed to equities now, precisely now when there seems to be on alternative for your
float in the U.S. short-term fixed income market.
And precisely now when it seems that equities over the long run, and if you look at the
indices or the asset categories, the U.S. equities can only go down. And my worry here is
that if U.S. equities go to fair value, that would be easily 50% down from where they're
trading today and that would wipe out 50% of your equity capital. Wouldn't it be prudent
precisely now to go back to where you were in 2013, 2014 hedge at least a portion of
your equity portfolio.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Yeah, so -- I mean, that's a good question. And I think from our perspective, if you look at
our results longer term, we've done well. These short-term things that you tend to be
focused on, you saw what happened in the fourth quarter and you saw the rebound. It is
we think a stock pickers market. But we've got value stocks that we don't think will go
down as much as the broader market and we don't really want to do the type of hedging
we've done in the past, but yet we're conservatively positioned with so much in cash and
short-term fixed income.
So, yes, the worry out there, what you're saying and work contrarian a little bit, Mikel. So
we do like the stocks we have and we do think that it is a stock pickers market and we do
think that relative to our peers that are assets are conservatively positioned, because we
have so much in cash and short-term fixed income and the equity is our value equities that
we believe. And that we believe we will withstand these kind of -- this volatility in this
period. And meanwhile, while we're sitting conservatively positioned, we do think there's
a high potential for a trade deal that will extend the runway in the U.S. and could
potentially lead to the markets moving up for some period of time.

Q - Mikel Abasolo

{BIO 3756596 <GO>}

Yes. Paul, just to clarify. When you said your conservative position because of the cash and
your short-term bonds that you have. I mean, but that needs to be that way for, because
of the liabilities that you have in your insurance operation, right. So what I'm saying is, I'm
not doing a mistake by dividing the balance sheet between -- on the asset side, I would
have cash and short-term. On the liability side, I would have the liabilities of your insurance

Page 19 of 22



Company N ame: Fairfax Financial H oldings L td

Date: 2019-02-15

FINAL

and reinsurance operations. And then another separation another classification of your
balance sheet would be I take your equities against your shareholders equity on the
liability side.
So I don't gain much confirm from the fact that that you have plenty of cash in short-term
treasuries or corporate bonds, because that is the default choice, since you're on
insurance operation, right. So the equity exposure, and by the way, I like your stock picks
as well, because I like you guys as value investors. But my worry is that if the market goes
down 50% and it stays there, where it's ought to be trading for a long time that your
solvency would be at risk and the whole thing would be at risk. That's like a big question I
have.
And I don't get from your answer a relief of that, because as I see, you have $10 billion -$10.3 billion in equities, that -- and I'm sure that Seaspan will do great and I'm sure that
Euro Bank will raise eventually and so on, but if the market goes down 50%, I don't see a
way for those stock positions to really bifurcate or divert from the market to that extent,
you see. That would hit your equity.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

I understand what you are saying, Mikel. And I think this is something probably better dealt
with at the Annual General Meeting and Prem will address it. You'll have the chance to
speak with all of our professionals, Wade and Lawrence and Roger. And they'll talk about
it there. But I think we don't match assets and liabilities. And for us, we start in the fourth
quarter was a nice test. Our stocks didn't go down as much as many as did. We do think
that we're positioned conservatively with those stocks. And if there is something
catastrophic like a 50% down, there aren't too many companies like us that have $114
billion in things like credit deflation floors.
So we are positioned with things that we have on our balance sheet that we think will give
us some lift, if there is something catastrophic like that, but then the other side of it is that
in this market that we're -- it's a stock pickers market. We're looking at things and we're
trying to do debt and warrants, and debt and warrants deals that will give us protection
that others aren't getting. And we're having management that wants us to do those
deals, unlike Seaspan where we can get the protection, get the yield and still have equity
upside. So we think we're being prudent. But I think your question is a good one. And I'm
sure we will come up at the AGM and that's probably the best place to deal with it.

going to put more money in?

A - Paul Rivett

{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Yeah, no, it's turned out to be better than we expected in some ways and tough in others.
So we bought it and basically, we're able to buy it for real estate value and in turns out
that as we've looked the real estate. In fact, the real estate was worth more than even
our purchase price. So we got a business that was making over 10 years, $100 million of
EBITDA year after year after year, basically for free. And 5,000 employees in 80 locations
across the country and the Number 1 toy seller.

Bloomberg Transcript

And as you've seen, I mean, retail, particularly through the Christmas season wasn't the
greatest. But the company continues to generate EBITDA and with the team that we've
got in retail, we're going to do very well. But it's a classic value investment and that we
were able to purchase with all kinds of downside protection, got the real estate basically
on the cheap and then got the business for free. And that's the type of deal we will do
every time we see it, so it's been a good one for us.
