Good day and welcome to The Travelers Companies' Conference Call and Webcast. All
participants will be in listen-only mode. After today's presentation, there will be an
opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President
Investor Relations. The floor is yours.

Gabriella Nawi

{BIO 2211991 <GO>}

Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us today on such short notice. By
now, you have seen our announcement detailing our succession plan. And while we didn't
need to arrange for a call, you all know us well enough to know that we're open in our
communication to the Street, and so, it felt appropriate for you to hear directly from Jay
Fishman, Alan Schnitzer and Brian MacLean. After they speak, we'll give you the
opportunity to ask a few questions, although we will keep it brief.
And now, Jay Fishman.

Jay Steven Fishman

{BIO 1933251 <GO>}

Thank you, Gaby. Well, good afternoon everybody and thank you for joining us today. As
you know, we prepare for these calls with a fair amount of diligence. But to go off-piste
for a second, Alan Schnitzer taught me a while ago that the day breaks down into two

portions: There's the caffeine portion and the alcohol portion. And I'm sitting here with a
glass of wine and we are well into the alcohol portion here. So, off and running.
Look, by now, I'm sure you've all read the announcement that went out earlier regarding
our leadership changes. Effective December 1, Alan is going to succeed me as our Chief
Executive Officer, and he will also be elected to Travelers' Board of Directors at that date.
Following his assumption of the CEO role, I will remain Executive Chairman. Alan is a
terrific business person, and all of Travelers' constituents are going to benefit from his
thoughtful judgment, his keen intellect and his leadership skill.
As for me, as I said, my plan is to remain with the company as Executive Chairman for the
foreseeable future. I love this company and for me, there's no better way to spend my
time productively and with great satisfaction. I assure you this will not be an absentee role.
I will be on-site, continuing to do the things I believe add real value, participating as a
member of the senior management team, and providing guidance and assistance as the
company begins this next chapter.

Some of you may be wondering why now and why today? Specifically, I'd like to assure
everyone that there has been no recent change in my health. And I would guess that
those who have seen me in the last several weeks will attest to my energy, focus and
great continued passion for all that is Travelers.
Since I learned that I was dealing with something more serious than a bad back, I've been
regularly discussing my circumstance with our board of directors and have continued to
focus on organizational succession with the same detail and seriousness that we always
have. Nothing about my health changed, either the board's view or my own view of our
obligation to handle succession in a thoughtful responsible way.
I will be 63 in November, so even absent any health issue, this was the topic that was
getting regular attention by me and by our board.
More recently, I've spoken with our lead director on several occasions about the timing of
the transition, and we determined that a regularly scheduled meeting of the board of
directors in person was the right place to finalize and take the actions necessary to begin
succession. That conversation occurred earlier today, and the board has taken the actions
that I've discussed with them for some time.
We decided to host this call to demonstrate the thoughtfulness and serious intention that
this most critical matter has received by all of us. We all thought it important to make the
announcement while I was still able to do the job at my own standards and that it would
be apparent to all of our constituents that we have planned this thoughtfully and not in
response to an unanticipated event.
I've spoken before of just how much pride I have in what this organization has
accomplished, and I couldn't have any greater pride in our track record than I do today. I
have also joked many times that underwriters become damaged with age, that eventually,
there's just no risk left you'll write. And I recognized that over all these years, I've

accumulated a little of that underwriting scar tissue myself, and so one of the great joys of
succession is that someone else with a little less scar tissue can see the world in a little
more opportunistic way. Alan will bring that to this job and it is a perspective that will be
very helpful. Importantly, there's enough infrastructure and culture embedded here to
make sure that we don't forget some of the painful lessons we've learned in the past.
Alan really is a leader of extraordinary talent and judgment and versatility and heart. He
has earned a respect of our board, our people, our agent and brokers and for his deep
understanding of our business, his keen insight and his very strong leadership. Alan is the
ideal executive to lead Travelers in its next chapter, and I am really proud to continue
working alongside him and the rest of our outstanding senior management team.
And with that, let me turn it over to Brian.

Brian William MacLean

{BIO 4679150 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks, Jay. So Jay spoke of the love and the pride he has in what this organization is and
what it's accomplished. I can assure you that I and many others share that same affection
and sense of pride.
For over a decade, I, along with Jay Benet, Bill Heyman, Doreen Spadorcia and many
others have had the great privilege of working under Jay's direction. Over that same time
period, we've been working with Alan and for the last eight years directly alongside him
here at Travelers. Together, we've all helped build this company into something special,
and I believe the stability and comradery of this group has played a meaningful part in
making us who we are today.
As Jay said, he's been very transparent in this process. All along, Jay has been open with
us, his partners, as well as the board of directors. We've all been with the company a very
long time and we understand the importance of continuity and ensuring a smooth
succession plan. The transition of the CEO responsibilities is obviously a critical step in that
plan, and I know that Alan is the right person for the job. We've all benefited greatly from
his insight, his judgment and strategic thinking, and we are confident that he will do a
fabulous job leading this organization. We, and in this regard I'm speaking for myself, Jay
Benet, Bill Heyman and Doreen Spadorcia, are all deeply invested in this company, both
financially and personally, and we're all committed to its continued success.
We are all enthusiastically looking forward to continuing in our roles and working together
as a team with Alan to position this company for the future. Completing this succession
process is critical for the company, and we're all really excited about being a part of it.
And with that, let me turn it over to Alan.

Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Thank you, Brian, and thank you, Jay, and good afternoon everyone. Thanks for joining on
such short notice. In response to Brian's comments, I'd point out that among Brian, Jay

FINAL

Benet, Bill Heyman and Doreen, the shortest tenure among them at Travelers is 23 years.
And together, they have more than 100 years at Travelers. They're the best in the
business at what they do, and I'm grateful for their partnership.
This call is obviously not the usual quarterly earnings call and probably not typical for this
circumstance. But as Gaby pointed out in her introduction, we decided to host the call in
the interest of being open and accessible. To that end, I'd like to take just a minute to tell
you a little about what you can expect going forward.
But before I do that, I can't help but say a few words about Jay. As you've heard, he's not
going anywhere. So it's not time to reflect on his career but just a quick comment.
Travelers today is stronger than ever and I mean that in every which way; culturally,
financially, our position in the marketplace and so on. And in no small measure, that
success is due to Jay's outstanding leadership. Jay, of course, will dispute that and he'll
mean it. He'll say it's an ensemble cast. We don't have any stars, and he's sort of right
about that. The depth and breadth, experience and expertise of the talents around here
is world class and probably our single biggest competitive advantage.

Bloomberg Transcript

But that doesn't take away from the fact that Jay's leadership, which is clearly born out of
his deep love for the business and this company, has been remarkable. I could recite the
litany of Jay's great accomplishments. But, Jay, I just wanted to take a minute to thank you
publically for your extraordinary leadership of this company. No one is more pleased than I
am that you're going to stick around, that you're not going anywhere.
With that, let me get back to what you can expect going forward. For the most part, you
can expect business as usual. One of the great benefits of running a company within an
ensemble cast is that the strategy is not when it's been imposed top-down. It's
institutional. A return focused strategy, which starts with meaningful competitive
advantages, which are highly valued by our agents, brokers and customers, and
everything about the way we've executed on that strategy, has been developed and
executed by team over many years. I and the rest of the senior team fully subscribe to it.
It's not Jay's strategy; it's our strategy.
That's not to say that we don't challenge ourselves on a regular basis to make sure that
the strategy and the way we're executing on it remains relevant. In a world the
marketplace that's always changing, it's critical to reassess all the time. That's just part of
the program around here.
So what can you expect? We remain committed to being open and accessible to all of
you, to delivering superior returns over time for our shareholders, to delivering industryleading products and services to our agents, brokers and customers and to making sure
this is a great place to work for the best talent in the industry. I couldn't feel better about
the trajectory that we're on or our ability to continue to deliver.
And with that, let me open it up for a few questions.

Q&A
Operator

FINAL

Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question we
have will come from Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please go ahead.

Q - Jay H. Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Jay, I just want to congratulate you and your fantastic track record as CEO and also thank
you for your leadership. Job well done.

A - Jay Steven Fishman

{BIO 1933251 <GO>}

Well, Jay, that's so nice of you to say. One of the great joys of being in this job for as long
as I've been is that I get to work with so many of you for an extended period of time and
get to know you a little bit and know how you look at the industry. And you're just a topnotch guy, and appreciate always your engagement with us, the questions you ask. Thank
you for the comment, and I'm just pleased to continue to be a part of the place.

Q - Jay H. Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Great to hear. Best of luck to you too, Alan.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks, Jay.

Operator
Next we have Paul Newsome of Sandler O'Neill.

Q - Paul Newsome

{BIO 1541286 <GO>}

I too want to give my absolute congratulations to you, Jay. I think the other Jay is right, it's
been a wonderful track record, and it's been great to watch it from the outside. And Alan,
congratulations, you're getting a big seat. And Jay, this is a little bit personal but my father
has ALS. So, I have a little bit of sense of what you're going through. And I know the
community here and personally, our hearts and thoughts are with you and we hope that
the progression is very slow and you're around for a very long time.

A - Jay Steven Fishman

{BIO 1933251 <GO>}

Thank you, Paul. I'm sorry for your family's aggravation. I just decided early on. Once you
get over the dynamic of how horrible it is, you get to, okay, how we – what are we going
to do today? What are we going to do today and how are we going to make it a good
day? And that's just the approach I've taken and at least so far so good.
I'm blessed that I've been able to be supported by a remarkable place around here, work
– someone – I'll wax personally for a second – someone anonymously sent a note that

said, gee, why don't you want to be with your family and why do you want to even
continue doing this? And as I reflected on it, this is my family. It's not my only family, but it's
a real important part of it. And it's where I've spent most of the hours for the last 20-odd
years and made good friends. And it's just been spectacular. Where else would I want to
spend that time? It's just this is the right place for me. So again, I'm sorry for your family's
aggravation and please send my regards to your father. I hope he continues to do well
and be safe.

Q - Paul Newsome

{BIO 1541286 <GO>}

Well, thank you very much. And as I know that – from my own studies of this, the mind
stays sharp throughout the whole process. So, I'm sure that Travelers will continue to
benefit from that. I actually have a real question. I mean as you think about your transition,
as the group transitions, do you think this – what should we expect as the team changes
and it falls over time? Maybe Alan has some thoughts on that.

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. I'll take that and then I'll go back to my prepared remarks. This really is an
institutional strategy that we have and we've been executing on. And it's not off the
moment, it's over many years and it's been thought through, it's evolved, it continues to
evolve. And it will change, but it would have changed anyway, right? It would have
changed because the marketplace changes, the world changes and we'll continue to be
at the forefront of that, and we'll be bold and creative and thoughtful. And we'll take on
the challenges of the marketplace in all the ways you'd expect a great leadership team to
do that.

A - Jay Steven Fishman

{BIO 1933251 <GO>}

Paul, I've encouraged Alan it's – and it's a line we use in our annual report, but it's genuine:
What's critical is to be relevant not reverent. I'll give full credit to George Balanchine for
that. But just because somethings been the right course of action for the past 10 years,
doesn't relieve us of the responsibility to challenge how to be successful over the next 10
years. It should never be a passive strategy but an active one. After looking at all the
opportunities and the marketplace circumstances, we should come to the conclusion of
the best way to create shareholder value.
We started on this mission in 2004 when a group of us got together and asked a very
basic question, why should someone own our stock? And that's a question that changes
from time-to-time. The answer changes. Question's always the same; the answer
changes. And I've just encouraged Alan and the rest of the team here to continue to
challenge the assumptions and make sure that we're being as thoughtful as we can to
build shareholder value.

A - Brian William MacLean

{BIO 4679150 <GO>}

Paul, this is Brian. I'm just going to chime in with some thoughts. And I've been here a
really long time. As I said in my comments, I think it's a special place and a big part of that
is the commitment that the leadership team has here. And I think Jay Benet's the best
CFO in the industry. I think Bill Heyman's the best CIO in the business. Doreen is the best

operator I've ever seen and humbles me every day in watching her drive change and
advance this organization. And I can tell you, we're all excited. You can read the proxy and
you can find our ages, and we're not all going to be here forever. But we are
enthusiastically here today and embracing the roles and looking forward to continuing to
work with Jay and looking forward to being led by Alan into the next era of this company.
So I can assure you, an excited team.

Q - Paul Newsome

{BIO 1541286 <GO>}

Thank you. Fantastic. Congratulations on succession, well done.

A - Jay Steven Fishman

{BIO 1933251 <GO>}

Thank you, Paul.

A - Gabriella Nawi

{BIO 2211991 <GO>}

Thank you. Next question please.

Operator
Yes, ma'am. It comes from Sarah DeWitt of JPMorgan.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Sarah E. DeWitt

{BIO 18946247 <GO>}

Hi. I'd also like to reiterate, Jay, congratulations on a great job over the years. And Alan,
congratulations as well on your new role. I just wanted to ask a question on the earnings
call, it sounded like you were interested in large acquisitions. But now with a new CEO,
does that change your approach at all to a large scale M&A?

A - Jay Steven Fishman

{BIO 1933251 <GO>}

I should defer to my CEO here and ask him to answer the question. But I'd make this
observation. I think there was a almost an overreaction to a question that we answered on
that earnings call. The answer was actually no different than it's ever been, which is I've
always said, we look at anything and everything. And if there's a rumor around that we're
looking at it, it's probably a good assumption that we are. We think of ourselves as having
a terrific M&A skill base. We've demonstrated that. That's not observational; it's
substantive. It's based upon transactions done and successfully integrated best in the
industry.
And so, our orientation has always been to view them as opportunistic and see if we can
add value. But I've also always said, we've always said, the bar is pretty high and in the
sense that we do believe that returns matter. And we are the highest returning company
in the industry, and you got to pay a premium for someone else. It gets tough to make
sense of it. So we couldn't care less about being bigger for bigger sake. We'd like to be
bigger if it changes either our growth trajectory or our return opportunity or the return
volatility gets lower.

Page 7 of 9



Company N ame: Travelers Cos I nc/The
Company Ticker: TRV US Equity
Date: 2015-08-04

But just to do a transaction to do a transaction – way too much risk with our shareholders'
money, and I got to make sense out of it and let everyone understand why it makes
sense. And so there's not all that much change, but it's certainly in the environment that
we're in now – got a lot more coverage than I had contemplated it would.

FINAL

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah, Sarah, I'll just add that I think Jay has given you the same answer he's given you for
a long time, and that's the same answer everybody should expect going forward. Our
shareholders should demand that we know what's available in the marketplace. They
should demand that we know what might be available, what would add value to our
shareholders. And we will continue to work hard at that. When there's a transaction out
there and we think it contributes to a great shareholder value, we'll make every effort to
get it done.

Q - Sarah E. DeWitt

{BIO 18946247 <GO>}

Great. Thank you and best of luck.

Yes, ma'am. And that'll come from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Well, first is thank you very much for the call. And Jay, it's good to hear you in such a high
spirit, in such a historical day for both of the company as well for the industry. You've been
wonderful for all the stakeholders over the years. Thank you very much.

A - Jay Steven Fishman

{BIO 1933251 <GO>}

Well, thank you, Kai. Honest to God, it's been a privilege, and I've been fortunate to have
been in the right place at the right time is honestly how I feel about it. So, thank you for
your comment.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Yeah. Alan, congratulations and you're inheriting a great franchise. I just want to see if you
have some initial thought to see what area you will be focusing on for further
Page 8 of 9

improvements of the franchise to make the brand to even higher level from here. That's a
pretty high bar.

FINAL

A - Alan D. Schnitzer

{BIO 3529437 <GO>}

Yeah. Kai, thanks for that. The announcement is just out. It's a little early to start making
strategic pronouncements. We'll continue to execute on the strategy. It'll largely be
business as usual, and we'll look for all the opportunities to create shareholder value and
do it better going forward. But it's a little early to get into specifics.
