{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Thanks, Rick, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today.
Last night AXIS reported second quarter operating income of $173 million or $1.63 per
diluted share, annualized operating earnings – sorry – annualized operating ROE of 13.1%.
We ended the quarter with diluted book value per share of $49.69 an increase of 5%
during the quarter. Adjusted for dividends, diluted book value grew 6% during the quarter
and 19% over the last year.
In addition, we returned $170 million in capital to our shareholders through share
repurchases and common share dividends. And for the year-to-date that number is $377
million.
Earnings are up substantially from last year's second quarter. On a comparative basis, this
year's quarter had more modest impact from catastrophes, higher favorable reserve
development, and stronger results from our alternative investments.

FINAL

Overall, we reported a solid combined ratio of 90.8% including 3.6 points for cats and 8.5
points of favorable prior-year development. A good portion of which relates to releases
for claims set up for last year's cat and weather, another indication of our prudence in
establishing initial reserve levels.
The ex-cat combined ratio is higher this year. Part of this is driven by higher U.S. property
losses consistent with the experience you've heard discussed on other earnings calls. A
portion is due to our earning out of the unearned premium reserves on an unprofitable
subset of the U.S. D&O book as we discussed on our February call.
I am pleased to report that we're making very good progress on the improvement plans
on this portfolio and we should see improvements running through our results in the
second half of the year and into 2015.
The rest of the increase in the non-cat combined ratio is due to a continued deliberate
shift to less volatile and non-correlating lines of business that tend to generate higher
combined ratios with good ROEs given generally lower capital needs.

Bloomberg Transcript

We made strong progress across many of our initiatives during the quarter. Our reentry
into the U.S. primary casualty business is gaining traction. We started quoting and binding
business and our new medical malpractice units set up earlier this year and our new
Lloyd's Syndicate is also providing opportunities for new business that we did not see
previously.
But perhaps the most newsworthy is that this quarter our accident and health business
generated a positive contribution for the first time. Now, I expect that there will be slightly
above or below breakeven for a couple more quarters but our team keeps doing an
excellent job of bringing on significant new business, increasing its share of existing client
business, and improving the balance between insurance and reinsurance and between
U.S. and international. And continuing to build what I expect will be a large and profitable
book of business for AXIS.
We also continue to make progress on analytics and expense control initiatives that will
drive improvements in results independent of the vagaries of the P&C cycle. I will discuss
these targeted gains and market conditions in more detail after Joe covers our quarterly
results. Joe?

Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Thank you, Albert, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter we generated good
results with an annualized operating ROE of 13.1%. Our quarterly diluted book value per
common share, a key metric in measuring the value we generate for our shareholders
increased by 5% in the quarter and by well in excess of 16% over the last 12 months.
Adjusting for common and dividends declared the increase was 6% for the quarter and
19% for the past 12 months. Our results benefited from a reduction in the level of natural
catastrophe and weather-related losses compared to the same period of last year. The

FINAL

continued favorable prior year development and our loss reserves and an increase in our
net investment income, these factors were partially offset by an increase in our ex-cat and
weather current accident year loss ratio for reasons I will explain shortly.
Valuation improvements on our available for sale investment portfolio due to a general
decline in U.S. interest rates and credit spread tightening on both investment grade and
high yield corporate debt also contributed to the growth in our diluted book value per
share.
Moving into the details of the income statement, our second quarter gross premiums
written increased modestly by 1% to over 1.2 billion with growth from our reinsurance
segment being largely offset by decreases in our insurance segment.
In our reinsurance segment, our topline was up $38 million or 9%. The increase was driven
by professional reflecting premium increases resulting from an extension to a large
property – excuse me, a large proportional treaty and agricultural lines reflecting
differences in the timing of certain renewals and our continuing initiatives to grow this line
of business.

Bloomberg Transcript

As was the case in Q1, growth was once again impacted by a number of contracts written
on a multi-year basis which had the largest impact on the liability and property lines of
business. The increase in the segment's premiums was partially offset by decreases in the
catastrophe lines which were driven by timing difference, as well as an increasingly
competitive market conditions and the underwriting actions we have taken as a result.
In our insurance segment, our topline was down $27 million or 3% and reflected
decreases in property lines due to timing differences and the impact of increasingly
competitive market conditions.
Professional lines also decreased reflecting the continued reshaping of our U.S. D&O
portfolio. Other notable decreases included a reduction in our credit and political risk
premiums reflecting a reduced number of new deals bound compared to the same
period of last year. Partially offsetting this decrease was the growth in accident and health,
reflecting the continuation of our efforts to expand this line of business.
We have been very pleased with the growth and mix of this business, particularly the
insurance component of the book as we get closer to generating the operating leverage
that will deliver a positive contribution to our net income.
For the first six months of the year, our gross premiums written exceeded $3 billion, a
growth rate of 3%, compared to the first half of last year. This increase was driven by
growth in the reinsurance segment up 7% and was significantly impacted by the level of
contracts written on a multiyear basis, especially in the property, motor, and catastrophe
lines with premiums written of $90 million relating to future underwriting years.

After adjusting for the impact of the multiyear contracts, the increase in the reinsurance
gross written premium of 2% was primarily driven by agriculture, reflecting growth
initiatives for this line of business.

FINAL

Growth in the reinsurance segment was partially offset by a decrease of 2% in the
premiums written in the insurance segment with a decrease driven by the same lines as
the quarterly result.
Our net premiums earned increased 6% to $1 billion in the second quarter of 2014 and by
7% to 1.9 billion for the year-to-date. Increases were noted in both segments with
insurance increases reflecting business written in recent periods in the professional and
liability lines, the continued growth of our accident and health book and the positive
impact of the reductions in our ceded reinsurance programs implemented during 2013.
Reinsurance increases related primarily to growth in our agriculture, professional, and
liability lines.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our second quarter consolidated current accident year loss ratio decreased 7.3 points to
65.1% compared to the same period of last year primarily due to a decrease in the
frequency of natural catastrophe and weather-related events. After adjusting for such
events our current accident year loss ratio increased by four points. The factors that
caused the increase included a change in the mix of business with a relative shift towards
non-correlating and less volatile lines of business that incur a higher loss ratio, which
contribute approximately 2.7 points to the variance, an increase in the current accident
year loss ratio for insurance, professional, and property lines and the impact of lower
rates.
During the quarter with the notable exception of our property lines where we had an
unusual level of fire losses, as did others in the industry, we experienced federal loss
experience across most lines of our business which partially offset the increase in the
current accident year loss ratio. In our Insurance segment, the current accident year loss
ratio decreased 9.3 points to 70.7%, Q2 2014 was impacted by natural catastrophe and
weather-related losses of $30 million primarily related to various weather events in the
United States while we incurred losses of $90 million which was inclusive of reinstatement
premiums for such events in the same quarter of last year.
After adjusting for these losses, the current accident loss ratio increased by 5.1%. This
increase in the loss ratio was driven by an increase in the current accident year loss ratio in
the property lines which were impacted by an increased level of midsized in attritional
primarily fire related losses in recent periods. As was the case in the previous two
quarters we continue to record higher current accident year loss ratios in professional
lines relating to certain parts of our D&O business written in the United States and
reflecting recent loss experience.
As we discussed with you previously, this increase in professional lines primarily relates to
business written during 2012 and 2013 which continues to be earned during 2014. A
change in our business mix also contributed to the increase in the current accident year
loss ratio. These increases were partially offset by a reduction in the mid-size and

Page 5 of 29



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2014-07-30

attritional losses incurred during the quarter in most of the other classes of business,
most notably in the liability lines.

FINAL

For the year-to-date 2014 our current accident year loss ratio for insurance is 67.8%, down
slightly from 68.0% for the comparable period of 2013, mainly reflecting a decrease in the
natural catastrophe and weather-related events in the first half of the year, which was
largely offset by the same factors that impacted our quarterly results.
The second quarter current accident year loss ratio for our reinsurance segment was
down 5.9 points to 60.4% and 1.9 points to 60.1% for the first six months of the year,
primarily due to the reduction in the catastrophe and weather-related losses. We
recognized $6 million of natural cat and weather-related losses during the second quarter
of 2014, while comparatively in 2013 we incurred losses of $50 million after reinstatement
premiums for such events.

Bloomberg Transcript

After adjusting for the cat and weather-related events of our second quarter, current
accident year loss ratio increased by 3 points. The primary factor that contributed to this
variance was the change in the business mix with growth in the agriculture, professional,
and liability lines while approximately one point of the increase related to loss trends
being in excess of rate increases.
Turning to loss reserves established in prior years, our results continue to benefit from net
favorable loss reserve development which aggregated to $85 million during the second
quarter. Short-tail classes in both segments contributed $73 million of this balance,
primarily reflecting better than expected loss emergence. This included a release of $13
million of reserves across both segments relating to the Q2 2013 natural catastrophe and
weather-related events. For the year-to-date these short-tail lines contributed $101 million
of net favorable prior year development.
In addition we continue to give way to actuarial methods that reflect our favorable
experience for liability and professional reinsurance business which contributed a further
$12 million of favorable development for the quarter. Our year-to-date favorable loss
reserve development is $129 million compared to $97 million recognized during the first
six months of 2013.
During the second quarter and first half of 2014 our acquisition cost ratio increased by 1.3
points and 1.4 points respectively compared to the same periods in 2013. Increases were
noted in both segments, driven by higher commissions paid on certain new treaties,
reduced commissions received due to a lower premium ceded following changes in our
ceded reinsurance programs, partially offset by increased commission rates and changes
in business mix.
Our G&A ratio was 15% for the quarter compared to 15.8% last year. We expect that this
ratio will drop below 14% by 2017; following cost-saving actions that are currently being
implemented.

FINAL

Overall, the company reported an underwriting income of $127 million and a combined
ratio of 90.8% for the second quarter. On a year-to-date basis, our underwriting income is
235 million with a combined ratio of 91.3%.
Net investment income was $115 million for the quarter, up from $83 million in the previous
quarter and up from $83 million in the second quarter of last year. The most significant
driver of the increase was the contribution to net investment income buy our other
investments portfolio which benefited from the strong performance of the equity markets
during the quarter.
In the aggregate, the total return on our cash and investment portfolio for the quarter was
1.6%. The positive total returns for the quarter were due mainly to price improvements on
our fixed maturity portfolio as a result of a general decline in U.S. interest rates and
continued spread tightening.
The year-over-year increase in our cash and investment portfolio of 183 billion was due to
valuation improvements on our available for sale investment portfolio and proceeds from
our senior notes issuance which was completed during the first quarter of 2014.

Bloomberg Transcript

The duration of our fixed maturity portfolio decreased slightly to 2.9 years at June 30th,
2014. Our fixed maturity weighted average credit rating remains unchanged at AA minus.
Our interest expense increased by $5 million driven by interest due on new senior notes
as the net proceeds from the first quarter senior notes issuance are expected to be used
towards the repayment of $500 million of our senior unsecured notes, which are due on
December 1, 2014. We expect our quarterly interest charges to be $7 million less than the
2014 levels in 2015.
During the quarter, we repurchased 3.1 million common shares at an average price of
$45.59 for a total cost of $139 million. This brings our total purchases for the year to over 7
million common shares at a total cost of $318 million. As of today, we have $450 million of
remaining authorization under our board authorized share repurchase program for
common share repurchases through December 31, 2015.
As we discussed with you previously, provided that market and financial conditions remain
the same, we anticipate returning close to 100% of our annual operating earnings to our
shareholders through common dividends and share repurchases. Our strategic expansion
opportunities continue to progress well with our Lloyd's vehicle making a successful entry
into the London market and we continue to evaluate opportunities for AXIS Ventures, our
new third party capital initiative.
Overall, we were very pleased to report good (20:32) quarter results and what our
competitive market conditions. We're confident that actions we're taking now both in
growing and reshaping our existing book of business combined with the various initiatives
aimed at generating new sources of revenue leave us well placed to continue to provide
superior returns to our shareholders.

FINAL

Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Thank you, Joe. With respect to market conditions for insurance, after three years of
attractive pricing improvements in the industry, we have seen a leveling off pricing overall
with modest decreases across some of the property and specialty lines. However,
despite a slowdown in pricing there remain good fundamentals and opportunities for
profitable growth in many insurance lines of business.
Within our insurance segment, the overall AXIS insurance rate change for the second
quarter of 2014 was minus 2%, down from the plus 1% last quarter and plus 3% in the
same quarter last year.
Pricing declines and property related lines generally drove this result as casualty pricing
remained strong. Rate changes across U.S. lines were generally stronger than changes in
the international lines and rates overall are generally in step with loss trends.

Bloomberg Transcript

In our U.S. division overall rate was flat, in line with last quarter, after positive rate changes
over 12 consecutive quarters and we also maintained strong renewal retentions across all
lines.
Price weakened in most, but certainly not all property lines while casualty lines continued in
a positive direction. New business in our U.S., P&C operations, primarily comprised
casualty lines with the greatest contribution from U.S. excess casualty, where prices
benefited from 13 quarters of rate improvement.
The U.S. is the strongest of the geographies in which we operate with respect to pricing
environment. This favorable U.S. market works in our favor as close to 60% of our global
insurance business is generated locally out of our 12 offices spread across the country.
Overall, rate in our professional lines division has been broadly stable since 2012. This
quarter about 60% of the portfolio as measured by premiums, experienced flats to
higher rates with the balance being (22:56) declines. The overall rate change was minus
1% in the quarter with strong positive movement in many primary layers while rates in
excess and non-D&O coverages are flat or decreasing. Pricing gains in primary public
D&O are particularly strong supporting our efforts to enhance the profitability of that line.
After strong pricing conditions for close to three years, prices began to come down in our
international division at the end of last year. They were down 5% on average for the
quarter. As usual there were wide variations in rate, depending on the line of business or
geography.
Property and energy markets are exhibiting declining rates from recent highs. Aviation and
terrorism have been in need of a market correction for quite some time. Recent loss

Page 8 of 29

events may provide the required impetus. Area showing positive rate movements include
marine liability and professional lines in Australia and Canada.

FINAL

While the international division may have the largest price declines of all our divisions, it
has also delivered very strong underwriting profitability and in many lines pricing remains
quite attractive. We continue to look for profitable growth and are expanding our
opportunity set through our new Lloyds presence and other distribution initiatives.
So overall, the insurance business still has plenty of opportunity to write attractive
business. Access to the business and risk selections are increasingly an important
differentiator in the market, and we believe AXIX is very well-positioned in that regard.
Moving onto reinsurance. Abundant capacity, strong balance sheets, and consolidations of
reinsurance buying continue to pressure reinsurance pricing across most territories and
lines of business through July 1 renewals.
This has been coupled with some movement in terms and conditions. Multi year
commitments are in great demand broadly impacting all lines of business. Where we saw
an attractive opportunity in committing on a multi year basis, we did so.

Bloomberg Transcript

As you've heard elsewhere, catastrophe pricing has been down anywhere from 5% to
30% depending on location and experience. However, as far as our book is concerned,
the shift in exposure from lower-priced zones and layers to more strongly priced zones
and layers has actually led to a higher premiums per unit of risk.
Notwithstanding the relative absence of alternative capital and casualty lines, traditional
reinsurers have moved aggressively to ship their capital to this sector, leading to softer
terms most visibly evidenced by increases in ceding commissions.
However, in many cases some of these higher ceding commissions are offset by
improvements in primary pricing such as margins are not down as much. We responded to
these changes appropriately, maintaining or in some cases growing our exposures where
profitability was acceptable and reducing or even exiting treaties that we could not
support at the new terms.
Our July 1 renewals, which are dominated by US catastrophe and property renewals saw a
6% decrease in premiums on the expiring portfolio. We did write a few multi year policies.
Adjusting for premiums associated with future years on those policies, estimated annual
premiums decreased 18%. We put back where business no longer met our return
requirements. We started from a strong base and are comfortable with the profit
potential of the portfolio that we have written.
Looking back on the most recent renewals we began to see evidence of pushback on
pricing, terms, and conditions that reached too far. We saw a number of deals that had to
be revisited at the last minute and a number of programs or incumbents, including
ourselves, walked away and needed to be replaced.

FINAL

Similar resistance was met on a competitor's cat issuance. This gives us hope that we are
approaching the leveling and price for cat related lines. That aside, the outlook is for a
continuing competitive global reinsurance market. However within that environment, we
believe that our position as a well rated and strong midsized global reinsurer diversified
product base, innovative approach, and technical strength will serve us well and allow us
to better defend our profitability.
Overall AXIS is well positioned to outperform at a transitioning market as a hybrid insurer
and reinsurer with a wide range of products, strong relationships, superior ratings and
global platform, we see a wide variety of opportunities. Our underwriters have years of
experience dealing with both hard and soft markets and have demonstrable track records
of outperformance in both.
I have total confidence in the power of our market presence and our delivery of service
and technical know-how to our clients and partners and distribution. We are not
dependent on any one line or market and can afford to remain disciplined and pursue only
that business which we consider to be profitable and additive to our portfolio. And while
we see some pressure on reinsurance business we also get the benefit of better terms
on the reinsurance we purchase so we have very good balance.

Bloomberg Transcript

With that said, we are also a company focused on improving our underwriting
performance per unit of risk and operational efficiency and I am confident that the
changes we have started to put in place over the past few years will deliver positive
earnings momentum independent of the market cycle.
We are committed to delivering a stronger, more stable stream of earnings. Over the last
several years, we have been rebalancing AXIS's book of business toward lower volatility
and non-correlating lines. This has entailed taking advantage of favorable market
conditions to grow established non-cat exposed lines and expand geographically as well
as selectively adding new teams and lines.
The additions include accident and health, a variety of new professional lines, a revived
U.S. primary casualty business and global agricultural reinsurance. While it is true that most
of these lines of higher target combined ratios than that of our older book of business,
they generally support significantly higher operating leverage and higher investment
income growth over time, such that we should be able to generate strong ROEs even
with the higher combined ratios.
Most of these initiatives incurred to G&A expenses including start-up expenses which
grew ahead of technical underwriting profits. However, over the next few quarters, many
are expected to reach sufficient scale to cover the G&A load and contribute more
positively to our results.
I'd like to emphasize that expected improvements in profitability for these initiatives do
not require improved underwriting results, but rather more scale that we believe can be
achieved even in this market environment. Our accident and health business, which is
headed for breakeven performance this year, is a good example of this.
Page 10 of 29

FINAL

We are also working diligently to drive higher returns to enhance data and analytics. We
are enhancing the tools and resources that are available to our underwriters and business
leaders to optimize their portfolios. There's always some amount of premium within
broader portfolio which is underperforming and requires shedding. It disproportionately
affects the whole result and will therefore be the object of corrective efforts. Improved
data and analytics are underpinning critical portfolio optimization. Underwriting actions
taken recently in our U.S. primary public E&O business is an example of this.
Another example is the use of enhanced data and analytics is our close examination of
micro-concentrations in our cat exposed insurance business and the rebalancing of our
catastrophe exposed portfolio to significantly reduce overall exposure and volatility while
improving risk adjusted returns.
Finally, we are working diligently to enhance operational effectiveness. We are targeting
an expense ratio below 14% by 2017 and have put in place a number of initiatives,
including outsourcing of various IT and finance functions, consolidation of offices and
facilities, procurement and vendor management as well as productivity enhancements.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our 2014 still include some investments to deliver on this goal, but we expect to start
seeing benefits in 2015 with those savings growing into 2016, 2017, and beyond. We
expect all of the aforementioned underwriting and expense related initiatives to deliver
4.5 points of incremental margin by 2017 all other factors remaining constant.
At a minimum, the portfolio repositioning of our U.S. primary D&O business and expected
profitability of our A&H business along with some of the low hanging fruit and portfolio
improvements and expense efficiencies should deliver between 1 points and 2 points of
progress by the end of 2015.
The good news that many of the gains to be had are not price driven and therefore
independent of the vagaries of the P&C cycle. And we will keep looking for more
opportunities to improve results.
As we implement the initiatives already identified we do not expect the accident year
combined ratio to be consistently improving, but to move up or down modestly,
particularly in quarters such as this which bear the burden of normal expected volatility for
our industry.
And while we expect more difficult markets over the next couple of years, any
competitive headwinds will be better weathered by executing the important profit
enhancing activities which are already in place.
Before I leave the discussion of targeted underwriting improvements, I would like to draw
your attention to our underwriting results both with and without prior your developments
as you evaluate our underwriting performance.

FINAL

We have demonstrated prudence in our reserving time and again since our inception,
booking the current year appropriately prudently, taking bad news early and waiting for
significant maturity of an underwriting year before acting on good news.
Inception to date a very significant portion of the $3.5 billion of cumulative underwriting
profit were reported as favorable prior year development. We've recently released our
reserve triangles which provide additional data to aiding your analysis and put our track
record of favorable development in proper perspective.
Our results this year, again, bear out this practice with what we believe to be
appropriately prudent reserving for this year's loss claims offset by favorable prior year
development in our estimate of losses for the cat and weather-related events of 2013
which at the time may have appeared large to investors.
All of the changes we're putting in place should lead to substantially enhanced capital
efficiency and we should be able to grow without the need for significant incremental
capital. Thus we expect to continue returning the bulk of our earnings to shareholders in
the form of share buybacks and dividends.

Bloomberg Transcript

To conclude, we are very proud of the work that we've been doing to position our
company in the top quintile of industry performance. The methodical shift and mix of
business should lead to a less volatile portfolio.
The profit enhancements initiatives in place that I have just discussed should bring core
underwriting margins up to attractive levels. Combined with incremental growth and
invested assets more efficient use of capital and higher operating leverage we should
achieve superior ROEs and growth and book value for the benefit of our shareholders.
We look forward to sharing with you in future calls progress on our current initiatives as
well as the substance of other initiatives we will undoubtedly identify to further improve
performance.
And with that I would like to open the line for questions.

Yes, thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session And the first question
comes from Amit Kumar with Macquarie.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

Thanks and good morning and congrats on the quarter. Just quickly going back to the
discussion on reshaping the portfolio, I am sort of wondering if you could share your
outlook on pricing. I guess what I'm trying to figure out is at what point does margin

Page 12 of 29

compression from pricing overtake the benefits accrued from, I guess, incremental capital
freed up as well as expense initiatives as we carry on into 2014 without any large losses?

FINAL

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

That's a good question Amit. I'm not sure that I can totally project where pricing will be.
What I can tell you is whatever happens to pricing the initiatives that we've put in place are
going to give us a relative benefit no matter what the direction of pricing.
But generally, I would say that where pricing has been these days, it has been towards a
continuation of good performance, good pricing performance for casualty and
professional lines and less so on property and catastrophe exposed lines. And, as you
know, the shift that we've been making has in fact been towards those casualty and
professional lines. So we're shifting the book towards lines of business that have
demonstrated continued pricing improvements and reducing some of our exposure to
catastrophe and property exposed which are seeing the most difficult pricing conditions
right now.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

That's fair enough. The two other questions, quick questions are can you touch upon, first
of all, any exposure you might have to the recent aviation losses as well as other losses in
Q3 to-date?

FINAL

So, let me just run through a couple of different claims for you on Malaysian Airlines. We
were on both losses, but together the exposure on both was less than $8 million. One of
those was already booked in Q1 and the second one will be incurred in Q3. Libya Tripoli
actually we have no exposure. Windstorm Ela, if that's how it's pronounced, is a
reinsurance exposure, not material and it's been reserved for in Q2. TransAsia Airlines is a
Q3 event, very small impact to us, Air Algeria, no exposure. And the Korean ferry
exposure was fairly immaterial to us. So, in general, fairly low or no exposure.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

Got it. That's helpful. And I guess the only other question I have, was just going back to
the discussion on crop, can you sort of talk about where the book is running at and what
sort of hedges you might have in place to protect you from continued adverse
momentum in the crop prices? Thanks.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Yes. Our Ag book is running in the low 90s on a technical basis, we don't have a lot of
overhead in the crop business so that's a pretty good indicator of where our results are
for both the second quarter, as well as a year-to-date basis. Because of some concerns
frankly about pricing on the crop side, our reinsurance operation, our Ag operation
decided to hedge some of that exposure, and actually that turned out to benefit us in the
second quarter.

Thank you. And the next question comes from Dan Farrell with Sterne, Agee.

Q - Dan Farrell

{BIO 4935961 <GO>}

Hi and good morning. Just a question on buyback, looking into win seasons season in the
near term. In past win seasons but not all of them you have slowed down buyback, I am
wondering how you are approaching that strategically this quarter, particularly given where
the valuation of stock is currently?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Dan, very good question, as a matter of fact because of the fact that our stock price is
trading where it is, we have decided to restart our share buybacks in Q3 and as soon as
Page 14 of 29

our quiet period is over we will begin to do that.

FINAL

Q - Dan Farrell

{BIO 4935961 <GO>}

Great. Thank you. And then just one question on the insurance business, we have had a
couple of quarters of higher property losses in these fire losses, and you are not alone in
the industry, others have seen them. I guess my question is there has been mixed change
where you have gone a little smaller, (40:30), has the mix changes exposed you to some
of these more than they would have in the past? Or are we just seeing what is a higherthan-expected level regardless of the mix changes?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Dan, that's an excellent question and it's worth dealing with. I think the biggest issue with
our mixed change in the property book is that over the last three years we have actually
walked away from significant amount of premium that historically had given very, very low
combined ratios and helps to subsidize the property results in cat free years.

Bloomberg Transcript

However, upon review, we determine that those premiums exposed us to significant
volatility and determined that it was best not to renew that business. So part of the
business mix was that we reduced cat exposed premiums. What this does is it gives you a
book of business that has a traditionally higher average combined ratio over time, but
with much lower volatility.
And again, as I mentioned in the last conference call it's hard to demonstrate that to you
until we have seen a couple of years with and without cat to be able to demonstrate
whether in fact we've delivered that lower volatility. But I think what this does for us is give
us a property book which will give you probably modestly higher "non-cat loss ratio", but
over time a lower overall ratio when you include cat.
And again, we did that for two or three reasons, one was dealing with the volatility of the
book. The second, frankly, again was to make sure that we can deliver more consistent
results as we go forward. All of these things are helping us achieve better capital
efficiency which is one of the drivers of our buybacks.

Q - Dan Farrell

Thank you. And the next question comes from Mike Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs.

Q - Michael S. Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

A couple of numbers questions if I could. Joe, I saw a net investment income there it looks
like there was a big lift in cash and equivalence as the line item is about 6 million. I just
wanted to know, what was that?

Page 15 of 29



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2014-07-30

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

We have some funds withheld trust in our reinsurance operation and this is just an interest
payment, a periodic interest payment that we get. It occurs periodically so a little bit of an
unusual number.

FINAL

Q - Michael S. Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Is that something we should expect on an annual basis or is it just sort of, kind of sporadic
frequency?

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

No, no. It is more on an annual basis. In Q2 that payment was $4.5 million, but those funds
stay there, so basically it's interest owed. We are accruing that, you know and I won't say
we haven't been accruing in the past, but we are accruing it more accurately going
forwards, so I think you will see more of a smooth impact of that rather than a lumpy
impact.

Q - Michael S. Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it. Okay. Great! And then to the corporate expense line, I just saw that it look like it's
running a little bit elevated, kind of in the $30 million range, up a bit from last year, should
we expect that to revert or is that something that you expect to kind of – and I'm also just
curious sort of what's in there? How should we think about that line item as well?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Yes, two things, one, you have to look at allocations from our business units as well. You'll
notice, but down on the insurance and reinsurance side our actual expense ratios are
down. An annual reshifting of business from our segments to our corporate level was
more appropriate that some of these expenses were corporate level, not necessarily
directly business trip and so we just moved things around a little bit.
I think a better way to look at it is on a consolidated basis. You will see about 0.8% drop in
our expense ratio this quarter from last year. Last year, we had some unusually high
expenses in there, we closed one of our offices and terminated a lease early so that had
an impact of about four tenths of a point, so half of the drop in the ratio was really due to
that.
As Albert was just explaining, we are making some investments in the short-term. We'd
expect our expense ratio to float in that 15% to 15.5% range at least in the short-term, but
with the initiatives that we have in place, we're going to bring that down to the sub 14
over the next couple of years.

Q - Michael S. Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it. And so if we're thinking about the expense ratio down at the segment level, any
thoughts on just how we should think about that line which is obviously not running

Page 16 of 29



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2014-07-30

through the segments and not running through the ratios, but then does flow-through
profitability?

FINAL

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Yes, in terms of the segments, I would say that would likely stay pretty stable because we
have got the allocations down to a level where everybody agrees with them quite frankly,
I think. But separately on the corporate area, we occasionally incur some lumpiness in
those numbers. Again I would look at it more on an annual basis than I would look at it on
a quarterly basis to give you an idea of the run rate.

Q - Michael S. Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it, okay. And then maybe just to understand, Albert, you mentioned 1 to 2 point
improvement by the end of 2015. Just trying to get an idea of like what is starting point
for that? Is that the year-to-date underlying, is that year-to date adjusted for something
else or should we be taking this where we are reinsurance and insurance as a starting
point and then because of some of the things you mentioned assume that we can see
some improvement from here? I'm just trying to get an idea of where – what's the starting
point for that improvement.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Right, Mike just one thought, you mentioned in your first question that corporate wasn't
included in the combined ratios. While it's true that it's not reported in the segment
combined ratios, in the consolidated combined ratio we do add the 3 points of corporate
overhead. So...

Q - Michael S. Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

So our consolidating combined ratio gets it.

Q - Michael S. Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it, sure, sure.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

With regard to the improvement plans, I think the best way to look at it is to look at it from
the ex-cat's current accident year results. So you take the six months, you take a look at
where we are right now and we think that these benefits that we can achieve are from
what we've reported in this six month period.

Q - Michael S. Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

So you are including the development in sort of that starting point?

No. I just said it's the current accident year results.

FINAL

Q - Michael S. Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Okay. I got it. Okay, great. And then in terms of the reinsurance business, specifically I
guess the insurance business specifically, can we get some idea of how much
adjustments you are taking in the professional liability book are impacting the current
ratio?
And should we expect that if it is a years' worth of business that we should start to see
that impact/ mitigate in maybe the third quarter or the fourth quarter of this year? And
then we'll be back to more pure underlying level at that point?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Right, let me make sure I understand your question, you said reinsurance?

Q - Michael S. Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

I am sorry – I meant insurance. Yes.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Thank you. Our reinsurance professional lines is doing just fine, thank you. I think with
regards to the professional line we're looking at this thing dragging for about a year now.
Now we're going to start to see improvements already in the second half of this year if
only because the unearned premium that is being amortized with a much larger amount in
the first half of the year than will be in the second half of the year and there will be a very
modest amount that will go through probably the first half of 2015. But we expect to see
improvements in the professional lines results in the second half of this year growing, of
course, into 2015.

Q - Michael S. Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Okay. So in other words where – in underlying insurance – your current accident year
number is kind of 64, 65 for the first half of this year, you would – we should expect that
professional liability has weighed on that that because of the level of unearned premium
that is remaining that that number should normalize in even the back half of this year?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Yes, I mean, if you look at it, we think that just that nut of that older unprofitable
professional lines probably cost us a couple of points in the first half of this year. And that
drag should come down in the second half, as I said, because there's a less of that book
to earn. And over the next 12-ish months I think should probably – that much disappear but
it's cost us two points in the first half of this year.

FINAL

So Mike, just to add to that. Our unearned premium reserve on the 2013 policy year
business was about $60 million at the end of June. That will be down below $20 million by
the time when we get to the end of the year. Now you're bringing on business written in
the 2014 policy year at lower loss ratios, because of the fact that the underwriting actions
that the team has taken. So basically you're running off higher loss ratio business and
bringing on business that has lower loss ratios.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

And I want to make sure that we are being appropriate here, in the conversation, you
know very well that one does not take a portfolio and take it from point A to point B in a
single renewal. So we are – we obviously it's going to be an improvement path that's
going to take at least a couple of years, but we're going to see that improvement
demonstrated through the numbers over the next couple of years. But what we are telling
you is what we're seeing as the current impact.
Our guys are doing an outstanding job of focusing on rebalancing the portfolio, increasing
attachment points, reducing limits, getting pricing, it's been – it's really been a pleasure to
watch because they're very, very focused on it.

you added in that book I guess last year how are those holding up from prior years? So
are you seeing any continued adverse development at all?

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Jay, it's Joe. As we mentioned in Q1 we actually had hardly any losses. The loss activity in
Q2 has returned to a more normalized level, but on a six-month to six-month basis we've
actually had about $30 million less in reserve activity than we did a year ago. So in short, I'll
tell you that we're happy with the runoff of the reserves that we established at the end of
the year.

Well, as you know, I feel pretty proud about the team we have when it comes to thirdparty capital. I think we've got some of the innovators and leaders of that area. We're
doing a lot of little things. We've got a number of transactions that we've booked with a
number of different parties providing either quarter shares to some of our books of
business or ceding business to ventures and so on. That is going to be increasing over
time. We are exploring a lot of different ideas. I think it's too early to discuss what those
ideas might be. But as you point out, we've got the right people and the right book of
business to interest alternative capital, and it's something that we will continue to work on

Thank you. And the next question comes from Max Zormelo with Evercore.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Max Zormelo

{BIO 18929802 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. I wanted to focus on the insurance segment for a minute, I wanted to
look at the – if we could talk about the accident year loss ratio ex-cat, I was hoping if you
could isolate – quantify the impact of the mid-size and high attritional losses, professional
lines and changing business, all those three pieces, you could just quantify the impact,
what I'm trying to get at is what is the core number? The true underlying accident year
loss ratio ex-cat if you could please help me with that? Thanks.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Yes, Max look, let me get to the answer first and then I would give you the components of
it. We think the 64% accident year loss ratio ex-cat for insurance is probably higher by a
couple of points from where it is at 64. So a year ago we were at 59, and now we're at
64, it is about a 5-point change.
So if you've looked at the components of that, first in terms of rate versus trend although
we are still getting some benefit from rate increases in prior periods, the loss trend is
actually exceeding rate of bed so that's worth about a point. Two points of that change is
really due to mix of business. We are adding, as you know, accident and health as part of
the insurance operation. We are also growing our liability lines. So the mix piece of that is
call it 2 points, 1.8 points, but call it 2.
On the property side of the house and on the professional line side of the house as we
discussed, we've increased initial expected loss ratios on the professional lines to deal
with the CMS issues that we talked about today and in the past. And we have got a higher
level of property losses which are worth about 3 points of that change. So, again we have
increased initial expected loss ratios, but in the quarter, we had higher than expected
property losses, which was worth about that three points. Does that help?

FINAL

Yes. That's helpful. Second one, is the numbers question. Looking at the net investment
income this quarter the – I am looking at the fixed income portfolio and that went up quite
a bit even though the yield is flat and duration hasn't changed much I'm just curious what
is driving that?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Yes. We have TIPS securities within our investment portfolio and there is a CPI adjustment
that is made, I believe, twice a year so that had the impact of increasing our fixed maturity
investment income by a couple of million dollars from where it is, actually $5 million to be
specific.

Q - Max Zormelo

{BIO 18929802 <GO>}

Okay. That's helpful. Last one, if I may. Just, big picture I've noticed you've written quite a
bit of multi year contracts and listen to the prepared remarks (56:16) in the market on,
price declines was probably driving to the point where you could start to see the price
declines slow down a little bit. So I'm trying to square that up with the fact that you wrote
more multiyear contracts in the second quarter, if you could please help me with that?
Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I think it's simply a question of what works for us and works for the client. And as I
mentioned to you, although we certainly saw some pushback I think it would be
inappropriate for me to call the bottom to the price. We do continue to expect some
competitive environment and so for the right accounts on the right terms it is appropriate
to write some multi-years. And for other accounts it's not. So it's only a small fraction of
our contract, I believe under 30 if I'm not mistaken.

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Thirty in the second quarter.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

30, yes that were multiyear. So it's a selective and judicious use of that structure to work
with long-standing and profitable clients. So it's really balancing – it's a balancing act.

Q - Max Zormelo

All right. Thank you.

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Max, let me add that those long-term agreements, the multiyear deals are spread out
over a several different lines of business. As Albert said that I missed it, I'm sorry, but it's
spread out, it's cat, it's property, it's Ag, it's motor and it's liability, so it's spread out
across the whole portfolio, it's not in any one area.

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

I just wanted to understand one of your comments, you talked about that we should not
expect the accident year loss ratio to improve significantly from where we are I guess
year-to-date. Does that mean that the improvements that we would expect from D&O
and heightened fire losses is going to be offset by other deterioration or were your
comments excluding that?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Meyer, thank you for raising it, I probably misspoke. What I meant to say was, it's not a
straight line. You have to expect that there will be some quarterly volatility. That is all I
meant. I continue to expect improvements in those loss ratios. I think the volatility of our
industry just causes me to be cautious and not predict or promise straight line
improvement.

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

Good morning, thanks for fitting me in. I just had a follow-up regarding the multi-year and
Albert you said I think that annualized premium would be down 18% in the reinsurance
group if it was excluding the multi-year. Did I understand that correctly?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

For the Cat premiums that we renewed on July 1, the annual premium would be down
18%, once you exclude the impact of the multi-year payments. It's not with regard to the
entire reinsurance book; after all we are growing in other parts of the reinsurance book. I
was specifically speaking to the July 1 renewals.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Charles J. Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

Okay. Further on the reinsurance side I guess I would just like to better understand the
strategy that you guys have. I know you've given some discussion previously about your
portfolio and the business mix and I guess I am specifically referring to the southeast
hurricane exposure, the 1-of-50 and 1-of-100 that relative to my understanding the pricing
dynamics. Is it just sort of a late catch-up or why the growth in this segment now versus
the beginning of 2013 or the beginning of 2012, et cetera?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Well I think it's really a question of trying to optimize the portfolio that we have at every
renewal. I think we need to – let's put this in perspective if I may. You've heard me speak
about managing our cat exposure and calculated volatility being a key focus of ours.
So, what have we done? Right? So we've rebalanced our book. We've shifted the
composition of individual portfolios. We talked about the micro zonal concentrations.
We've reduced our weights in zones that were underpriced or in which we were
overweights. And we increased exposure in better priced zones where we were
underweight.
This resulted in, I guess, essentially a reduction in all zones excluding Florida and the Gulf
which have historically have been among the largest and best priced markets and where
we, as you point out, increased our PML.
The PML for Florida is still down the 1-in-250 from where it was a couple of years ago, but
certainly the 1-in-50 and 1-in-100 has gone up. I think your point about why we didn't do it
a year or two though. I can only tell you that we did it now.

that some of the other things that we have done is we've improved our corporate
protections. We are making better use of reinsurance, retro and the cat bonds and you
speak to the PMLs. But there's another statistic that I probably worth is talking about, and
although it's not released, let me give you a sense of what I'm referring to here.
We look at the modeled annual aggregate net loss, so all of the cat losses from all cat
exposed business the total for the year, and we look at this both before and after the
application of premiums and we look at it both in terms of dollars and we look at it in
terms of percentage of our equity.

Bloomberg Transcript

And that basically says, how much of our earnings are risk and how much of our book
value is at risk not to a single event which is what PML captures, but to a full-year results,
2011 being a good example of what happens and a multi-cat year. If you look at our 1-in100 and our 1-in-250 year modeled annual aggregate cat claims that are down by close to
15% in the last 12 months. And they're actually down almost 30% from the high in 2011.
Now, I told you about shifting from better price zones and better price layers, if you then
apply this number and you then say okay what happens to that modeled (1:03:20) loss
number, net of the premiums? Well, that the 15% reduction that I indicated to you for the
last 12 months on the Ag loss, when you add the premium impact that reduction is close
to 20% of the loss. And over the last three years almost double that.
And what this demonstrates to us is we are actually getting more premium per unit of risk,
so we are both significantly reducing the aggregate modeled cat risk to the company,
improving our return per unit of risk even in a declining pricing environment. And these are
the kind of activities that we are putting in place to reduce cat volatility, ultimately translate
to lower cat related losses and hopefully steadier growth in book value over time.

All right. One other. I was just curious you mentioned early on about the med mal business
that got set up this year, and just wondering if there's any additional color you could
provide on how that business is going?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

It is very early stage; we brought on a team in the first half of this year. We spent several
months working on the usual licensing issues, setting up the offices, processes and
controls, the whole usual issues. And we've engaged in the market and we are now
quoting and binding, but it's still very, very early. However, we are very confident that this
is a team that has a very strong track record and this will be a slow, methodical growth,

but it's – but it does add good diversification to our already very well-diversified
professional lines portfolio.

FINAL

I appreciate the answers. Thank you.

Thank you. And the next question comes from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.
Hi. Thanks for taking question. This is (1:05:10) for Kai Pan. I just had a quick question as
you guys are taking down the cat exposure within the reinsurance segment you still had
very strong return on equity results. So just kind of curious sort of what returns you're
seeing within the cat related business that you writing and/or where you kind of feel the
market is currently?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I'm not sure how to answer that because again I think one of the things that we look at is
not only the individual terms, it's – as I mentioned in my earlier answer it's how it builds
into the total portfolio, and the improvement of the portfolio, but there is no question that
returns on cat business overall that we're seeing in the market are probably down 15%,
20% over the last couple of years.
So, one of the issues that is clear to us is that in some accounts, in some zones we are
getting very close to the bottom because or at least the traditional market in my mind
probably won't be able to support much more in certain accounts and certain zones.
Other zones and accounts do provide acceptable pricing.
Obviously in Florida, which was the highest – you know, among the highest priced
markets, even with some of the changes there are still several accounts that provide
acceptable profitability. You know where it goes from here I can't tell you. But the feeling
that we get is that the traditional market, at least, is starting to put some pushback.

Q - Operator
Thanks. And then just one quick question for Joe, follow-up to Jay's earlier question kind
of on the reserving. You talked about the professional liability, but that was a great
number you guys put on the reserve releases this quarter, is there any kind of more color
you want to talk about in terms of where you did the reserve study this quarter and/or
anything else that might help us sort of going forward as to how we are thinking about
modeling it out?

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Yes. The only thing I would maybe add is the fact that of the $85 million in total reserve
releases, $30 million of it came from property in the 2013 accident year. So this is releases

from very recent property related business which goes back to the point that Albert was
making during his comments.

FINAL

As far as CMS is concerned, it's a normal reserve study that we do every quarter and as I
mentioned we are very happy with the way the reserves that we set up at the end of
2013 are running of.

Q - Operator
Thanks so much and thanks for taking the question.

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

You're welcome.

Operator
Thank you. And the next question comes from Ian Gutterman with Balyasny

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi, thank you. I guess first can I get a couple of clarifications on some numbers, or Joe,
you mentioned UEP on the D&O book was $60 million, now and you expect $20 million by
year and, where was that at the beginning of the year that $60 million?

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

133.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Perfect, thank you. And then similarly on the 4% to 5% combined ratio improvement by
2017, you said 1% to 2% by the end of 2015 on the D&O and A&H the G&A seems better
another point, so it seems there is another two points of other stuff; a) Is my math right?
b) What is the other stuff ?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

When we talk about four to five points, there's actually a couple of things. One is we
actually expect probably another point as we fully work out the business mix. And that will
be offset by other improvements. As you point out, there's a couple of points next year
that we expect from a combination of CMS, A&H some expenses. But as I also said earlier
in the call, I think that the improvement in CMS is going to be more than just one year,
because I think there is a transition being done in that book which will take a couple of
years and will contribute to the improvements in a couple of years.
The other area is that some of our subscale, and I should watch my words as I say that
because they are growing well, they are growing into their book. But we've got a handful
of initiatives that are in fact expected to grow, and as I mentioned earlier, cover their G&A
and start to contribute positively. That's one of the factors. Another factor is that we are –

FINAL

one of the things that I'm absolutely adamant about is that we need to give our
underwriters the tools and the resources for them to make the right decisions about their
portfolios. And CMS being a perfect example, the analysis comes in and says you know
what, this piece let's not write, this piece let's write some more of. We're doing that in
terms of a more granular analysis of the portfolios across the books of business. And
we've already defined some of the areas that we can start to improve upon and we will
do that.
So it's a combination of a number of different factors. And as I said in my prepared
remarks, I'm sharing with you what we've identified now. We're not going to put our
pencils down; we're going to continue to look for ways to optimize this portfolio as we go
forward.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Great. If I could just have one more on the underwriting strategy. You had a bit of – I guess
maybe unexpected or maybe contrary results of growing your reinsurance and shrinking
your insurance, can you explain why it all makes sense. I'm not so much questioning that I
just want to probe a little bit on why that is happening. And I guess two things I was
thinking about. One is on the insurance side why not buy more reinsurance? You
mentioned some pressure on expense ratio from getting rid of reinsurance, given how
attractive it is, why not buy mode. And on the reinsurance side we obviously talked about
the multi-years earlier and I understand the strategy I guess my only question on the
multi-years is, do you have to give up rate to get multi-years or are you getting multiyears at market clearing rates here, so it is kind of a free option if you think the market is
going to decline further?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Let me deal with the multi-year. As I said it's really part of an overall portfolio and client
relationship. We don't need to give up rates. I think a lot of clients are happy to lock in
these terms. For a couple of years, three years, and under the right circumstances it's
something that we are prepared to do.
With regard to the growth of insurance versus reinsurance, frankly if you take away the
multi-years and you look at annual premium production which is what we do mostly on the
insurance side, the difference in the growth rates between one and the other really don't
come across as that significant. And there is always, including in this quarter in this year,
timing issues.
Contracts that were written for 15 months or 18 months where extensions are occurring
and so I wouldn't read too much about that yet, but there's no question that in insurance,
the U.S. D&O book, we are shrinking that book because we're fixing that book. Obviously
there has been some good growth in A&H but that's from a smaller base.
In professional lines we've had the benefit – sorry in reinsurance, we've had the benefit of
continued good growth in agriculture reinsurance and as Joe mentioned earlier, the
benefit of an extension of a large contract. So, there's always little things going there. It is

FINAL

not our intent to grow any book of business unless we believe that that will offer attractive
business opportunities.
Now, with regard to the reinsurance, I will say that we look at reinsurance every year, and
while it's true that last year we did reduce our retentions in a number of books of
business, as we were reviewing our reinsurance buys this year, that has not been in the
same way. Most of our quota shares have been kept flat, except that our global D&O
book we actually increased our sessions. So last year we ceded 32.5% of our global D&O
book and this year we are seeding 40% of our D&O book.
With regards to our property per risk towers, we've purchased more coverage on our
property per risk towers. We've also purchased some more catastrophe protection on
both insurance and reinsurance. So, we continue to modify the book to make sure that we
get the best mix, if you would of ceded and retained results.
