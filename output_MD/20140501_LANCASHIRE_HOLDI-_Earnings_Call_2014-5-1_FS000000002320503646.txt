MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good afternoon and welcome to the Lancashire Holdings Q1 2014 Results Call.
Throughout the call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode, and afterwards, there'll
be a question-and-answer session. Just to remind you, this conference call is being
recorded.
Today, I'm pleased to present Alex Maloney, Group CEO. Please begin your meeting.

Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for dialing in. I'm
joined by following colleagues. We have Elaine Whelan, our Chief Financial Officer; Paul
Gregory, our Chief Underwriting Officer; and Peter Scales, our Cathedral CEO; and Darren
Redhead, our Kinesis CEO. And we also have Denise O'Donoghue, who's our Group
Head of Investments.
As I've already said elsewhere, a lot has changed for the Lancashire Group during the first
quarter of 2014. Kinesis has been launched very successfully. We've integrated well with
our new colleagues from Cathedral. We've expanded the Lancashire lines into Syndicate
3010 in Lloyd's; and we've completed building out our Bermuda Property Cat XL portfolio.

FINAL

We've also added a modest allocation of risk assets to our investment portfolio to help
balance our interest rate risk, and we're progressing along the road to Solvency II
compliance.
In the wider market, it is clear that retained earnings and new capital are outstripping any
increase in demand in the reinsurance and retrocession world. And this, in turn, is
displacing capital into the direct insurance lines. But the barriers to entry in direct business
are much stronger than in the highly commoditized world of property retrocession.
Our energy, D&F, marine, and aviation policies are intricate and detailed and require a real
level of expertise, not just in pricing, but in the adjustment of claims, too. Clients and
brokers respect this and want to know that their insurer is an expert in their field, with a
track record in setting premiums and paying claims.
The Cathedral US property Cat XL book is a prime example of relationship-driven
business, where the performance over 20 years has more than ensured enduring
customer loyalty. There have been some indications, as well, that some of the broker
facilities we have seen are failing to gain new traction and some are even losing their
existing support.

Bloomberg Transcript

In terms of people, obviously, the big news is retirement of our founder, Richard Brindle,
which took effect from yesterday. Richard helped to build a remarkable franchise at
Lancashire, which has led its peer group in numerous metrics across the last eight years.
His insistence on process and systems has ensured that I and the rest of the
management team, have a smooth path to take over the running of the group. So we
sincerely thank Richard for his vision and energy, but I am utterly confident that we have
the right team to build on his success to-date.
I now hand over to Elaine Whelan.

Paul Gregory

Paul Gregory.

Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Sorry, Paul Gregory.

Paul Gregory

{BIO 16314515 <GO>}

Thanks, Alex. We're undoubtedly in a challenging market, but the strength of our franchise
across the three pillars of our business is helping us to weather these challenges, defend
our core portfolio, and even grow in some selected areas.

FINAL

Lancashire, Cathedral and Kinesis add value through their ability to deploy significant
amounts of capacity to lead important contracts, and to fairly and promptly adjust claims.
This can clearly be seen in Kinesis' deployment of $290 million of limit in the quarter, the
robust defense of our core portfolios at both Cathedral and Lancashire UK, and the
successful execution of the switch of catastrophe exposures from retro to Cat XL at
Lancashire Bermuda.
We're working hard on developing our business, with the approval of Lloyd's of our
business plan to add terror and energy lines to Syndicate 3010; continuing to work on new
products for Kinesis; and there's been a strong increase in submissions for Lancashire
Bermuda in UK, up by approximately 17% in the quarter.
With regard to our buildout of Syndicate 3010, we'd like to place on record our thanks to
both our clients and brokers for showing us such strong early support.
In both energy and terrorism, we've been able to make a positive start, finding high
quality additional business to the group, following our approval from Lloyd's at the
beginning of April.

Bloomberg Transcript

It's true that pricing is on its way down in almost all segments and the bright spots are few
and far between. However, in Cathedral's property buying portfolio, where rates are
more closely aligned to the U.S. retail market than the international wholesale market,
prices have been maintained or even improved a little.
On the international Group P&I accounts, rates were up around 20%, although we kept
our premium increase below this level as we slightly reduced our exposure. Our energy
excess liability portfolio pricing was generally flat, at the strong levels attained since
Macondo. But outside of this, pricing was under pressure, and we've had to walk away
from some business in classes where reductions were unjustified. This was seen most
dramatically on the Lancashire Bermuda and Accordion retrocession portfolio, where
pricing reductions of 20% were not uncommon. And as a result, we drastically cut back
exposures and redeployed our capacity into Cat XL.
We've now built a core portfolio of property Cat XL at Lancashire Bermuda to replace the
more opportunistic and potentially volatile retro and large line D&F that we once wrote.
In the right market, we can reenter the retro arena, either through Lancashire Bermuda or
Kinesis. But the majority of our Cat XL relationships are cross cycle. We've been able to
buy $100 million of retro to protect this Cat XL which, in itself, tells you much about how
we view the market.
The energy market is also seeing declines after four years of compound increases. This
extends to Lancashire UK's niche deepwater Gulf of Mexico wind book, but demand
remains buoyant with plenty of new projects and strong relationships with key buyers.
Indeed, we've seen a number of new projects right around the world in offshore energy,
with several of them stretching market capacity, allowing Lancashire to develop our
excess construction portfolio as well.

FINAL

Aviation and marine continues to suffer from an excess of capacity, chasing noncorrelating business. And both Lancashire UK and Cathedral maintain their focus on very
small subsets of the overall markets. The satellite launch portfolio are seeing some
growth year-on-year, but this is unpredictable and should not be read as a trend.
Kinesis followed up the $252 million of limit deployed at 1/1 with an additional $37.5 million
in February, all in its multiclass reinsurance product. Darren Redhead and his team
continue to both receive interest in this from potential clients and to explore other niche
products suitable to a collateralized balance sheet.
One of the other bright spots is the increased availability and better pricing of our own
reinsurances for both Cathedral and for Lancashire. We've been able to buy additional
limit with broader coverage at improved pricing in many areas, which will, again, limit
volatility and improve the net result in the event of any shock losses. As a major borrower
of reinsurance now, we should never forget that the weakening rate environment is not
just a one-way street for our business.
I'll now pass over to Elaine Whelan.

Bloomberg Transcript

Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Thanks, Paul. Hi, everyone. Our results are on our website as usual. We had another
reasonable quarter, producing an overall ROE of 3.9%. As I said in our release, 3.5% of
that comes from Lancashire, with the balance a combination of Cathedral's contribution
and acquisition adjustments. Those acquisition adjustments relate to our finite life
intangible assets and will tail off over the next couple of quarters as we amortize that.
Our total goodwill and intangible asset balance should stand at about $154 million by the
end of the year. (08:23-08:27) and as Paul said, we have drastically cut back our retro
book with only $10.7 million of premiums written in the first quarter compared to $67.6
million in Q1 last year.
Bear in mind (08:39) retro book with Accordion qualifying premiums and is 100% ceded to
the Accordion vehicle. The impact of the reduction in retro and earnings was, therefore,
minimal.
Focus on protecting our core book, combined with the increased market (08:57) business
has increased our premiums from $31.3 million in Q1 2013 to $69.4 million in Q1 2014.
Some of that business was written in a multiyear basis about 30% of the total, so we'll
have the benefit of those earnings coming through next year as well.
Otherwise, the Lancaster lines, there were some small movements resulting in the overall
book being only slightly behind last year in terms of top line. For Cathedral, we picked up
$108.2 million of premium this quarter, a bit behind our Q1 last year mostly due to rate
reductions in the property reinsurance and aviation books.

FINAL

On the ceded side, as I mentioned, we're no longer ceding to the Accordion vehicle, so
there's a substantial reduction for that. We added $40.7 million of ceded premiums from
Cathedral with the balance of the increased spend in the quarter due to the additional
cover (09:50-09:56). We've continued to include Cathedral's income statement in our
supplement, and I noticed there that their insurance spend was lower this quarter
compared to last year. Again, that is a result of improved pricing and available product.
(10:07-10:12) quarter, we've written a little bit of retro but less than last year. Our 1/4
property cat renewals held up reasonably well (10:19-10:27)

Please, start your paragraph again.

FINAL

Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Okay. Let me pick up in there. The rest of premiums, again. So for the second quarter
we've written a little bit of retro, but less than last year. Our 1/4 property cat renewals held
up reasonably well with pricing off about 15%. For some existing clients who have been
purchasing this year, we generally made up that lost premium on new layers that came to
market.
Overall, depending on how the energy and June property cat renewals go, I'd expect the
Lancashire second quarter book to be broadly flat to last year, and a slight uptick in the
Cathedral book due to the new energy and terror business we expect to write in the
wholly owned syndicate.
Acquisition costs in the first quarter were impacted significantly by the Accordion vehicle
as we received $6.7 million of profit commission and commutation of our quota share as
the vehicle is now in run-off.

Bloomberg Transcript

Excluding the impact of the profit commission and also reinstatement premiums, our
acquisition cost ratio would have been a more normal 20.3%, and I'd expect our adjusted
acquisition cost ratio for the year to be around 20% or 21%.
On losses, there are no real events to speak of and very low attrition reported for the
2014 accident year, but we did have some development in the 2013 accident year, which
gave us net adverse development for the quarter. That was principally in relation to one
large late-reported energy claim, and we'll continue to monitor the development of that
over the coming months.
Our reserves for previous large events were relatively stable. Our accident year loss ratio
was 28.4%, which is a reasonable reflection of our expected attritional losses.
On investments, another positive, if unspectacular, return as we benefited from the
spread down in the quarter. We have more or less liquidated our emerging market debt
portfolio now with just $22 million left, and we've continued to add to our bank loan
portfolio.
We had fairly high cash balances at the end of the quarter and that's, in part, due to the
amalgamation of the Lancashire and Cathedral portfolios; in part holding cash from the
special dividend we just paid; and in part due to funding a small hedge fund portfolio at
the beginning of April.
So far, we have allocated $67.5 million to low volatility hedge funds really to diversify our
portfolio and help manage our exposure to rising interest rates. Our tail risk hedge also
remains in place. You should see our cash come down and our duration extend a bit
through the second quarter. No dramatic changes, but some minor adjustments to
Page 6 of 19



Company N ame: L ancashire H oldings L td
Company Ticker: L RE L N Equity
Date: 2014-05-01

complete our consolidation of the portfolio. We'll also allocate a bit more to our hedge
fund portfolio.

FINAL

On KCM, no real change in financial terms from last quarter as our next draw will be
around 1/6. So on capital called to-date, we'll earn about $5 million in underwriting fees for
the year. Although just be aware, we're earning that in line with the underlying risk profiles
of portfolio Kinesis Re, so it will be earned mostly over the U.S. hurricane season.
Again, profit commissions could be around $9 million, depending on the loss activity, but
we won't receive anything until Q1 2015 at the earliest. $0.6 million of our other income is
the first quarter share of the underwriting fees, with $3 million being the profit
commission we received on the termination of Saltire with that vehicle also now in run-off.
The remainder of our other income is managing agency fees from Cathedral.
Lastly, bits and pieces; G&A is higher, due to the addition of Cathedral, but also the
amortization of our intangible assets. I'd expect the ratio to come down a little over the
rest of the year.
Financing costs are impacted by the mark to market of our interest rate swaps and our
subordinated debt, so around $4 million a quarter is a reasonable reflection of debt and
LSE costs and the like for the mark to market on the swaps.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our tax credit for the quarter is due to the run-off of the deferred tax liability created
from our finite life intangible assets, so that will be fully released by Q3.
Just wrapping up then in capital, our book is broadly stable as we continue to focus on
core clients and our PMLs are in line with expectation. We'll see a little bit of growth in
Syndicate 3010, but nothing particularly capital intensive at this stage.
With the 1/6 and 1/7 property cat renewals coming up and we're in the middle of the Gulf
energy renewals, so we'll see how those go. But as we always say, if there's no change in
market conditions, you can expect a substantial proportion of our earnings will be
returned by way of a special dividend later in the year. We'd, obviously, love to be able to
put our earnings to work, but we don't think that's likely based on our current outlook.
With that, I'll now hand over to the operator for questions.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. Our first question comes from Frank Cawood from Frank Cawood Associates
(15:42). Please go ahead with your question.

FINAL

Yes. Congratulations on a fluid transition, and we all miss Richard and wish him very well.
But I just want you to know that I have the utmost confidence in the bench as it has been
put. I think the bench is, perhaps, stronger than many realized.
Elaine, I have a question for you. On the duration in the portfolio, I know there's been
some talk about the way duration is calculated. It's not necessarily the same as term on
corporate bonds, but some of these could be reset, perhaps, for a longer term. Some of
the duration calculations have to do, I think, with the assumption that they might be called
a little bit early. Have you had any kind of look through into that to see what might happen
to that if some of these were not, in fact, called early?

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

No, we're following a fairly standard duration calculation. But I think one thing just to note
on the duration that's in there, the tail risk hedge that we've got knock about 0.2 off our
duration and we also had pretty high cash balances over the end of the year for paying
dividends and for the amalgamation of the two portfolios between us and Cathedral as
well. And so that kind of brings everything down. And we also liquidated almost all of our
EMD portfolio, and that was also quite a long duration so that brings it down a little bit as
well. And...

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Operator
Okay, that's – yes, good. So the tail risk has been recovering in that area, too. And just a
couple of questions, I guess, for the – maybe this would be for Peter Scales. We noted
there's a little expansion maybe in a new line of business with some other underwriters
coming in with Cathedral. Any comment on that, sir?

A - Peter David Scales

{BIO 2108933 <GO>}

In terms of the energy and terror in Lancashire, we had the Lloyd's approval in the start of
April; started trading two weeks, three weeks later after putting some reinsurance
programs in place. I'm sure Paul Gregory will give you some more color on that. But things
have gone very well. You may have read in the press of some other gentleman may be
joining us, who we are delighted about. Equally, they are currently working for their current
employer, and we would be delighted to give some color on this further down the line
when we're able to do so.
At the moment, they're doing the right thing, looking after their clients and brokers, first
of all; we're very happy to encourage that. And when we have a proper story and we have
some metrics of what effect that will have on the build-out of 3010, we'll be delighted to
share that with you.

Q - Operator
Great, thank you.

A - Peter David Scales

{BIO 2108933 <GO>}

But at the moment, they're doing their job as they're supposed to.

Q - Operator

FINAL

Thanks very much. And for, Alex, again, congratulations on keeping things very well
hedged as you're going into wind season in the U.S. and so that's – I think it's a very good
profile. You could perhaps post a little higher earnings if you hadn't done that, but I'm very
comfortable with that.

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Okay, Frank (18:43). Thank you.

Operator
Our next question comes from Chris Hutchings (sic) [Chris Hitchings] from KBW. Please go
ahead with your question.

Q - Chris D. Hitchings

{BIO 2034501 <GO>}

Good morning. This is Chris Hitchings here. My near brother Chris Hutchings isn't on the
line. Two things: on the cat, I mean, presumably the energy loss is the Statoil, can you give
us some color on how that's being provisioned, and is that the entire component of the
deterioration on the 2013 year?

Bloomberg Transcript

Could you tell us what, if anything, you put in for Malaysian Air and within the numbers and
presumably that's included in your attritional losses at the moment, if at all?
Thirdly, yes, can you give us some color on the words substantial – significant proportion
of the earnings to be distributed in dividend? It seems to be slightly different wording to
what you used in the past. Is that intended to signal anything? I know this is Elaine's
wording, and she's always terribly careful about these things. Thank you.

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Hi, Chris. Thanks for that. We'll go to PG for the energy one. Elaine, can you do the...

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Yeah. I don't know that I'm smart enough to be signaling that much with my words in
terms of substantial earnings. We've been splitting our dividend towards the end of the
year for the last couple of years. It depends very much on our outlook. If we've got a very
solid, clear outlook, then that may mean that we're more comfortable returning a higher
proportion of our earnings, but we've typically been under the kind of 75% to 90% range,
give or take, so that's kind of very substantial, but...

{BIO 2034501 <GO>}

Okay.

...in terms to the 2013 losses, we can't really comment on the specifics of individual claims,
but the insurance provider does always seem to help a little bit with that. There are a
couple of little energy losses in there and also a little bit of development on some
European winter storms on the Cathedral side of things. Again, Malaysian, Cathedral
clearly have a (20:54), but I can't really comment too much on the specifics of it, other
than to say perhaps that their reinsurance program kicks in another $7.5 million...

A - Paul Gregory

{BIO 16314515 <GO>}

Yeah. And with regard to the one particular energy loss from 2013, there is currently a
range on that, which is quite normal for energy losses. And we're conservatively reserved
on that particular loss, quite normal for energy losses – (21:25) nature of the underlying
risk, the things to be notified late every now and again.

Q - Chris D. Hitchings

{BIO 2034501 <GO>}

Sorry, just to come back on the aviation loss, you do not specifically say what you've
provided, but you point out that the $7.5 million retention. Does that mean you have
provided at $7.5 million or more than $7.5 million?

A - Peter David Scales

{BIO 2108933 <GO>}

Chris, it's Peter. The $7.5 million, as you said is a retention; but that's on Syndicate 2010...

Q - Chris D. Hitchings

{BIO 2034501 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay.

A - Peter David Scales

{BIO 2108933 <GO>}

...of which Lancashire piece is 58%, that's the piece to take. But the $7.5 million gets us
into the program and, basically, in the lower, middle reaches of that, the reinstatement
(22:10) are a wash, so it doesn't really make too much difference to us.

Q - Chris D. Hitchings

{BIO 2034501 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks very much indeed.

Operator
Our next question comes from Andy Broadfield from Barclays. Please go ahead with your
question.

Q - Andy D. Broadfield

{BIO 7273415 <GO>}

Hi there. That was quick. I only just pressed the button. Three questions, really, around the
nature of a softening cycle that – I just had some questions around retention, multiyear
contracts, and the split of new business as well.

Page 10 of 19



FINAL

Company N ame: L ancashire H oldings L td
Company Ticker: L RE L N Equity
Date: 2014-05-01

So just on retention, actually maybe this is a first and third together. Retention versus new
business, there's always a conflict between people who actively manage their portfolios
and people who move into new business lines they haven't previously been in, or straying
into sort of parts of business lines they haven't really strayed into before. I was just
wondering if you could characterize, or quantify first, how much of your business in the
first quarter was retained – what your retention levels were versus sort of historic
retention levels and, therefore, the amount of new business you're writing. And also, your
confidence that those areas you are perhaps expanding into a little bit more, there's a
reason why you're picking it up and other people are dropping it off, why you are feeling
confident that you know more than those people who are no longer writing it? That's the
first question.
The second question just around – there was a comment in your release this morning
about multiyear contracts; I think it was only a small passing comment, but again, that's a
typical softening cycle characteristic is to write multiyear contracts. So I just wanted to get
your thoughts on that as well, please.

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Right, okay, Andy. It's Alex. I think our view of the current market is it's undoubtedly getting
more difficult. That means, for Lancashire, that we're still going to be the Lancashire that
we were in the past, but we just go about it a sort of slightly different way.

Bloomberg Transcript

So this market is all about managing your core portfolio. It's all about trying to make that
portfolio more efficient, and that may be the use of more reinsurance. So there's different
ways to get the same result, if you like.
And as I said, everyone focuses on the market reducing, but every time that happens, so
does our reinsurance bill. So there are opportunities there. It is about managing your core
portfolio. You're absolutely right, if you have grand plans in this market, you need to make
sure that you're being honest with yourself, because I think some companies will look to
expand and look to get into lines of business which they don't understand as a function of
a soft market. And that generally goes wrong and there's no reason why, I believe, that
won't go wrong again.
If you think about our approach, our approach is and has always been, we don't go into
any line of business unless we feel we can make a difference, and unless we feel we've
got the best-in-breed underwriters. So the team that's going into Cathedral, if you talk to
some brokers in the market, they are the best-in-breed underwriters, and that is the only
way we will go into any new line of business in this market.
Because, as I said, you have to be honest with yourself. If you don't have the best
underwriters that have got the best track records and the client relationships, you're set
up to fail, whoever you are. And I think we are honest enough to know that you can't
always swim against the tide in this market, but there are things you can do around the
edges, which we will continue to do.

FINAL

The new business, renewal business question is you have to identify where that new
business is coming from. So some of the property cat new business that we've written is
new top layers, so it's not business that we've stolen from someone else. But you are
right, in general, new business can be cheaper than renewal business. And there's no
panic here. There's no one here that's looking to dramatically grow our book. We'll still be
opportunistic, but you have to be realistic about the market.

Q - Andy D. Broadfield

{BIO 7273415 <GO>}

Just a couple of follow-ups on that, I guess, which is one, without adding lumps to your
business like you did obviously with Cathedral, lumps may not sound very flattering, but
chunks of business deal to you, we should expect your portfolio to be shrinking given your
historic capital discipline.

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Yeah. I mean...

Q - Andy D. Broadfield

{BIO 7273415 <GO>}

...and that's not happening, right?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Well, there is different ways to do that. So our portfolio may look similar, but you have to
look about how much reinsurance we're now purchasing and how much volatility you've
got around our earnings. So as the market continues to decline, we will probably stay on
most of our business, which is core business, but we'll probably buy more reinsurance.
If you look at how much reinsurance we've already purchased this year, it's the most
amount of reinsurance we've ever bought in our history. And that will continue as the
market goes down. So we are still going to manage our capital, if you like, but in a slightly
different way. And if we can find – if there's people out there that are more hungry than us
that we can pass some of our risk to, why wouldn't we do that? So nothing has changed.
The way we're going about it is slightly different.

Q - Andy D. Broadfield

{BIO 7273415 <GO>}

Yeah, that all makes sense. I guess, i.e., it's hard for me to imagine how you can be buying
more reinsurance without freeing up more capital, and therefore likely to either be having
declining ROEs because you'll have more free capital you can't utilize or you'll try to use
that by going into more areas. Just that conflict that sort of cyclical or circular argument
that I'm not sure I fully understand, but maybe another conversation offline or something
there.
One final sort of specific question which I think I mentioned around the multiyear
contracts. Is there anything to mention on that or is that just a passing comment on the...?

FINAL

Let me just say one more thing about what you just said there. When you buy in
reinsurance, it's very easy to get sucked into the – you only buy reinsurance because it
looks good on the model. So there will be some reinsurance that we purchased that – on
a technical basis doesn't look the most capital efficient thing you could. But you have to
get the balance of old-fashioned reinsurance buying with some sort of capital relief
reinsurance buying. So you have to make sure you get that correct.
Quite frankly, we could go out and buy $200 million of ILWs tomorrow that would look
great on a model, would give you a huge capital relief, but in the event of a loss, probably
it wouldn't pay. So it's about getting that balance correct.
On the long-term deals, we were very successful selling long-term deals on our energy
Gulf of Mexico book. We started selling those deals because we thought we were at the
top of the market. That has insulated our pricing.
But if you look at the amount of long-term deals we have in the company, overall, it's
probably less than 20%. So we're not going to tie up the majority of our portfolio on a
long-term basis, because obviously, if something happens and rates go up. We don't want
to be locked into the bottom of the market if we are at the bottom.

Bloomberg Transcript

But we're not going to do that. So there will always be a limitation on how much we will
sell on a multiyear basis. I think we're probably where we want to be already. I don't see
us doing a huge amount more.

Q - Andy D. Broadfield

{BIO 7273415 <GO>}

Okay. And I'm sorry to keep going on, but the one last question on that then. The
reinsurance buying that you're talking about then is should we just expect lower volatility
from these reinsurance you're buying, rather than sort of out of the money capital relieftype contracts. Is that the characteristic you're buying at the moment?

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Yeah. I mean, it depends where the loss comes and how big the loss is. So if you look at
our energy portfolio, we can't really buy in much more than we currently buy in. So that
won't stop losses that have happened this month. But if you go to the other end of the
curve, Lancashire's always been very comfortable writing some big lines, and we've taken
some reasonably large net exposures. If one of those claims come home going forward,
yes, our numbers would definitely be less volatile. We're taking out a lot of the tail risk.

Q - Andy D. Broadfield

{BIO 7273415 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you so much.

Q - Maciej K. Wasilewicz

{BIO 16462204 <GO>}

FINAL

Hi. I've got a couple of annoying specific questions, and then one more general question.
First annoying specific question is on your financing costs. I think they were about double
what they were last year; just if you could explain where that came from?
Secondly on other operating expenses, you went to $27 million from $17 million last year. Is
that essentially the new run-rate with the Cathedral incorporated? Was there any funnies
in there?
And in terms of the general question, I just wanted to know, looking at the renewals in
April, but also more specifically the ones that are coming up, I know everyone gives their
estimated price movements for contracts they wrote previously. But, of course, there's a
lot of judgment that goes into that because it's very difficult to quantify some of the
changes that are being made. Is there a particular pressure on any given terms and
conditions that you can identify that's a new trend or that's something that we should be
watching when, I guess, when others and when everyone reports their renewals or is it
pretty much just a top-line price game from here?

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

So do you want to start?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Sure. And hi. It's Elaine. I'll start on the financing costs. They're relatively stable quarter-onquarter, other than interest rate swaps we've got. So that's obviously subject to interest
rate movement. So if you take the subordinated debt that we have, the subordinated
debt that Cathedral has and the senior debt that we have, plus average our sea costs and
whatnot, then you probably get to about $4 million a quarter in terms of run rate. The
variation that you're seeing in this quarter is entirely driven by the mark-to-market on the
swap.
On the G&A, there's a few kind of funnies that come in this year just purely as a result of
the acquisition. We have a finite life intangible asset that we have to amortize, so there's
$4.4 million in our G&A this quarter that relates to that. And there will be slightly less than
that next quarter, and then less again in Q3, then we'll be finished with that one. So that
will be a bit of an anomaly this year, but as that tails off, we do expect the G&A ratio to
trend down.
If you're looking for kind of a run-rate G&A, we're obviously adding in one full quarter of
Cathedral's G&A on top of one full quarter of our G&A this time around as well. So if you
took last year's G&A for both of us and backed out a little bit for acquisition expenses that
we would both have incurred last year, then you probably got something that looks like a
reasonable run-rate. So I'd knock about $5 million off for us and about $5 million off for
Cathedral, just in terms of costs.

FINAL

Hi, it's Paul Gregory here. I think at the moment, in general, the main focus is on price, so
clients and brokers are aiming to get their costs down. And that applies across pretty
much all of our lines of business, as I've mentioned earlier. Particularly in the direct lines,
the focus is price as opposed to terms and conditions.
And there's a little bit on terms and conditions in areas of reinsurance, but again, the main
focus is getting the price of the product down. There are certain areas, such as increased
reinstatement options that are being looked at. But the main focus is price at the
moment. That's not to say that won't change as we move through the cycle, and level at
which people come in and buy reinsurance would be looked at. But at the moment, as I
said, price, rate online, are the main areas that are the focus points.

Our next question comes from Ben Cohen from Canaccord Genuity. Please go ahead with
your question.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Ben Cohen

{BIO 1541726 <GO>}

Hi. Thank you very much. I had two questions. The first was on capital requirements. I think
you indicated last year and I think with the fourth quarter results that you need about $1.6
billion of total capital. Does that still hold? Would you see that moving at all materially
through the course of the year?
And my second question was, the movement in earned premium in the first quarter, does
that give us a reasonable run-rate for the change that we should expect for the full year?
Thank you.

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Hi, Ben. It's Elaine. In terms of capital requirement, nothing's really changed. We put our
books together and everything's kind of shaken out more or less where we expected it to
be. So it's expected still to be sitting around that $1.6 billion for the rest of this year,
subject to anything that happens, obviously.
And in terms of the earned premium, we do have Cathedral's income statement in at the
back of our supplement. So you can combine – I mean, their debt book is fairly stable. So I
think, more or less whatever comes off in the reinsurance book in terms of pricing, we can
add it back in, in terms of energy and terror, and earn that out over the year. So the
earning pattern should be reasonably stable, other than the fact that there's a little bit
less reinsurance in there this time round.
And, again, ours, if you kind of back out the Accordion levels, then that should be about
your run rate. So the reason it's come down is entirely because we've just added on their

book of business into this quarter. And they do tend to write a bit more of their annual
book first quarter than we do. So that slowed us down a little bit. I'd expect we get back
to kind of about the 100% level by the end of the year.

Thanks for taking one last question from me. I just wanted to know, if you could remind
me again, in Kinesis, if you had a clean year, and also if you had an expected year, I guess,
the mean average year, what would the profit commission look like on the current AUM?

A - Alex Maloney

Hi. It's Alex here. It might be approximately about $5 million, maybe a little bit less on the

Our next question comes from Fossard from HSBC. Please go ahead with your question.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Two questions for me. The first one would be on Russia and
Ukraine. Does that create any tension on your political risk book? Is it something that you
are looking carefully at?
Second question would be for Elaine. On the attritional loss ratio, you indicated that the
28.4% in Q1 was a fairly good proxy for the attritional loss ratio going forward. But in the
press release, you indicated that the attritional sounds to be a bit – or to be running

slightly below the normalized run rate. So if you could be a bit more precise on what you
meant. And that's it, basically. Thanks.

FINAL

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Okay. So I'll take the first one. Yes, we do have exposure in Ukraine and Russia. We have
very little actually in Ukraine. We don't have a lot there at all. We, of course, have more in
Russia. We are monitoring that situation very closely. We currently haven't written $1 of
additional exposure for that book since the event happened, and it's unlikely we'll write
any more exposure to that event coming forward.
And obviously, the deals we write do amortize over time anyway, so any exposure we
have reduces over time. As I said, we're monitoring it closely. We're happy with our
market share. There's not that much more we can do, quite frankly, apart from not writing
any more new business at the moment.

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

In terms of the attritional loss ratio, I think, what we previously said was, before adding on
Cathedral, we're sitting around the 22%, 23%, and adding Cathedral into the mix brings us
really to that 25% attritional loss ratio. And just purely by price adjusting that, you get to
the 27%, 28% attritional ratio. And I think that's a good place to start. And so we'll see how
the rest of the year goes.
The comment in this quarter is really just getting at that, that's the kind of reasonable
level for an accident year loss ratio in the absence of any kind of significant cat events or
significant losses that there's always going to be little bits and pieces that come through,
and I think that's what you're seeing this quarter; nothing really other than the prior year
development that's really worth talking about.

question.

Q - Chris D. Hitchings

{BIO 2034501 <GO>}

Yes. I'm sorry, come back in. Just two very simple things. Just on your answer, Elaine, on
earned premium, surely one influence on earned premium is the multiyear contracts.
Presumably that's the main factor.
And secondly, a purely admin thing; I actually lost chunks of you before the bit you started
to repeat. And while it'll be lovely to hear you through all that again, it might be better, if
you simply circulated to all of us a script of Elaine's chat. Thanks.

FINAL

Yes, sure, no problem. I'm sure you don't want me to run through it all again. In terms of
multiyear contracts, we've got the benefit of energy multiyear contracts in 2012 and 2013
coming through. So the only thing pointed out in terms of the next part of that the older
ones run off in (41:17).

Q - Chris D. Hitchings

{BIO 2034501 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

In terms of the cat book, you're probably talking about $20 million worth of premium that
was written on a multiyear basis. We'll get $10 million of that this year and $10 million of
that next year, just roughly. It doesn't really have a huge impact.

We have another follow-up question from Frank Cawood (41:36). Please go ahead with
your question.
Yes. Again, just a little clarification, not so much from you as related to the other question
about the capital management, although it's unstated. I think typically, as you're in the
early part of the year, you would want to have a little more of a cushion because you're
coming into the hurricane season, which is your highest PML.
But if the hurricane season is fairly benign, then that turns out to be a little extra cushion at
the end of the year, allowing funds for repatriation to shareholders. So I guess your
strategy is exactly the same now as it has been for many years. Is that correct, Elaine and
others?

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Yeah. Exactly right, Frank (42:18). And I mean, we're obviously going to adjust it for the
market that we're in, but the underlying principles just don't really change very much.

Q - Operator
Good. I just want (42:26) on that because that's just the practicality of it. You need to have
that little extra as you're going into that and then coming out, if it's not bad, then you've
got some free cash that you can do different things with, so good.
Okay. There appear to be no further questions at this time.
