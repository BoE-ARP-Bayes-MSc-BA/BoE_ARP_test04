{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our
second quarter results. For AXIS, the story of the second quarter is that we continue to
see very encouraging performance and further evidence that our transformation efforts
and focus on market leadership are generating real traction. This was the second
consecutive quarter in which we delivered double digit ex-PGAAP operating ROE. The
integration of Novae into our business is progressing as planned and Novae's business is
delivering an underwriting profit.
We're also seeing progress with our transformation program to become more effective,
efficient and agile to position access for enhanced profitability under a wide range of
market conditions. While Pete will provide more detail on the numbers, I'd like to put our
results within the context of our transformation and provide you a sense of the
sustainability of our progress.
Through the hard work of our talented team, AXIS has evolved from an intelligent and
opportunistic provider of large capacity for volatile lines in what was once a hard market
to now becoming a profitable and leading player in attractive specialty lines markets. To
achieve this repositioning, we've concentrated our resources in both our insurance and
reinsurance operations on lines where we have the opportunity to be profitable market
leaders on the basis of our expertise, agility, service and strong mutually beneficial
relationships with key business partners.
Concurrently, we exited a number of lines where we did not see a path to leadership or
profitable growth. We've also invested in areas where we see exciting potential for
profitable growth including renewable energy, cyber, agriculture reinsurance and
mortgage reinsurance. We grew our geographical footprint and made targeted
acquisitions including Novae and Aviabel. We've empowered our underwriters with

Page 2 of 21

Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2018-07-26

stronger tools and made our business more customer-centric, committing to greater
engagement with our clients and partners in distribution.

FINAL

By the end of last year, these actions positioned AXIS as a relevant top 10 player in
substantially all of its chosen markets including U.S. E&S wholesale, North American
Professional Lines, and the London market for international specialty risks.
While much work remains, our efforts are building momentum. This quarter's results
provide some insights into the earnings potential of our progress to date. We reported
operating income of $106 million or $1.27 per share and operating ROE of 9.5% in the
quarter. But we believe this understates the true run rate profitability of our business due
to PGAAP adjustments. Pete will speak to how the net drag from PGAAP will substantially
runoff by midnight 2019. However, for now, adjusting for PGAAP, our second quarter
results would have been earnings per share of $1.43 with an ex-PGAAP operating ROE of
10.7%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Similarly, the six month results represent an ex-PGAAP operating ROE of 11.1%. As I also
emphasized during our last earnings call, this performance still does not reflect the full
benefit of the recent and ongoing underwriting actions on both the legacy AXIS and
Novae portfolios, nor the synergies we expect to achieve from the integration.
You'll recall we announced revised integration synergy projections of $50 million
(00:05:58) by year-end 2020. This quarter reflects $10 million of achieved synergies or
$40 million on an annualized basis. In addition, we've made good progress with regards
to the redesign of our operating model while reinvesting savings into our business to
provide better tools to our teams, enhance our ability to leverage data and analytics and
position the company to take advantage of change in the marketplace.
From an organizational design standpoint, we completed the realignment of our A&H
operations into the insurance and reinsurance segments, restructured our finance and IT
functions around an integrated organizational structure and are continuing to build out our
new global underwriting and analytics office.
Separately, our new Reinsurance CEO, Steve Arora has worked with the reinsurance
leadership team to establish a new structure for our reinsurance operations that will result
in greater engagement with our clients, a differentiated service offering that will deliver
innovative solutions and help us gain market leadership. These actions put access on a
strong path forward while improving our efficiency and profitability.
We continue to expect that our ongoing transformation will deliver net additional expense
reductions of $40 million by year-end 2020 even as we invest in our people and in our
business. Coupled with the $60 million in synergies from the integration of Novae, we
continue to project total expected cost savings of $100 million by year-end 2020.
As we close the first half of 2018, we're encouraged by the continued improvements in
our results as well as the progress we're making against our strategy. We see a clear

Page 3 of 21

runway to enhance profitability and remain committed to a journey that we believe will
provide substantial rewards to all our key stakeholders.

FINAL

And with that, I'll turn the call over to Pete who will go through the figures in more detail.

Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Thank you, Albert. Good morning, everyone. As Albert noted, the story of our second
quarter is that AXIS is continuing to see very encouraging results and further evidence that
our strategy is working. During the quarter, we generated net income of $93 million. Our
operating income for the quarter was strong at $106 million, generating an annualized
operating ROE of 9.5%.

Bloomberg Transcript

On an ex-PGAAP basis, our operating income was $120 million, generating an ex-PGAAP
annualized operating ROE of 10.7%. The quarter benefited from good underlying â€“
underwriting results, a low level of catastrophe of weather-related losses, continued
favorable prior-year reserve development and strong investment income. These positive
factors were partially offset by modest non-cat weather (00:08:52) property losses, net
unrealized and realized investment losses and amortization of value of business acquired
(VOBA) and intangible assets.
Before I get into specifics of the income statement, I'd like to provide an update on
several items. With regard to the acquisition of Novae, in the quarter we recognized
amortization of intangibles of $57 million including amortization of VOBA of $53 million.
This expense affected the company's consolidated operating income but was not
included in the segment results.
As previously disclosed, VOBA is expected to be immaterial beyond mid-2019. At June
30, $160 million or 62% of the pre-tax VOBA has been amortized. Underwriting income in
the quarter continued to include the earn-out of Novae's unearned premium as of the
closing date without the recognition of the associated acquisition costs since the DAC
asset was written off at closing.
We estimate that the consolidated acquisition costs on an as-if basis would have been
approximately $40 million higher, resulting in an acquisition cost ratio of 22.9% versus the
reported 19.6%, a difference of 3.3 points. The net drag on operating income from the
VOBA/DAC adjustments was $14 million after tax or approximately $0.16 per share. We
have added exhibits to both the press release and the supplement that detail this
information for you.
With respect to the integration of Novae and our transformation program, we still expect
to deliver $100 million in run rate savings by 2020, of which we recognized $10 million in
this quarter, up sequentially from $7 million in the first quarter of 2018. These savings were
essentially all related to the Novae integration. Non-operating reorganization expenses of
$19 million were recognized in the quarter, associated with our transformation program
and the integration of Novae.

Moving into the details of the consolidated income statement, the current quarter
consolidated combined ratio was 93.1%, an improvement of 4.5 points from the second
quarter of 2017. As I have mentioned earlier, it is important to note that the quarter
benefited from the absence of the amortization of some acquisition costs. The as-if
combined ratio of 96.4% is a 1.2 point better than the comparable period last year. The
more than 1.2 point improvement is driven by a 2.3 improvement in the current accident
year loss ratio ex-cat and weather, driven by business mix largely related to the addition
of the Novae book, favorable impact of rate over trend across a number of lines, partially
offset by non-cat/weather losses in the insurance property book and large loss
experience in the reinsurance book.
We reported favorable prior period development of $60 million in the quarter, of which
$24 million came from insurance and $36 million from reinsurance. This includes a
reduction in our estimates for the catastrophes of 2017. There was increase in the
acquisition cost ratio of 2.1 points, primarily driven by business mix associated with the
addition of the Novae book. There was a 1.9 point improvement in the cat and weather
loss ratio, and an improvement in G&A ratio. This was offset by a lower level of favorable
prior year reserve development.

Bloomberg Transcript

As we have stated before, the addition of the Novae book to the legacy AXIS book has
resulted in lower loss ratios or higher acquisition ratios due to the characteristics of the
Novae portfolio. During the second quarter, the consolidated G&A expense ratio of 13.9%
improved by 1.2 points compared to the second quarter of 2017. There were some timing
differences in the quarter, and a normalized ratio would have been 14.1%. Fee income
from strategic capital partners of $11 million was broadly consistent to the prior year.
As we will now discuss in detail, we're delivering more profitable underwriting in both
insurance and reinsurance. The insurance segment reported an increase in gross
premiums written of $262 million in the second quarter. The increase is mostly driven by
$291 million of premium associated with the acquisition of Novae. The legacy AXIS
insurance book decreased by $29 million or 4%. This decrease was primarily driven by a
decrease in property lines following our exit from the onshore energy business and the
retail U.S. P&C business. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in professional
lines, driven by new business across a number of business units. Insurance net premiums
written decreased by $102 million â€“ increased, I'm sorry, by $102 million compared to the
same period in 2017.
Excluding the impact of Novae, the net premiums written decreased in the quarter,
reflecting the decrease in gross premiums written, together with an increase in premiums
ceded in property and professional lines. The reported current quarter combined ratio
was 90.4%. Again, we think the best way to look at this ratio is adjusting for PGAAP. So
adjusting for $38 million of acquisition costs, the as-if combined ratio would be 97%, which
is almost a 4-point improvement over the same period last year.
The insurance segment current accident year loss ratio, ex-cat and weather, of 57.2%,
improved 3.6 points. The improvement was driven by mix of business largely related to
the Novae book, favorable rate over trend actions, and lower attritional loss experience in
liability and professional lines.

On the other hand, as we have seen across the industry, the quarter was hurt by an
unusual increase in the frequency of property losses. The insurance segment's acquisition
cost ratio on an asset basis was 22.3%, an increase of 7.4 points over prior year. The
increase was predominantly driven by the addition of the Novae book to the AXIS
portfolio. As we noted before, the Novae book has a lower loss ratio and a higher
acquisition cost ratio. Pre-tax catastrophe and weather-related losses were $23 million,
primarily attributable to weather events this quarter, compared to $41 million in the same
period in 2017.
The reinsurance segment reported an increase in gross premiums written of $26 million in
the second quarter. The increase is driven by $33 million of premium associated with the
acquisition of Novae. The legacy AXIS reinsurance book decreased by $7 million or 1%,
primarily attributable to a decrease in liability and catastrophe lines, partially offset by an
increase in credit/surety lines. Reinsurance net premiums written decreased by $58 million
compared to the same period in 2017. The decrease in net premiums written reflected
the decrease in legacy AXIS gross premiums written, together with an increase in the
premiums ceded in accident and health, catastrophe, and agriculture lines.

Bloomberg Transcript

The reported current quarter combined ratio was 90.7%. Again, we think the best way to
look at this ratio is adjusting for PGAAP. So adjusting for $2 million of acquisition cost, the
as-if combined ratio would be 90.9%, which is a 1.2 point improvement over the same
period last year.
The reinsurance segment's current accident year loss ratio ex-cat and weather of 65.5%
improved 0.6 point from 66.1%. The improvement was largely driven by rate over trend in
the motor and property books, offset by mix of business with a benefit of the lower loss
ratio in the Novae book was offset by higher motor premiums, which carry a higher
attrition loss ratio, as well as a modest increase in non-cat/weather losses.
The reinsurance segment's acquisition cost ratio on an as-if basis was 23.4% (00:17:24), a
decrease of 1.8 points over the prior year. This was primarily driven by loss sensitive
features. Pre-tax catastrophe and weather-related losses were $15 million, primarily
attributable to U.S. weather-related events in the quarter. This was compared to $9 million
reported during the same period in 2017.
I would like to provide some insight on our new cat covers that were put into place in May.
Our new covers, which utilize both the traditional and ILS reinsurance markets, bring our
PMLs back on the similar levels we reported prior to our acquisition of Novae, with a
better balance of frequency and severity protection.
Our covers cross all of our peak zones and event types around the globe. As a quick
example of how our cat protection has improved, we would see an approximate $100
million reduction or approximately 15% to 20% decrease in retained losses from the 2017
hurricanes under our new covers.
We think that protecting our capital is critical, but when components of enhanced earnings
protection are available at economically attractive levels, it's prudent to leverage those

opportunities. Net investment income of $110 million for the quarter was comparable to
$106 million in the second quarter of 2017, with an increase in income from fixed maturities
securities attributable to a larger investment base from the acquisition of Novae and
Aviabel and an increase in interest rates. This was partially offset by a decrease in income
from alternative investments attributable to credit funds returns, which were negatively
impacted by the weakening of the euro against the U.S. dollar.
Diluted book value per share declined by 0.10 point (00:19:10) in the quarter to $52.47,
principally driven by net realized and unrealized losses on investments.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Albert.

Thank you, Pete. I'll spend a few minutes reviewing market trends, and then we'll open
the call for questions. We continue to see an improved pricing environment. In insurance,
the average rate change in the quarter was almost 4% across the entire book. While this
is less than the 5% increase observed in the first quarter, I would note that two-thirds of
the delta is due to business mix renewed in the respective quarters. Specifically, property
lines, which have experienced stronger increases, made up a much larger percentage of
renewals in the first quarter.
Our average rate change year to date was over 4% across the insurance book. Within our
U.S. insurance division, we achieved average rate change of over 7% in the second
quarter, as compared to more than 11% in the first quarter. We continue to see doubledigit improvement in both E&S property and excess casualty, while primary casualty and
programs were up in the mid-single digits.
Our average rate change year-to-date was over 9% in the U.S. P&C book. In our Londonbased international insurance division, the average rate change for the second quarter
was a bit over 3%, as compared to 4% in the first quarter. While a number of lines
exhibited smaller rate increases in the second quarter, there were still many lines showing
positive momentum. Encouragingly, 89% of business renewed at flat or better terms in
the quarter.
Our average year-to-date price change was close to 4% in our international division, with
specialty lines increases about 1 point stronger than professional lines. Within our U.S.
professional lines division, market conditions are stable with about 1% increase in average
rates, consistent with our experience in the first quarter.
As usual, primary lines are stronger than excess layers. Strongest was primary D&O
reacting to elevated industry loss activity in that line. And I would note that we're not a
major underwriter of primary public D&O. Across all insurance lines and geographies,
we're continuing to focus our efforts on growing our business, where we see
opportunities for profitable growth. We remain aggressive in pushing price where it's
warranted. As I noted last quarter, this has resulted in lower retention ratios, but our
emphasis is on profits, not volume.

FINAL

Turning to the reinsurance market, conditions are generally following the positive trends in
primary lines. In many cases, quota share treaties are renewed at lower ceding
commissions. However, pricing for excess of loss treaties is more subdued as excess
capacity remains a challenge. In our Europe, Middle East and Africa division, the market is
improving modestly and at a slow pace. Pricing was generally flat in the second quarter,
with some pockets of improvement in liability and motor.
In our North American reinsurance division, pricing was also relatively flat â€“ excuse me.
We're seeing improved performance among our regional and middle market accounts.
Ceding commissions are generally flat to down, although we still see certain players
hungry to grow at expiring ceding commissions. The property market remains challenging,
as rates continue to be at levels that we believe are unsustainable. In Asia, we're seeing
improved profitability but based on our own underwriting actions.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the other hand, pricing for catastrophe lines written out of Bermuda was
disappointing, particularly the Florida renewals. Even some loss-affected accounts were
able to renew flat. Overall, the Florida renewal was completed at an average rate change
in the low single-digits in large part due to the strong appetite shown by the collateralized
reinsurance market.
As to our own portfolio, overall, in both insurance and reinsurance, conditions are still
moving in the right direction. While in the prior quarter, I advised that that rate was ahead
of trend on a written basis, this quarter, rate was also ahead of trend on an earned basis,
leading to a small favorable impact in the loss ratio. We're hopeful to see this trend
continue into future periods. I'm cautiously optimistic on the outlook despite excess
capacity, as some leading indicators point towards further discipline. We continue to
believe that stresses in the market are such that more improvement is inevitable.
I'm encouraged by recent actions such as Lloyd's compelling syndicates to address
unprofitable business, the increasing number of carriers exiting lines or markets and the
significant Re underwriting and costing (00:24:28) programs announced across our
industry. I see these developments as signs that management teams are recognizing that
in a world of excess capacity, we must take control of our own profitability rather than wait
for some mythical market turn. What this tells me is that improvements in results will not
be generalized across the industry, but rather limited to companies with the discipline,
commitment, and talents to make the right decisions and follow through with the required
actions.
I'm confident AXIS is one of those companies. While we have plenty of work ahead of us,
we have a head start as we've been on this journey for some time now, and we're
showing encouraging results. I'm bullish about our prospects. We continue to execute on
our strategy, and our core underwriting results are improving as we exit unprofitable
business and increase our relevance in attractive lines, where we can hold leadership
positions. We're also just beginning to see the results from our acquisition of Novae,
which has strengthened our position in a number of markets.

Our differentiated market positioning, underwriting actions, and progress along the
targeted $100 million of cost savings by 2020 provide a clear path to continued improved
performance and superior results for our stakeholders.

FINAL

And with that, we'd be happy to answer your questions. Operator, please open the lines.

Q&A
Operator
We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Elyse
Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. First off, I just have to say, I do appreciate all the additional disclosure
that you guys provided in the press release and supplement this quarter, so thanks for
that. My first question, on the 2017 hurricanes, Pete, you mentioned that there were some
takedown on the losses. Can you quantify that, and how much was that from insurance
and reinsurance? And then some other players in the space have seen a pickup in losses,
especially in Florida with reopened claims for Irma. Have you guys observed that, and was
that originally reserved for in your current estimates?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yeah. Elyse, we had $60 million in favorable prior period development. Of that, $31 million
was related to the 2017 catastrophes. And of that $31 million, $17 million came from
insurance and $14 million came from reinsurance. I'd say overall, we're very comfortable
with our reserve levels as they are; we're looking at the storms in total. And just to add
some color, I'd say, we just saw a slight uptick in Irma, but we saw some significant
reductions coming from the other storms.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. And then in the segments, you had pointed to, I think, in both insurance
and reinsurance, non-cat/weather losses in both of the segments. Can you quantify the
impact? And then since there is a lot more â€“ the seasonality is a little bit different in terms
of the margins, would you expect...

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yeah.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

...with the Novae deal â€“ sorry â€“ would you expect sequential improvement in the segments
in the back half of the year? And maybe that's more of an insurance versus reinsurance
question.

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah. Let's take the two segments, Elyse. On the reinsurance side, we really didn't see a
lot of what would I call non-cat/weather property coming out of the reinsurance side. It
was actually focused in a couple other areas there. However, on the insurance side, we
really did see an uptick in that non-cat/weather-related stuff. I would put it at about on the
insurance loss ratio, probably about 3 to 4 points, Elyse, more than we expected to see in
the quarter.
Sequentially, again, we don't see a trend in this. So, with all the underwriting actions we've
been doing on our property class as well as the sequentiality of the seasonality, I would
suggest that we should see â€“ we are expecting to see that improve over the next coming
quarters.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay, great. And then in terms of the â€“ your net gross (00:29:00) fell to 61% in the
quarter. You guys highlighted a lot more reinsurance that you've been purchasing. Is that
about like the run rate that we should model going forward, or will it be lower going
forward, just any color there?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yeah. Again, Elyse, I'd take a look at that and split it between the two segments. On the
reinsurance side, there were some â€“ I'd call it one-time transactions in the second quarter,
as well as some catch-up for some treaties, like our backdated 1/1. So on the reinsurance
side, I think if you're going to look at a ceding percent, looking at the year-to-date number
would be a better way to look at it. And on the insurance side, you had a ceding
percentage of about 42% in the quarter. We did put as part of our reinsurance buying
(00:29:48) a new quota share treaty in place on some of our property book. So that is
probably a pretty good number on a go-forward basis for the insurance side.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay, great. And one last question. You guys highlighted on still the $100 million of cost
saves you expect to come out by 2020. So is the right way to think about that that we
should take about the $700 million of pro forma G&A that you guys had set for 2017 for
the two companies, and just think that $100 million will come out of that number when we
get to 2020?

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yeah. I would suggest that we're looking at this two ways, Elyse. One is on the absolute
dollar basis and the other is on a ratio basis. But if you start with the $700 million and you
take $100 million off of that, that's a good start. But I would suggest that there will be
some inflationary pressures on the rest of the expenses by the time we get to 2020. I
expect those inflationary pressures to be more than offset by our ability to put new
business and additional growth on the book in an efficient manner to not have to grow
that the rest of the expense base.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Thank you and good morning. My first question on premium growth is, is it (00:31:11) down
about 20% in each of your business on constant currency basis and ex-Novae, part of that
probably is ceding commission. Could you talk a little bit more about the premium gross
trends, and I understand you repositioned your portfolio, but will that â€“ sort of are you
more careful in term of what you write, or we expect go into two possible growth
(00:31:34) going forward?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I think what you're saying is optimization of our portfolio, and we're continuing to do that. I
think that obviously, we were very happy to see significant growth that came through to us
both from the Novae acquisition, as well as in individual lines of business. But some of
those changes that you've seen are a reflection of actions that we've already announced.
So, the exit that we announced from onshore energy at the end of last year is, in large
part, driving what you're seeing in the reduction in the legacy AXIS portfolio.
In the reinsurance portfolio, there were a loss of a couple of treaties, and there was, as
you saw in our notes, some timing issues both with regard to pushing a renewal of a large
casualty treaty, as well as writing less multiyear treaties. So I wouldn't read into these
numbers anything new. As I said, we've already indicated the driver of the reduction in
insurance, but by and large, we are happy with where our book is; we will continue to
optimize the portfolio. We're not afraid to walk away from business if it doesn't meet the
returns we want, but we're also seeing some nice opportunities, and then we expect that
that will drive some new growth opportunities for us.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

But just to clarify, those reposition or optimization of the portfolio when run (00:33:00)
through the rest of the year, and then next year you are starting for â€“ sort of like on
comparable basis, what will be probably more growth trajectory?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I think generally that's right. But what I can't tell you is what the opportunities will be at the
moment. As you know, I'd say that our job is to optimize our portfolio at each opportunity.
But my expectation is that today we are a stronger company upfront. We have more

relevance, better relationship with our producers, we have more commitment around the
lines that â€“ where we are a leader and profitable. We've made some nice investments in
lines that have strong growth potential, including cyber, including non â€“ sorry â€“ renewable
energy.
I think the efforts that Steve and the Reinsurance team are doing on the reinsurance side
should provide us with more opportunities. So, we're on the front foot. We're looking to
grow, but we will make the right decisions based on the opportunities that we see in the
market.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you for that. And then (00:34:01) you mentioned U.S. professional line,
maybe there are some hot spots, but in general, where do you see the inflation trend
relative to your expectation? Which area you should be sort of like most concerned
about?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Actually, we're spending a fair amount of time monitoring every single one of these lines
of business. I would tell you that if there's one area that we are looking at, and which in
fact is impacting our appetites today, it's in the excess casualty in the U.S. We think that
there is real inflation there. We're very cautious about low levels of excess, because we
think that with recent inflation, the frequency of penetration into low excess layers should
be higher, and we don't believe that pricing is fully reflecting that yet. So we're very
cautious in that area.
To us, that's probably the one that I worry about the most, or that we're focusing on the
most. I would say that in every other line of business, we're not surprised with what we
see. We're not surprised with what we're seeing in the primary layers of D&O. And as I
noted in my prepared remarks, we've exited substantially most of the primary D&O
markets, so the inflation that we're seeing there is not affecting us, and the performance
in the excess layers continue to be good.
There, in the past, have been one or two risks that have given us a loss, but we don't see
anything systemic there. We don't see any real issues around the property lines generally.
Obviously, motor axle (00:35:37) was an issue in Europe, in particular the UK last year, but
the pricing has certainly addressed that, and we're actually pleased with the pricing we're
seeing on the motor axle (00:35:46). So I would say, by and large, things are looking
good. As I mentioned, rate is ahead of trend now on both a written and an earned basis,
and we're making sure that we're reacting properly, in particular in U.S. excess casualty.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Great. Last one, if I may, on capital management, you're achieving like double-digit
earning ROE in the last two quarters. You're going to generate $100 million cost savings
through the next couple years. I just wonder, in term of your capital (00:36:17) position,
when do we expect the share buybacks will return?

FINAL

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

That is perfectly tied to your first question, which is where the growth opportunity is going
to be next year. So to the extent that we see significant growth opportunities, that might
reduce the amount of buybacks that we'll be looking to do. If we see less growth
opportunities, then obviously that will increase the amount, but as you know, we look at
share repurchases on an annual basis based on the plan and our positioning, and I think as
we get closer to evaluating 1/1 conditions and our plan, we'll be giving guidance at that
point.

The next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. Please go ahead.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yes, thanks. I got a couple questions for you. First, I'm just curious, UK primary motor
insurance prices have actually been coming down pretty substantially. Does that all impact
to your reinsurance business, how do we think about that?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Well, we have both primary and excess of loss. So, they're affected on a pricing basis
differently. Most of the primary quota share business that we write tends to be on a
sliding scale basis. So we tend to target a fixed technical ratio. And by and large, our
experience tends to be very close to that fixed technical ratio, so we don't see much
there.
With regards to the excess, we absolutely have been achieving pricing increases, in some
cases, 30%, 35%, 40%. Through the second quarter, we've now seen the second renewal
post-Ogden, so you'll recall, we started to see pricing increases in the second quarter of
2017, and those treaties have now renewed in 2018, and we've seen prices hold. So we
continue to believe that the UK motor axle (00:38:18) business is now back to where we
want it to be.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great. And then just curious on the A&H business, growth slowed down from the first
quarter. Is that something we should see here kind of continuing going forward?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Well, we certainly continued to see growth. We're very excited about what we are doing.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yeah.

FINAL

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

So I think that reinsurance growth in A&H was strong. The reason it was less strong in
insurance is that we're seeing good growth in the U.S., but not so in Europe. So, we're
seeing less opportunities for us in Europe in A&H, and that's what's affecting it. But other
than that, I will say, the team's done a great job of kind of repositioning themselves within
our insurance and reinsurance segments, and they're continuing to engage with the
market, and I'm continuing to expect both continued growth and continued improvement
in underwriting results for A&H operations.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great. Great. And then just last question, just going back on the expense, maybe you can
just remind us here, initiatives. Are we expecting that some of these savings is going to
be reinvested back in the business? So is there kind of like an underlying kind of expense
growth number that we should be thinking of, call it, 3%, 4% with inflation that'll kind of
offset some of this $100 million that'll be coming through?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Well, to Pete's points earlier, absolutely. So if you were to take...

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yes.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

...the $700 million down to $600 million, you would expect that that $600 million would be
growing by inflation no matter what. But I will say that the $100 million that we announced
is net of additional investments that we're making in the business, so we're actually
targeting gross savings in excess of $100 million. We intend to allocate a good chunk of
those savings in our business in developing our staff, in new tools, and the $100 million is
what we're targeting on a net basis.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Very helpful. And then lastly, just curious on the additional reinsurance that you guys
bought to the quarter, understand some to excess, some is â€“ is some quota share. Should
we consider that margin â€“ accretive margin neutral, or does it hurt margin at least initially?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Well, from our perspective, it's ROE accretive, which is really what matters.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Right.

The big change for us is that last year, we bought a lot of event cover, but we didn't buy
aggregate cover. And this year, we have both events cover and aggregate cover. So we
think it's a much more balanced book of business, I mean, reinsurance protection.

The next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. Please go ahead.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Great. Thanks. Good morning. Albert...

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Morning.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

...just a couple of quick questions. One, if I understand your comment correctly, the
insurance pricing excluding business and exchanges (00:41:16) slowed down a little bit,
and I guess my question is, should we be concerned at all that it didn't accelerate?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I'm not sure that concerned is the right word, because I think what we're dealing with is an
environment with a fair amount of excess capacity. What I am seeing is that where pricing
is warranted, it's happening. So there's a real clear correlation in our book with where are
we getting increases and where do we think we need them. So, I think the market is, in my
mind, behaving in a rational way. We never expected strong double-digit across the board
increases. But as I mentioned to you, I do believe that we're going to continue to see
pricing increases.
And frankly, if this industry can deliver mid-single-digit increases, two, three, four years in a
row, color me happy, because that's a good way of doing it. Where it's necessary, and you
see that in E&S, we're continuing to see double-digit earnings growth, in U.S. casualty,
excess casualty, that's had some issues around motor business and other factors, we're
seeing double-digit rate increases. So we're getting the rate increases where we need
them. And as I mentioned, on the specialty side in London, I would say a third of the lines
actually showed higher rate increases in the second quarter than in the first quarter.
(00:42:55)

... place excess concern (00:42:57).

FINAL

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. No, that's perfect. Thanks. That clarified things a lot. And second, I'm trying to
understand the thought process, where we're seeing heightened, I guess, litigation
activity or social inflation in some professional lines. When you're not seeing it in particular
products, but you're seeing it in what might be adjacencies that have similar exposures,
how do you evaluate the possibility that â€“ I don't know â€“ lawyers that are targeting large
(00:43:30) will target other professional liability lines?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I think it's something that we do as part of our study of our markets. So it's â€“ one of the
nice things that you should always be looking at is what kind of seminars are lawyers
giving to other lawyers about what the new trend is. That's always a good indicator of
where you're going to see some trends grow. We're obviously looking at a number of
factor, including increasing litigation funding, which might give certain lawyers more
courage to pursue cases. Those kinds of things, we incorporate in our pricing and
reserving.

Bloomberg Transcript

And as you know, our practice has been, for as long as I remember, to incorporate in our
pricing and reserving loss cost trends that are over the longer term, which certainly have
been higher than what they've been recently. So we continue to reflect for that in using
what we consider to be prudent loss cost trends to each line of business.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay, that makes sense. Thank you very much.

Okay. The next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Yes, thank you. Albert, I was listening to your comments about the reinsurance purchasing
you called as kind of one-time in nature. Why wouldn't you be making the same type of
purchases next year, and were there any retrospective or loss portfolio transfers done in
this purchasing?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I think I'm not sure that I recall the context of the one-time in nature.

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

I think we did mention, Josh, on our reinsurance side, we did do a special fronting deal,
that showed up as reinsurance. That was just a specific deal, Josh, that I would suggest is

Page 16 of 21



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2018-07-26

not part of our core purchasing of reinsurance. I'd say what we'd purchase on a core
basis, you can see us continue to look at on a go-forward basis.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

FINAL

(00:45:27) if I'm thinking about 2Q 2019, is this going to recur one year from today?

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

No. I mean, I can't tell you; that just happened to be a one-off specific opportunistic deal
that we did in the reinsurance side. They come and go as they show themselves in the
market, but I wouldn't say you're going to see it again in second quarter of 2019. There's
nothing specific about it.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Yeah, look, this is â€“ precisely, this is a third-party capital partner of ours...

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yeah.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

...that had an opportunity to do something, and we're very happy to help them. Obviously,
in a broad $2.5 billion reinsurance portfolio, we're going to have a few transactions up and
down. But to your point, Josh, to the extent that we find continuing attractive
opportunities to purchase reinsurance, we will certainly do so. There may not â€“ we may
not renew every single one of those transactions.
I will tell you, we did do one transaction in the quarter that had a retrospective or
retroactive nature to it. It was actually a small transaction between ourselves and
Harrington. And the reason for doing that frankly was for us to build the muscle memory
around creating LPT expertise within ourselves and Harrington as an opportunity to offer
that as a product going forward. But we did not need to â€“ within AXIS to make any
purchases of retroactive reinsurance.

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yeah, I was going to mention that, Josh. We did do an LPT between ourselves and
Harrington Re in the quarter, that all occurs on the balance sheet, so that didn't affect the
ceded premium written or anything like that. So it doesn't â€“ that didn't affect any of the
ratios you may be looking at.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. And can you just give a little complexion around the nature of the European market
versus the U.S. market? Are they generally equivalent, or do you think the U.S. market has
better opportunities going forward, or where do you think geographically the
opportunities lie?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I think we find attractive opportunities in both markets. So I will tell you that right now,
obviously, we feel that the liability and the motor business in Europe is good for us, and so
we've been growing that. I think in the U.S., we like what we're doing in surety, we like
what we're doing in regional and middle market accounts. We still need to see more work
certainly in professional lines and liability. We've spoken about that. So I think what we're
doing is we're focusing not simply on the lines of business, but increasingly on our core
accounts.
And as you may recall, we announced this in late May, part of our redesign of the
reinsurance is to add our global specialty division, which will include strategic partners,
focus on strategic partners, which are top accounts. So we're going to be focusing very
hard to ensure that we provide a broad range of treaties and services to our larger
accounts. So it's not just geography, not just lines, but it's also around enhancing the value
of our top relationships on the reinsurance side.

Okay. The next question comes from Ian Gutterman with Balyasny. Please go ahead.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Hi, thank you. Most of mine were asked. So I'd just follow up, Albert, on Kai's question
when you discussed excess liability and avoiding the lower excess, because I presume
because of the defense costs risk as we're seeing, litigation pressure, I guess my
question is, what about the flipside of that, which is, it seems we're also seeing more
severity in cases. So, I would think going up high also poses risk, because you obviously
get less premium, and if we see some of these massive verdicts (00:49:37) continue, the
whole tower goes down, so you get less premium for essentially the same loss. So, how
do you evaluate â€“ I understand why you won't' want to be low, but isn't there also in this
environment risk to being high?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Yeah, but that's why we have underwriters. I mean, they're focusing...

Sure.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

FINAL

...on these issues. But bottom line, 10 years ago, excess casualty attach was at $1 million
(00:50:02). Today, excess casualty attach is at $1 million. It ain't the same world.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Okay. Sure.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

We think excess casualty should attach to $2 million or $3 million. And so I think that if
you're pricing it and you're looking at it the same way, you're going to get a lot more
frequency and severity in that early layer than you would have had 10 years ago, and we
just think that either it should be priced properly, or we should push ourselves a little bit
further up.

Bloomberg Transcript

I fully agree with you with the concept of where do you want to be if a loss is going to hit
the entire tower, you might as well get more premium for that. But as I said, I'm very, very
proud of the talent that we have in our underwriting staff and they do a really good job of
identifying where in the tower they feel most comfortable in terms of risk and return. But
my comment was really about the fact that we need to attach more like at $2 million, $3
million, $4 million before we â€“ to get the same kind of risk return that we used to have at
$1 million.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

And I assume part of that is because of defense costs creep?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Yeah, defense costs creep and just social inflation.

Hi. Yes. I had a follow-up question on investment income. So, Pete, you had alluded to
they're not being one-timers, I guess, away from alternative portfolio in the quarter, but
your fixed â€“ your investment income was actually up about 16% year-over-year if you back
out the other investments, also up nicely sequentially. So is the Q2 level, I guess,
(00:51:47) is that the right investment income to think about modeling going forward?

A - Peter J. Vogt

{BIO 17059745 <GO>}

Yeah. I guess I'd give you a couple facts there, Elyse. Our book yield on a fixed income is
up to 2.8% in the second quarter. I mean, sequentially, that's up from 2.7% in the first
quarter, and our new money yield right now is 3.4%, and in Q1, it was at 3.2%. So, all
directions on the fixed income portfolio are trending a bit higher.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

Okay. So if anything, sequentially, we might continue to see uptick in the investment
income from here?
