Thank you, Christian. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and a very warm welcome
from me as well. I'm very pleased to be talking to you in my new capacity as group's CFO
for the first time. I've already met quite a few of you, as you know, and I'm looking forward
to getting to know all of you personally and to working with analysts and investors more
closely in the future.
Today, I'm very happy to present the financial result which is strong and fully in line with
our expectations. In reinsurance, our underlying profitability was sound. And in primary
insurance, we are well on track with ERGO Strategy Programme. With net income of
around €2.3 billion, we reached the middle of our target range. This was despite an
environment that poses significant challenges for the insurance industry as a whole
especially in the fourth quarter.
In Q4, we did well despite intense claims activity and adverse capital market
developments. A net profit of €238 million benefited from strong performance in our life
and health reinsurance, and ERGO earnings, that were also above expectations. The
accumulation of major losses left its mark on the P&C reinsurance result but this was
mitigated by our healthy balance sheet.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our capitalization remains sound and provides a strong basis for ongoing high
shareholder payouts. The dividend is proposed to be at €9.25 per share which underlines
our confidence in Munich Re's earnings power going forward.
Let's now look at the investment results. Given the high capital market volatility in the
fourth quarter, the ROI of 2.9% is quite decent. Regular income proved to be resilient and
amounted to 2.9%. Significant equity impairments were offset by gains on disposals of
equity investments and the net positive contribution from derivatives. The ROI of 2.8% for
the full year 2018 is more or less in line with our guidance of approximately 3%.
Let me now give you the highlights by business segment. In life and health reinsurance,
the technical result plus fee income came in strong at €165 million in Q4. The full year
number of €584 million clearly surpasses our guidance of €475 million. Overall, we can say
2018 was a remarkably good year. It is worth noting the very good claims experience in
the U.S. which was counterbalanced in part by the ongoing adverse development in
Australia.
In P&C reinsurance, the combined ratio of 99.4% is close to our original full year target of
99%. Q4 was impacted though by heavy outlier loss activity. Major losses in Q4 mainly nat
cats like the Californian wildfires, the Japanese typhoons, and Hurricane Michael in the
U.S., as well as a series of man-made claims were partially offset by one-offs for claims in
prior years that amounted to 4.6 percentage points of net earned premiums for the full
year. This again underlines our cautious reserving factors also for single large losses.
Basic loss reserve releases net of commission effects were 4.6 percentage points for the
full year, which is slightly above our guidance for 2018. In absolute terms, the release
equals the level of 2017. We continue to follow our prudent reserving approach to react
immediately to any signs of deterioration, while allowing positive indications to develop

FINAL

more gradually. We consider our reserving situation to be as strong as it was as at the
yearend 2017.
On a normalized basis, the combined ratio amounts to approximately 100% for the full
year according to our usual and I must say somewhat simplified calculation method.
However, we believe that the underlying combined ratio has been quite consistent with
our guidance of around 99% for 2018. ERGO exceeded the guidance with a net profit of
€412 million for the full year. Even in adjusting for net positive one-off effects, its financial
development turned out to be significantly better than anticipated at the beginning of
2018.
At 97.9%, the combined ratio in German P&C business was relatively high in Q4, driven by
our again prudent reserving approach and the cost ratio, which reflects ongoing high
expenses for various projects designed to sustainability enhance the value of the
business.
For the full year however, the combined ratio of 96% fully meets our guidance. The
combined ratio of ERGO International amounted to 94.5% in Q4. At 94.6%, the combined
ratio for the full year even beats the ambitious 96% target that we amended – or that we
have amended from 97% at the beginning of the year. The full year 94.6% came in as a
historical low.

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, that's all for now from my side. In my view, these figures underline again the inherent
strength of Munich Re. We'll provide us, as you know, the final results at our analyst
conference call on March 20.
And with that, thank you all for listening from my side and I'll hand it over to Torsten for
comments on the January renewals.

Torsten Jeworrek

{BIO 5724439 <GO>}

Thank you, Christoph, and a very good morning to all of you. I am on slide 6 of the
presentation and I would like to lead you through the January renewals. Overall, I would
say we reached a very satisfactory outcome in a very and unchanged difficult market
environment.
When you look at our portfolio premium wise, volume wise, the renewal in January is a
very important one because when you look at the non-life business here on this slide, €20
billion, then the business which was up for renewal contributes approximately 50% to all
our non-life business.
When you only take the treaty business which has these three renewal dates in the year,
then the contribution premium wise it's already 66%. In terms of the portfolio
composition, this business which was up for renewal in January has of course as we know
from the past only a minor cat share in the portfolio.

FINAL

So that means and in other words those treaties in the United States and Japan which
heavily were affected by the large loss events which were mentioned by Christoph
before. Those treaties were not really in the focus of the last renewal in January now and
that will to some extent also explain why we have not seen more significant price
increases in January.
I start with some market environment. The market after these very large losses in Q3 and
Q4, according to our observation, remains very much unchanged, that means that
traditional reinsurance capacity stayed in the market and here is a bit more uncertainty of
the alternative capital that plays a role in the market where they used to be before in the
United States.

Bloomberg Transcript

Regarding alternative capital, we see more uncertainties in their behavior in the – in their
capacity they provide for the market. Our explanations are, this is second year in a row
that alternative capital is affected which is kind of new lesson for the capital providers.
Maybe another explanation is that they wrote a lot of business under the assumption that
that business is exposed to cat business on the East Coast, maybe to earthquake to
some extent, but many of the aggregate covers in the United States, this year or last year
also affected by the wildfires which were from their perspective more of an unexpected
loss they have to deal with and because we have now two years in a row more capital
than originally assumed remained locked in that needs to participate in the new
underwriting years, the capital providers have to reinstate – refill the capital base for the
business because their treaties are collateralized.
When I look at the various regions in the world, United States, Europe, Southeast Asia,
global business, then in this competitive environment, the markets remained rational, I
would say. Rational in the sense that those treaties and programs which were affected by
losses particularly in the United States saw reasonable rate increases in the order of, I
would say, up to 10% or so particularly, the cat treaties and equipment treaties (00:10:39).
Treaties and programs in other regions not affected by larger losses were more or less
flat or particularly, in Europe and Southeast Asia, saw price reductions, small price
reductions, but price reductions.
And when you look at the primary insurance business in the United States, here we could
benefit from an improving underlying market. There were rate changes in many lines of
business in the United States which, of course, helped us already now in the proportional
business and will help us further in the year for our period business which has not a
specific renewal date, and we don't report that separately. In the United States, in Europe,
and in Asia proportional business remained pretty much flat, I would say.
I'll switch to the next slide, slide number 7, where you see our traditional chart where we
present our portfolio. Left side is the old portfolio which was up for renewal. On the right
side is the new portfolio. And all the figures which you see here are adjusted for currency
changes, and we started with a portfolio of €9.4 billion and could achieve a premium
increase, volume increase of 6.3%, bringing us to €10 billion in total, which is good. And on
the other hand, it reflects that I think we behaved rational and responsibly in this renewal.

FINAL

Taking everything together, price changes, positive price changes in United States, more
pressure in Europe and Southeast Asia, our price change according to our calculation was
flat, was 0%, and this 0% include exposure changes and higher risk. So, that means when
we take higher risk, and we did, we got higher premiums for that. But it does exclude a
positive impact from higher interest rates which we generate on the asset side, and it
does exclude our positive impact from our internal cost reduction program.
So, all in all, I would say a good result under these circumstances. What does it mean
now? It will positive contribute to our earnings in 2019. We have then two more renewal
dates in front of us. One is Japan in April. The other one is July, Caribbean and United
States, mainly. And for these renewal dates, because of the larger contribution of the cat
business in the States, we of course do expect a more positive and more significant price
increases, all taking into account the bad loss experienced (00:13:53) in the last two years.
With this in mind, I would like to finish and hand over to Christian Becker-Hussong.

Thank you, gentlemen, for your introductory remarks.

Bloomberg Transcript

We are now happy to take your questions. So, please feel free. As always, I would like to
ask you to limit the number of your questions to a maximum of two per person. Thank
you.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you, sir. Our first question today comes from James Shuck from Citi. Please go
ahead.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. So, my two questions. Firstly, I'm really just looking for some
clarification around the outlook for realized gains particularly as we look forward to the
2020 targets. Now, I tend to think about realized gains net of write-ups and write-downs
and excluding ERGO Life because most of those are shared with policyholders, in any
case. It looks like that number was a reasonably low number in 2018. I'm just interested in
when you look out to 2020, what should we be expecting in terms of a absolute number
for realized gains net of write-downs? It looks like it should be around the €500 million
level. That's about 20%, 25% of your net profit. So, it's an important number when you
think about achieving that 2.8%. I'm just keen to understand how confident you are in
being able to realize that kind of level on an ongoing basis, please.
Second question was around the January renewals. So, flat pricing, volume up 6%. I
presume the structured and tailored transactions have not been a big contributor this
year. When I look at the mix between the new business and the canceled business, it
Page 5 of 23



Company N ame: M uenchener Rueckversicherungs-Gesellschaft AG in M uenchen
Company Ticker: M UV2 GR Equity
Date: 2019-02-06

FINAL

seems that there's been – certainly versus last year, there's been a big improvement or
reduction in the cancellation rate versus last year which has helped, but there's also been
a big reduction in the volume of new business, so your new business has gone from €2.3
billion to just €0.9 billion. Just looking for a little bit of an explanation about the lack of
growth from that side, please. Thank you.

A - Christoph Jurecka

Well, thank you for the question. Christoph here. Your question was the outlook for
realized gains, and maybe I answer that question right away in more general terms. As
you know, we are discussing today our preliminary results and our usual calendar would
say that we are talking about the outlook and our further development towards 2020 and
beyond potentially in our March conference. Therefore, even if your question is very
specific as it is, I would rather refrain from answering it now and would like to postpone
that for our March conference.

{BIO 5724439 <GO>}

January renewal, our portfolio remained pretty stable this year, meaning difference to last
year, there was hardly or no contribution from tailor-made large or structured transaction
of our portfolio. They were included last year in our figures. So, pretty unspectacular
renewal, I would say. In terms of business mix, we expect and see a slight change towards
more casualty business in this renewal. So, that has to do with some proportional business
which we wanted to write. But on a, let's say, basis which was responsible in my opinion,
we intentionally decided not to participate or not to entertain to write some large
business particularly in the United States this year which were placed and we were aware
of covering a lot of, let's say, I would say, commercial liability and commercial motor
business because here we have a more careful approach.
You might have read this article in one of the newspapers recently where we decided
intentionally to reduce our appetite for that business for reserve reasons. We see more
negative patterns in that market. But otherwise, I would say pretty unchanged renewal in
most of the business which we had in the portfolio are still in place and only limited
opportunities going forward.
The higher share of casualty business will, of course, mean that we do expect more
investment income from interest rates from the cash flow of the – and to longer duration
of that piece of business which is not included in our reported price change of that
renewal.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

And Torsten, just to be clear, then so the – you're saying you wrote no tailored and
structured tractions in 2019 whereas you wrote the fair amount in 2018. So the volume
growth is plus 6%. So I suppose what's the underlying growth year-on-year excluding the
tailored and structured transactions?

Company N ame: M uenchener Rueckversicherungs-Gesellschaft AG in M uenchen
Company Ticker: M UV2 GR Equity

When you look at the underlying and compare that with last year, actually percentagewise it's almost exactly the same figure. Last year, we reported, I think if I remember
correctly, 19% total growth a year ago. When you exclude last year's big tailor-made
transactions, then the remaining and the (00:20:17) growth would have been 6%. So that
is exactly the same like this year. And this year, actually, we can't specify it's (00:20:26) not
from single mentionable transactions or so. The only case, which is maybe worth to
mention it is some positive participation in the Marine business where the market
improved. And otherwise, it comes from the regions and a number of many nitty-gritty
transactions at the end of the day. So nothing spectacular. And you're right that was to
confirm that no tailor-made (00:20:50) structured transactions or unstructured
transactions in the portfolio this year.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Okay. As I didn't get my first question answered, perhaps I could just ask a replacement
one. Just on, I mean, the €3.8 billion of net profit for 2020, I think you've had an indicative
combined ratio aim of 97% within that. But the tailored and structured transactions have a
negative margin drag, but you haven't seen that volume growth coming through at 2018,
but at the same time you have seen an increase in interest rates. How confident are you
in 97% being the right number driving that €3.8 billion, or is it a slightly higher number
now?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Yeah. Again on the outlook, but I'll try to give some flavor around it. Generally, I can
confirm, very confident of the €2.8 billion (00:21:53) target. Looking back at the 2018
figures, you see that we are exactly at the midpoint of the target range and we think this
gives a lot of support also for the next two years to finally achieve our target and
therefore we are very confident.
The €2.8 billion (00:22:10), you're right. We said in that context that the combined ratio
would be 97% based on the portfolio we had back then. And I think the 97% is still a fair
figure, but I would say that the emphasis is more on the €2.8 billion (00:22:27) compared
to the 97%. That's what I would say today. Other than that, I mean, further translating the
outlook into what it would mean operationally is something we would be happy to talk
about in March, as I said.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

That's great. Thank you very much.

Operator
Thank you. We now move on to our next question, which comes from Jonny Urwin from
UBS. Please go ahead.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Hi, there (00:22:53). Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just two from me. So
I'm just trying to think about why the growth in the large and tailored transactions has

moderated. So, I mean, what's changed internally versus this time last year? Is it just that
the opportunity didn't arise? And I know they're quite lumpy and volatile. Or is it you're
less happy with the profitability of those? And then I guess in that context, are you still
happy with the growth that you've put on in the last couple of years?
Secondly, the normalized combined ratio is running a bit higher than guidance and you're
noting that underlying is sort of more in line. I'm just thinking about – think about the
outlook again, but I'm not going to ask you on the outlook because I know you don't want
to answer, but just thinking about the starting point for that normalized combined ratio for
2018, is it still 99% or has it crept a bit higher? Thank you.

A - Torsten Jeworrek

{BIO 5724439 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you very much. Let me start with large transactions (00:23:52). The simple
question, why we didn't see large transactions or in the January renewal is, first of all, they
were not available and that is normal, I would say. That is the normal expectation. Large
(00:24:11) transaction take a lot of time to develop and to tailor them and they come
when they are ready. It was more a coincident last year that we were able to basically
write-in (00:24:23) to sign them in line with the January renewal date. It would not be
unusual to see large transactions between renewal dates or so, because they are not in
the regular renewal pattern.
And I mentioned earlier a bit that maybe the only exception, there may be a very few
larger transactions available in the United States and here we have a slightly, let's say,
reduced risk appetite to go into portfolios, particularly when you cover back books or so
where you saw already adverse (00:25:00) development on the client side. And for that
reason, in these very few months, we didn't participate and other ones were not
available.
The other question is, are we happy or were we happy, are we happy with large
transactions last year and last year's. Honestly, very happy. We are very happy. These
transactions which we wrote (00:25:22) last year, the significant big ones, are exactly in
line with our expectations. So it means profitable.
And are we happy with our growth in general? And remember we discussed last year the
many different initiatives, not only the large transactions, which we reported last year.
Honestly, I'm more than happy with the growth we developed. If you ask me, I would say
these large transactions and the growth of the specified business initiatives, which we
explained last year and I will give an update in March at our Analyst Conference, are very
good, very profitable. We have basically a bigger concern about, I would say, standard
reinsurance business and (00:26:13) the unchanged market environment. So not the
specific large transactions and growth is our concern, but the unchanged market and here
is our clear philosophy, we stay disciplined. Thank you.

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Yeah, the normalized combined ratio of 100% versus the 99%, that was your question.
First, I have to say the methodology we apply for normalization is really simplified. Some

Page 8 of 23



FINAL

Company N ame: M uenchener Rueckversicherungs-Gesellschaft AG in M uenchen
Company Ticker: M UV2 GR Equity
Date: 2019-02-06

would even say maybe overly simplified. So what did (00:26:48) we miss when calculating
the 100% normalized combined ratio? We have some unusual activity of weather-related
losses, which we had a lot (00:26:57) in Q2 and Q3, which have not been taken out by the
normalization if you look at the 100%. And we also have some, we call them, basic cat loss
activity, also included in the 100% and they also have not been taken out by the
normalization. Why is that? Because we apply the threshold for large claims very, let's say,
statically. So without any giving leeway for anything, which might be cat-related, but it's
then, in itself, smaller than the €10 billion (00:27:28). Also, you could argue that those
claims still are related to those large cat events, which we intend to take out by the
normalization. Therefore, the methodology does not really capture what's really going on,
let's say, in the core portfolio, in, let's say, an underlying view. And having said that, I can
emphasize only again that we still think and that's why I mentioned in my introductory
remark that the portfolio overall is in line with our expectation of 99% as basic profitability
in our book.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Thanks so much.

Operator
Thank you. Michael Huttner from JPMorgan has our next question. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

I've got, I was going to say, two questions. Thank you very much and well done on raising
that dividend. That's really lovely. And so, the first question is on the – you said your
reserving strength has unchanged and the reason I ask is you've released not only – was it
5.8% or 5.6% of normal basic kind of 5.8% reserve releases, but you also had 8.1% coming
from the large claims portfolio. So the way I look at it there's a total 13.9% of total reserve
releases, which seems huge number. And so there, I wonder in that context whether you
can explain why you, despite that, you still think the reserving strength has unchanged?
Mathematically 13%, 14% on €20 billion, that's €2.8 billion, seems (00:29:10) a lot.
And the second is on Solvency (00:29:16), so you've got a 250% number. Can you remind
us what the moving parts are if we were to normalize? Because you are quite
conservative. You don't have the volatility adjusted (00:29:27). You also have a very low
level of debt and you don't include any excess reserves (00:29:35). And I just wondered
how to think about it versus your peers, which obviously do include all these items?
(00:29:43). Thank you.

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Well, thank you, Michael. Yeah, (00:29:50), yeah, I take from your question that you look at
what happened in Q4 as being something rather exceptional and I don't think it is. Our
usual (00:30:01) reserves a little bit of conservatism, which over years then develops. And
in case we are sure enough that it's time to release it, then it's released again. So that's
the usual cycle as you know. And then, the cycle applies both to basic losses as well as
large losses. And as you know in Q4, the seasonal topic more or less in Q4, we are

Page 9 of 23



Company N ame: M uenchener Rueckversicherungs-Gesellschaft AG in M uenchen
Company Ticker: M UV2 GR Equity
Date: 2019-02-06

FINAL

looking into the reserves, having all the internal reserve assessments, the discussion with
the board about reserve strength and so on.
Having said that, it's also mathematically very easily possible to have an unchanged
reserve strength because basically, it means if you take out something, you also have to
take it in. And then, the missing piece in the equation is that we of course look into all our
portfolios and compare the actual development with the assumptions from prior years.
And that's something which then completely – makes the link complete between what we
had prior year, this year's reserve strength at the same time, what we were able to
release.
Also, as you know, last year and also this year, we had relatively nat cat activity, last year
much more than this year. And this of course, given what I just said that we put into the
new reserves always some conservatism means that last year, we were conservative, this
year we are again and if you want (00:31:35) somehow again this year, but at the same
time benefited already somewhat from what we did last year.

Bloomberg Transcript

So I hope this clarifies the overall picture somewhat. But again, I would like to underline
that that's not at all exceptional, that's a longstanding position, I must say (00:31:55) to
look into the reserves according to the process and that's exactly what we did again now
in Q4.
The Solvency II ratio 250%. Well, difficult to say. (00:32:12) saying, I should normalize now
for what our peers are doing. Actually, I would love to know what our peers are doing in
detail. I don't – of course (00:32:22) something where we know and our estimate is that
our ratio would be roughly 50% higher if you would include some traditional.
With respect to excess reserve, I would happy to understand what our peers are doing
and how to include them in the ratios. As far as I know, that's not something which is easily
to be negotiated with the auditors and also the regulators. But then, I am very happy to
learn from you, other than that (00:32:51).

On the volatility adjusted?

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

That's something we do not calculate regularly, because deposits would be quite what

FINAL

calculation twice. Therefore, I can only give you a rough sensitivity which is then also close
to what you know anyway from interest rates and its sensitivities.
Including a static volatility adjustment, I think it would bring us maybe 5, maybe little bit
more points in the Solvency II ratio. If you know (00:33:27) which really lift up the ratios for
some of our peers is the dynamic volatility adjustment and this is much more difficult to
estimate because this would mean that (00:33:37) valuation models, you need to
implement the volatility adjustment depending on the interest rate path you're in the
specific scenario you're looking at and that's something we (00:33:51) never

Thank you. We now move on to a question from Vinit Malhotra from Mediobanca. Please
go ahead.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. Thank you for the opportunity. So just – so, I'll stick to two questions
and maybe ask about outlook on one aspect only, but let's see. So, in the fourth quarter,
in the normalized of 101%, I understood from speaking to the IR team that there was
these aggregate covers effect, as you mentioned as well, Christoph, the basic losses
which were cat losses really. And of course, aggregate covers have been in demand
recently from the primary side to manage volatility. So, should we be a bit more
concerned about the possible effect of these random frequency aggregate type losses
coming in and polluting the normalized combined ratio in future as well? So, I just wanted
to get your sense of how much you're thinking about it.
And second question is for Torsten. Thanks for talking about this uncertainty of the ILS
marketplace. But I was just wondering, your more positive outlook for April and July
obviously is driven by them being nat cat affected. But, is there any assumption in your
mind about the behavior of the ILS marketplace? In other words, if the ILS marketplace
were to slow down a bit, then would you be more positive than you are now or would you
be neutral about it compared to where you are now in your mind? Thank you very much.
And I'll give the outlook question out. It was more about the outlook for nat cat reserve
releases, but I appreciate if you'd say to me that it's (00:36:21) rather than now. Thank
you.

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Thank you, Vinit. I'll start with the aggregate covers. We're talking about a small portfolio,
very small portfolio and we are and continue to be cautious with that (00:36:37) reducing
than increasing what we have here.

FINAL

A - Torsten Jeworrek

{BIO 5724439 <GO>}

I continue with the ILS question if that was okay. What will it mean for the remaining year
was the question. My quick answer is, I don't know. So it's a bit speculation now but what
we can imagine and where we see some early indication is the following, the ILS market
played and still plays a big and all important role, first of all, region-wise in the United
States, mainly on the East Coast and then in the retro market. The retro market was the
most, in my opinion, is the most visible signal, if you want that here is some capacity of
the ILS market (00:37:33) or changed. This didn't have an impact on the available capacity
for the tradition – of the traditional players. Not yet. But it remains to be seen whether
those players who depend more on retro will have to reconsider their capacity in the cat
business during the new year or next year. That's the first question.

Bloomberg Transcript

Second point is, from their perspective, the price loss in the wildfire event in Q4, there
were some indications that ILS markets withdrew or changed capacity away from the
aggregate covers which basically produced these losses more towards the traditional cat
excess. So, that was one observation.
Third point is, when you look at the two remaining renewal dates for April, I would say,
whatever the ILS markets will do will hardly have any positive or negative impact.
(00:38:49) renewal is Japan and in Japan, they have never been played (00:38:53) in the
past and I don't expect them to go or to be accepted in the Japanese markets in this year
or in the coming years.
For the other renewal date, July 1, we have to open our eyes and pay attention because
here the U.S. cat business is up for renewal and this is going to be more interesting
whether or to what extent the alternative markets will only shift their capacity or whether
they will also withdraw (00:39:24) capacity in total. So that is a bit open. But at least there
is uncertainty in a lot of capacities bound (00:39:32) so keep your eyes open, I would say.

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

FINAL

Hi. Morning, everyone. Two questions for me. First one is coming back to reserve
releases, I guess your guidance is naturally (00:39:54) to be 4%. They've been above 4%
for the last seven years. I checked that number this morning. So my question is, why
wouldn't you increase this number? I guess, is this the right time for a step up because I
guess we have this continued debate about your normalized combined ratio (00:40:12)
clearly has a dampening effect?
And the second question is just on, I guess, the geographical mix shift at the January
renewals. It looks like you've taken a little bit more in North America, but prices were flat.
Could you maybe kind of run through how North America increases netted off against
European declines? Thank you.

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I'll start with your question on the 4% up front loading into the reserves. I talked about the
simplified approach we are taking before and part of this simplified approach is also that
we use the 4% which is a headline figure easy to recognize for everybody. You will
recognize that this figure clearly has to depend on portfolio mix of things which changed
over the last 10 years, over the last seven years, which are changing from year-to-year.
But as we're all used so much to the purpose and I think we stick in the past to the 4%
and I think everybody is used so much to that assumption that there is no need really for
changing it, although I agree, in the past with various years, where finally, the (00:41:26)
turned out to be higher than the 4%.

A - Torsten Jeworrek

{BIO 5724439 <GO>}

Yeah. Regarding renewal (00:41:36) portfolio mix your (00:41:39) expectation is right.
Indication is for Europe, we saw small rate reductions in the – flat or small rates reduction, I
would say in the casualty business to sort of flat or slightly improved rate in the property
(00:42:05) business and in casualty and in property on the excess side, minor, that means
minor means zero to minus-5% rate reductions.
So, Europe was among the worst markets, I would say, meaning, highest price pressure
and not many positive opportunities. In the United States, it's a bit the opposite, I would
say. Here, we had flat or positive developments on the proportional side, although
benefiting from slight commission reductions and from rate reductions in the primary
business and we had then, again a mixture of absolutely flat or only slightly improved
renewals in the last three programs in property and up to 10% or in the order of 10% price
increases on the loss-affected business.
Our only negative or major negative point in U.S. casualty is the non-proportional casualty
business in the United States, because the reason is not a deterioration in the price per
se, but the prices does not increase sufficiently to compensate for the underlying sharp
inflation increase in some of the casualty lines of business. And that is the reason why we
decided to take capacity out and you saw that in one of the reports that we had a bit of a
negative view in the current market environment on non-proportional casualty United

would say.

Thank you. Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous has our next question. Please go ahead.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi, there. Firstly on ERGO, in the commentary, Christoph, I think you're encouraging us to
think of a higher ongoing run rate contribution from ERGO. I mean, sadly today we don't
have a lot of detail to test that assumption. So, when I look at it, it looks like the P&C
Germany is in line with your guidance. International is very strong possibly unsustainably so
and Life and Health has benefited from positive non-recurring effects throughout the year.
So, what really is the underlying run rate of ERGO in 2018? And what is the basis of you
encouraging us to think that it is beating on an underlying basis? Thanks. That's first
question.
Second question, a lot of your (00:44:57) around the world have been increasing their
normalized cap budgets, particularly in the U.S. I mean, (00:45:04) on your normalized
combined ratio? Do you think maybe it's the case that your cap budget, particularly nat cat
budget needs to be revisited as you're seeing a number of peers do and as I said most
of your clients doing? Thanks.

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Andrew, let me start with the first one and I'll leave the second one then to Torsten.
(00:45:30) felt you're right, I was pointing at a very good year 2018 also operationally. I
didn't really point into the future if this already means that in the future we would expect
higher contributions other than what we (00:45:48) what would be the plan of our
strategy program anyway. Again, that would be a question on the outlook which we are
happy to answer in March.
Looking at 2018 results, what makes me confident? Well, the difficult thing here is that we
are talking about various one-off effects and they are not all in Life, Health Germany but
they are relatively massively there, but also we've also others. And if we would do a quick
calculation just writing the largest of them only onto a list and then some effect because
they are offsetting each other and end up with some of what the overall one-off effect
would be ERGO, I'll end up with a figure of, let's say roughly €40 million or so positive.
Which brings me to the conclusion that if I look at the full year result ERGO for 2018 and I
deduct the €40 million, I would still be above the original guidance which was €250 million
to €300 million and I would be – there would be still a gap between where we end up and
then what the initial guidance was and the initial guidance was derived from our strategy
program.

FINAL

So, in essence, this means we do not really have to go into all the different one-off effects
which we have picked, because it's rather clear if we take out all of them, we are still
above the guidance. Why are we having still many one-offs? Maybe that's the last remark
I'd like to make. As you know, ERGO is still in heavy restructuring mode and basically have
two reasons for one-offs. One reason is that it's still are changing the way we run our
business. So for example, we are selling companies internationally. We are restructuring
the German Life business bringing books from one company to the others.
Many of the things we are doing have implications on the balance sheet and the P&L.
That's where let's say one group of one-off effects is coming from. The other group is
things which you would also find if you look at our competitors. Those are things related
to guidance we get from tax authorities to one-offs given because regulators are
changing the way they look at certain things, so regulatory-driven topics to put it in a very
general way.
And the first class (00:48:14) quite some effect into our result, but also the second one
and both together (00:48:23) €40 million and not more than that. I think the message is
quite clear.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Just to be clear, Christoph, you're not normalizing the international underwriting
profitability which I think you described does in the beginning historically – historically low
combined ratio, you're not normalizing for that in the €40 million.

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Well, I don't have to. The €40 million is just one-offs. I don't normalize for the international
result. But even if you say we have been exceptionally lucky in that, then there's still the
gap between our results and the initial guidance is so large that you could still argue
(00:49:00) operational outside of luck, ERGO was doing well in 2018.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks.

A - Torsten Jeworrek

{BIO 5724439 <GO>}

Okay. I continue with your question for the cat (00:49:13) budget. We looked into that.
And to summarize it, I'm going to go into details. We don't see a reason to revisit it or to
increase it. Absolutely not. Why not? First of all, when – it's not, I think, feasible anyway to
look at one year or two years and then to make, let's say, clear or a good calculation on
the expected value of all cat budget, over all the return periods and over all parts of the
world. That's the first part, but we looked into that. And if you ask me in what direction
would our cap budget develop over time and according to our model, the real experience
is well captured in our 8%. That is a portion of the cat budget part of the 12%. So, mostly
likely, no change.

Page 15 of 23

FINAL

If we had to change it, then probably more downward than upward. The only, let's say,
small question mark is, on the cat budget side, the modeling of the wildfires, so not the
modeling of hurricanes or so. That's the modeling of wildfires. And here, we saw some in
the past that was Canada, that was United States, we had some further of these which
were not mentioned in the past in Chile and South Africa and other parts of the world. So
that is underway, but we'll of course compare it with hurricane or earthquake or Japan
also not have this huge impact on the cat budget side.
And the other explanation is pretty simple. In absolute terms, over the last years, we
increased our cat exposures in various parts of the world, also in the United States. So,
you could argue, doesn't it have an impact on the cat budget, in general. In absolute
terms, yes. But we grew the cat budget less compared with the significant growth from
other businesses. So that means, in relative terms, the 12% refers to the total non-life
premium. In relative terms, we will not end up with a higher figure, if at all, then more in
the lower direction than in the upper direction. So, no reason to change that. 00:51:41**

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

I guess – sorry, just to follow up, isn't there a risk that you're picking up more mid-sized,
particularly with some of these old lines (00:51:50) share where you're not necessarily
picking up large cat exposure, but more mid-sized sort of cat private (00:51:58)
exposure?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Torsten Jeworrek

{BIO 5724439 <GO>}

Yes. And why not, I would say. We would be happy to pick them up if we find the right
price in that business. So, cat budget or the contribution or the composition of cat budget
is, of course, mainly driven by European winter months (00:52:19), very big scenarios. That
is normal. But this does not mean that we don't price the mid-sized scenarios and the
lower scenarios in the right way. So, it's a matter of price, not a matter of cat budgets in
my opinion.

Thank you. We now move on to Sami Taipalus from Goldman Sachs for our next question.
Please go ahead.

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. The first one is from the life and health
reinsurance business actually. You had always a very strong technical result there for 2018,
but there seems to be a couple of sort of always (00:53:01) going on there, some
favorable experience, I think mainly in the U.S., but also some headwinds in Australia.
Could you just give a bit more detail there, where you feel the run rate is and how it
compares to your target of €475 million? And then my second question is on the pricing

Page 16 of 23



Company N ame: M uenchener Rueckversicherungs-Gesellschaft AG in M uenchen

disclosure. Is it possible to just give the pricing change year-on-year, including the impact
of interest rates? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

You're right. We exceeded the €475 million quite significantly in life and health reinsurance
this year. Supported by claims development as well as also profitable new business in life
but also very much in health.
To give you some flavor, Australia, disability has been difficult, not for the first year this
time. So it's still disability in Australia, also there's upcoming legislation which potentially
makes the business more difficult for us in Australia with complex, so-called superannuitization, where it's getting more difficult for us going forward with our in force
(00:54:21).
So that's Australia, and U.S., we had a positive development on mortality. And so that's
something where I would be reluctant, to say, that's a long-term trend. It's more, if you
know the opposite that mortality improvements have been quite under pressure in the
U.S. So, therefore, this is more kind of a good claims development and – but that still
needs to be seen if our portfolio deviate substantially from what we see for the overall
population in the U.S. right now. Yeah, that's it, more or less.

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

But it sounds like on aggregate when you when you toss it all up, you're pretty much
running where you expected to be. Is that fair?

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Okay. Okay. Great.

A - Torsten Jeworrek

{BIO 5724439 <GO>}

And our pricing this rate change or pricing disclosure, you are right. I mean, we are
unchanged in a way that we do not include interest rate development. In that sense, our
disclosure is not an economic – it's not a disclosure of the economic terms in total. We,
from time to time, gave an indication what the impact on the interest rates and the
expected income from the asset side is. And you can have this figure that is close to 0.5 a
percentage point of the premium, which we renewed in the January renewal. So give this
an additional information if you wanted.
However, even the interest rate or the expected change of the investment income from
this renewed portfolio, is not an economic figure, even if you include that to our asset.
Why not? Because, first of all, it does not include the consumption of risk capital and
therefore, the impact from the pricing models. And usually, you would say, I consume risk

capital for the risk I take on board in my portfolio. And the economic feedback would be,
what is the change, so to speak, on a risk capital or called ROIC (00:56:55) basis or so.
And that is very different and they're not comparable anymore between the companies.
Second, we don't include our cost, our own costs which are part of, let's say, combined
ratio expectation which we were able to generate or to publish after the end of the year.
And therefore, we decided only to give the figure which makes basically the old portfolio
with the new portfolio somewhat comparable. And we have no plans to change that, but
we are happy to give additional information on top if you want. The figures between the
competitors and companies are not comparable anyway, because everybody uses a
different standard here. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi. Good morning. I've got two questions. The first one is on the investment side. You've
mentioned that the reinvestment yield has dipped to 2.1%, which was temporary due to
some de-risking. Perhaps you could share at what level you expect to be reinvesting in
first quarter. Is it close to the 2.5% you disclosed in the past?
And secondly perhaps a clarification question. You didn't mention that the reserve release
from major claims did include some 2017 events. Could you quantify that and perhaps
give a little bit more color on how the overall claims for Harvey, Irma, and Maria
developed? Thank you.

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Okay. I start with the claims. There we as usually would not go into that level of detail
when talking about our releases, so I'm sorry but I can't give you any more detail. On the
investment side, it's still early for Q1. So, I mean, your question is heading at that where
are we going to reinvest in Q1. And interest rate environment is still not without
challenges. And right now, we are still looking for opportunities to invest and also are
looking timing-wise, to find the right point when to go into longer investments again, also
given the still volatile environment.
Our current assumption would be that we might be able to achieve maybe 20 basis
points higher in Q1, but it's extremely early to tell where we are at the beginning of
February. So, the outcome might be completely different from what I'm saying right now.

Perhaps a little follow-up on this one. In the previous call, Jörg mentioned that you don't
expect any further headwind on the regular income and that was 2.8% yield for 2018.
Could you just confirm that statement?

FINAL

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

I think what is important to note is, is that the volume we have to reinvest quarter by
quarter is rather limited compared to the block of investments we're having. And
therefore, it will be premature in any way to judge from one quarter or two quarters
reinvestments, how the overall block would develop. In that sense and as Jörg's
statement has been only three months ago, of course, we can easily confirm that
because the reinvestments quarter by quarter anyway doesn't make that much of a
difference.

Q - Ivan Bokhmat

Thank you. Frank Kopfinger from Deutsche Bank has our next question. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Frank Kopfinger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning, everybody. I have two questions. So, my first question is on the price
development on the zero percent. And also taking into account that your major losses and
if I adjust also for this prior year developments, then your major losses had been 16.2% for
2018 which is clearly above your budget, be it on the nat cat side but also on the manmade side.
And against this background, how satisfied can you really be on your price development
at this stage and the question is how satisfied are you and whether it's really enough to
argue with a slightly higher interest rate level?
And then secondly, on your solvency ratio, you touched earlier but I would be interested in
whether you can provide some moving parts how to come from your, I think, your last
point was above 260% to the 250%, taking into account what was driven by market
movements, your bond issue obviously but also on the reserve release, whether you can
shed some light here?

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Okay. I'll start with the Solvency II question. You're referring – year-on-year, we have some
increased Solvency II ratio,. I think it was 244% a year ago, we're now at 250%. This
includes already capital management measures, as you know. And so, part of the drive of
the increase is also supporting this loan we were issuing in – I think, it was November. The
operating impact is positive all preliminary figures I must admit. It's positive and we have
then, also from an economic impact year-on-year, a rather stable development.

Company N ame: M uenchener Rueckversicherungs-Gesellschaft AG in M uenchen

Date: 2019-02-06

If you compare it, compare to last quarter, then of course we also see now our economic
solvency ratio, the reduction of capital markets which came with some reduction since Q3.
What we also have is of course that we included the capital management measures again
in our figures. So, the €251 million includes the increased dividend now and also as
Solvency II is wanting us to do it, also includes continuation of the share buyback of the
same order of magnitude like what we did last year according to what Solvency II is asking
us to do, independently of the fact that of course no decision has been taken at this
stage, and as usually, we will only talk and decide about share buybacks in March.

A - Torsten Jeworrek

{BIO 5724439 <GO>}

Kopfinger, back to your question how satisfied are you was surprising. And if I understood
the question correctly, you compared a bit, let's say, the kind of contribution of the various
factors of our last year result, taking into consideration the higher contribution from
reserve releases and the loss activity above the 12% cat losses from the new losses
against our statement. It is what is a satisfactory renewal at the end of the day.

Bloomberg Transcript

Maybe two statements. One is the renewal for our portfolio was satisfactory under the
circumstances and environment of the current market. So that means, of course, we
would all like to have better market environment, but we maneuver in this market
environment quite well, meaning that we have the right ambition to identify and develop
structure, new business, not only business in these renewals, but also non-tricky business
or tailor-made business which write in between. That is positive, because we have good
appetite and don't make mistakes, at least not to my knowledge here.
And the second is, as I mentioned, for the standard business, we stay disciplined and
don't take very aggressively priced business on board which would not be justifiable. So
that is more general statement.
Regarding, let's say, earnings composition of last year and which factor drove the result,
my answer would be the following. Don't take too many single observations or so out
from the result and draw conclusions for the new result. If you normalize, or let's say,
question certain positive contributions like the releases from last year's cat losses to HIM
losses for instance, then also take into account that, as Christoph mentioned, we always
build new conservatism into the new loss reserves, build on the basic loss side, build on
the cat and large loss side. And that is something which we, of course, can't and do not
want to quantify. And therefore, you don't see that. That is one thing.
And the other thing is, the unusual fluctuations from large and cat losses like last year also
and the year before, of course, don't mean anything about the long-term profitability of
that business. That can only be derived from the really expert models and they are no
prominent reconsideration, verification or so. So, all in all, I would say the price and the
profitability of the portfolio is good. The market environment is challenging and for that
reason, again, we can and I am very optimistic that we are on the right path to deliver and
contribute a decent and good performance for the coming years. Thank you.

Thank you. Michael Haid from Commerzbank has our next question. Please go ahead.

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Good morning. Just two questions. First question also on pricing,
one of your competitors mentioned that they feel that global warming is not sufficiently
reflected in the current pricing and in the current risk models. And when I look at your
normalized combined ratio of 100% and if I take out the primary insurance out of
reinsurance, then the normalized combined ratio is probably significantly higher than
100%. Why don't you push for higher price increases in nat cat related business? I mean,
you are one of the market leaders, you can do that.
Second question on equity investments. You reduced your equity exposure in the fourth
quarter, what is the rationale behind this? Is it more tactical? Is it strategic? Is it more
lasting or do you plan to come back?

Michael, let me start with the first one. Is global warming reflected in the pricing? Yes or
no? It depends I would say. It depends what you expect from global warming and which
kind of regional implication or changes you anticipate or will anticipate in the future. So the
answer is not so clear, in my opinion. We have, let's say, one consideration which is the
time horizon. And the time horizon of course will mean for many regions that we will see
changes in the risk and the exposures driven by climate change. And of course, here the
models have to be permanently be updated over time to take account and to reflect this
kind of changes.
What is, in my opinion, not possible and not wise would be to make, let's say, rough
speculations and price changes in the models for expected global warming, which we
think will come in 20 years from now. Global warming is a gradual effect. It's big and bad
for the society because if you don't act against it, you can't change it anymore. But on the
insurance and reinsurance side, we have to, let's say, make the gradual and very regional
changes to take into account the local impact of that. So in that regard, my answer is
mixed, I would say.
One of the global warming impacts where we believe we see changes are the wildfires.
And here, as I mentioned before, we do update our models but it would not be right, I
think, to change the model for wildfire losses in the United States or North America then
in European windstorm or somewhere else so that is not possible.
Why don't we push for higher prices? Because we are on a global competition and
reinsurance is a syndicated business, as we all know. And we play a role, but we try to
achieve what is possible to be achieved and market price at the end are result of demand
and supply like in any other industry, and that is what reflected in the prices today.

FINAL

Michael, equity investments, you're right, we reduced our equity investments somewhat
about 1 percentage point, 1.5 percentage points. I wouldn't say that's a strategic move
given the fact that we are still around – including our hedges still around 5% and came
from somewhere around 6%. So, that has not been a strategic move. It's all about risk
management or risk mitigation and the reduction of volatility in Q4. So, I would not rule out
also that this quarter would also slightly go up again, but that's all still up for discussion.

Q - Michael Hermann Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

What triggered this reduction in equity investments then? You say it's risk management,
but what exactly?

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

I mean, as you know, we have a fair mix of how we can cope with falling markets. We have
a quite substantial derivative portfolio, which automatically kicks in once equity markets go
down. On top of that, we, of course, also discuss when markets go down if you are still
happy with our exposure or if you need to somewhat reduce the exposure. And that's
what's happened in the course of Q4.

Q - Michael Hermann Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much. Perfect.

Thank you. We now move on to questions from Vikram Gandhi from Societe Generale.
Please go ahead.

Q - Vikram Gandhi

{BIO 18019785 <GO>}

Hello. Hi. Hi there. I got just one question. Can you give us a sense on where your excess
or the redundant losses (01:12:44) those figure would be for P&C re at the end of last
year? I think the last time we disclosed this figure was at the Solvency II briefing back in
November 2015 which was about €2 billion post tax. So any update there will be useful.
Thank you.

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

That's a figure we do not regularly really – neither analyze nor disclose. So the basic
assumption only can be stable because we said our overall reserving level is stable. But
that was rather an exceptional exercise what we treated in the introduction of Solvency II.
So, no news I would say with respect to that question.

Q - Vikram Gandhi

{BIO 18019785 <GO>}

Okay. So if I can just come back, when you say it's stable, we should be thinking in
percentage terms, right? Not in absolute terms because the volume has been growing
since then?

FINAL

Well, I mean that could be a long debate because volume is growing, the mix is changing
over the year. Overall stable means in a more, let's say – more actual sense that the level
of prudence is unchanged that that's how we would state that. So that's probably
somewhere in between absolute terms and relative terms. I am sorry to only be able to
put it that way. But it's really the level of prudence we have in our reserves is stable. That's
I think the correctest way to actually make that statement.

Q - Vikram Gandhi

{BIO 18019785 <GO>}

Okay. Okay. Thank you.

Thank you. We take our next question from Thomas Fossard from HSBC. Please go ahead.
Had an interruption (01:14:39) the participant has just removed himself from the queue.
And at the moment, we have no further questions queuing.

A - Torsten Jeworrek

{BIO 5724439 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. Then I may step in and just say thank you for joining us. Further
questions, please don't hesitate to come back to us and we are looking forward to meet
you all again on March 20 for our next analyst call. Thank you very much. Bye-bye.
