Presentation
Shinji Tsuji

{BIO 16148256 <GO>}

This is Shinji Tsuji of NKSJ Holdings. Thank you very much for participating in the Fiscal Year
2011 First Half Year Results Conference Call, despite your busy schedule.
Let me begin, please turn to page four.
Here are the key points. During the first half, the property and casualty insurance and life
insurance recorded increase in ordinary income due to typhoons and other natural
disasters and the impact of impairment losses on securities the term ended with a net
loss.
In the domestic P&C insurance, the effect of voluntary order premium rate hikes began to
be realized, resulting in a positive revenue growth.
Declining profitability of voluntary automobile insurance seen to hit the bottom.
Loss ratio excluding natural disasters declined and the number of claims reported leading
indicator also continue to decline from the previous year.
On the other hand, there have been a large number of natural disasters totaling ¥49.4
billion between the two companies. Paid losses resulting from the Great East Japan

Earthquake were almost offset by the reversal of the outstanding loss reserves.

FINAL

So we booked gain on reversal of the catastrophic loss reserve.
Domestic life insurance maintained steady sales growth. ANP increased significantly and
policies in force increased steadily in October, through a merger NKSJ Himawari Life was
established. In December, life insurance promotion department will be established within
P&C companies to engage in joint promotions of life insurance.
Overseas premium income group particularly in emerging countries Sompo Japan Sigorta
that we acquired in Turkey, has begun to contribute to the consolidated results.
Full year forecast has been revised downward, in addition to the impact of impairment
loss on securities a major factor for the last and the first half. Payment related to the
flooding in Thailand are the major factors.
Please go to the page five. I will first give you the overview using pages five through 10,
followed by details by business domains.

Bloomberg Transcript

Page five, shows the highlights of the first half results. Net premiums written increased by
2.1%, life insurance premiums grew by 12.5%, resulting a top-line growth, ordinary income
therefore grew by 5.4%.
But due to typhoon number 15 and other natural disaster an impairment of loss on
securities on NKSJ Holdings consolidated basis ordinary loss of ¥57.2 billion and net loss of
¥53.3 billion were recorded.
Please turn to page six.
Here you can see the breakdown of the net loss totaling ¥57.2 billion. In domestic P&C
insurance, underwriting profit recorded minus 21.9 billion due to typhoons and other
natural disasters.
Investment profit increased by 20 billion on non-consolidated basis, thanks to stable
interest and dividend income and capital gains.
Expenses other than underwriting totaled ¥7.9 billion. In domestic life insurance, top-line
grew but on accounting basis, it had a negative impact of 2.9 billion.
Overseas insurance business need a ¥3.2 billion contribution reflecting steady progress of
business in different countries.
The impact of consolidation adjustments totaled 47.7 billion including adjustments related
to purchase method accounting following stock market declines.

Please turn to page seven.

FINAL

There you can see the forecast for full year fiscal 2011. Sompo Japan consolidated and
Nipponkoa consolidated are expected to generate profit but on NKSJ consolidated basis
due to significant consolidation adjustments including purchase method related
adjustments, ordinary income is expected to be only 3 billion and net loss of 12 billion is
expected.
Compared to the initial forecast, ordinary income is revised downward by 39 billion and
net income by 28 billion respectively.
Dividends per share remained unchanged from the initial forecast and we expect to
maintain ¥80 per share.
Please turn to page eight.
Ordinary income forecast is revised downward by 39 billion from ¥42 billion to ¥3 billion,
factors are shown here.
Broadly they are two factors, one is impairment loss on securities totaling minus ¥32.8
billion. Second is projected losses related to flooding in Thailand, estimated at 15.5 billion.

Bloomberg Transcript

The net loss incurred from Thai flooding is estimated at around 30 billion. And we assume
that about half of that will be paid during the fiscal year.
Losses paid during this year, can be offset by the reversal on catastrophic loss reserve. So
the amount whose payment will not be completed during this fiscal year, will be assumed
to be recorded for this fiscal year.
Page nine.
You can see adjusted profit, which is part of the managerial indicators.
In domestic P&C insurance, there is no minor factor of purchase method adjustment. But
since the reversal of catastrophic loss reserved related to the earthquake is not counted,
so losses seen inevitable for this fiscal year, which will be covered by the 30 billion coming
from the domestic life insurance.
In total, adjusted profit is estimated at 6.6 billion.
Page 10, is a tabular representation of the same information.
So I will skip this page.

Page 3 of 20



Company N ame: Sompo H oldings I nc

So that's overall picture. Let we go into the specific business domains.
Please turn to page 11.

FINAL

First, domestic P&C insurance business shown here are the highlights of the two major
P&C insurers non-consolidated first half results.
Top-line grew but due to typhoon and other natural disasters, underwriting profit was
negative for both companies.
Accordingly, ordinary income and net income were either in the negative or recorded a
decline. But those companies have catastrophic loss reserve accumulated to cover natural
disasters.
So on the full year basis, gain on the reversal of this will be recorded, so part of the
amount shall be offset.
Please go to page 12.

Bloomberg Transcript

Net premiums written by insurance line is shown here, both P&C insurers turned into
positive growth in all insurance lines, specifically fire, personal accident, voluntary auto
insurance increased.
Increase in fire were due to strong sales of retail products at Sompo Japan and due to
effect of long-term and large policies at Nipponkoa.
In voluntary auto insurance positive effect of rate hike is gradually being materialized.
Page 13.
This shows number of cars insured and unit premium of our main state, the voluntary auto
insurance, not on the net premium written business basis, but sales premium basis that
we capture.
At Sompo Japan new car sales volume declined push down the number of cars insured.
However due to positive effect of rate hike, the unit premium increased.
At Nipponkoa, positive effect of rate hike has being realized and non-fleet unit premiums
increased by 1.9%.
Please move to page 14.
This is net loss ratio on written/paid basis.

Due to Great East Japan Earthquake mainly for fire insurance, paid claims increased.
Excluding the impact from the earthquake, typhoons number 12, number 15 and other
natural disasters have pushed up the paid claims.

FINAL

The voluntary auto insurance was affected by typhoons to some extent and loss ratio
remained at the higher level in the first half.
Moving on to page 15.
Net loss ratio on earned/incurred basis is shown. In fire insurance against typhoon number
12, 15 and other natural disasters, we provided more outstanding claim reserves and that
has pushed up the net loss ratio.
In voluntary auto insurance due to typhoons, loss ratio was almost the same as the
previous year.
And claims incurred from Great East Japan Earthquake were paid by reversing the
outstanding loss reserve. So there was very little impact.

Bloomberg Transcript

Page 16.
In voluntary auto insurance, this is new, this is the earned/incurred base loss ratio that is
changed overtime excluding large scale natural disasters. And loss ratio based on this
basis has turned into downward trend in the first half. But we cannot be optimistic going
forward.
However, we are beginning to see some signs of change.
Please take a look at page 17.
This shows what is considered to be a leading indicator for claims repaid in voluntary auto
insurance, the total number of claims reported at two major insurers as compared to the
previous year on the single month's basis.
In the fiscal year 2010, significant increase was seen from a year before. But in fiscal year
2011, year-on-year increase turned into a negative number, showing signs of it ticking out.
Please take a look at page 18.
In order to improve profitability in voluntary auto insurance continuous revision of rate is
important.
And we will continue to try to realize optimum premium rate. At Sompo Japan system of
different premium rates being applied to different age groups, was introduced in the
Page 5 of 20



Company N ame: Sompo H oldings I nc
Company Ticker: 8630 JP Equity
Date: 2011-11-18

April.

FINAL

And in two consecutive years, the rate hike was carried out at Nipponkoa following
December last year, the rate hike is expected in January 2012.
And in September, especially for non-fleet rating system notification of revision on
advisory pure premium rate was submitted and in a revised driving -- driver rating system,
we believe, some effect to mitigate decline in premiums can be expected.
On page 19.
You can see impact from Great East Japan Earthquake in household earthquake insurance
claims payment to customers was conducted smoothly.
Since the same amount of underwriting reserve for earthquake insurance was reversed as
the losses incurred there was no impact on profit and loss.
And other than household earthquake insurance, claims paid were mostly offset by
reversal of outstanding loss reserves and ¥17.5 billion in catastrophic loss reserve was
reversed as claims payment proceeded and recognized as profit.

Bloomberg Transcript

Consequently, the impact on underwriting results by the earthquake was net positive of
¥16.2 billion.
Moving on to page 20.
The impacts from domestic natural disasters is shown here. Due to the impact of natural
disasters that broke out during the first half such a typhoon number 12 and 15.
Net losses incurred was ¥49.4 billion in total for the two major insurers.
The original forecast at the beginning of the term for the two insurers was ¥27.5 billion for
the first half. So we have run over this amount.
Sum of two companies, of the total 33.6 billion was attributed to typhoons and others
included hail damage in Hokkaido.
Please take a look at page 21.
Net expense ratio, with reduction in company expenses, net expense ratio declined.

There you can see, the progress in synergies and costs of integration of domestic P&C
insurance business.

FINAL

Generally, various initiatives related to business integration are progressing as planned.
We are expecting synergies of ¥14.1 billion by the end of the fiscal year.
One-time costs are estimated at 0.4 billion for this fiscal year, most are related to system
integration efforts and will mainly be recorded between fiscal years 2012 and 2014.
Page 23.
Investment profits. Interest and dividend income in two company total was about the
same as in the previous year.
Realized gains on securities increased significantly at those companies with the progress
in the sale of strategic holding stocks.
At Sompo Japan, imperilment losses on securities increased and therefore total
investment profit decreased year-on-year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Page 24.
Investment asset portfolio. Many due to the sale of the strategic holding stocks and
declining market values balance and unrealized gain of domestic stocks decreased.
Page 25.
Regarding strategic-holding stocks based on the goal to reduce them by ¥300 billion
over a three year period ending fiscal 2012, we are planning a ¥130 billion reduction for
fiscal 2011 between the two P&C insurers.
During the first half, we reduced by 38.7 billion between the two companies, on the basis
of actual sale. Following big drop in the stock market in August, the actual amount based
on market price was smaller than planned, but we hedged 11.2 billion through futures.
So actual exposure reduction amounted to approximately ¥50 billion.
To achieve the yearly target, we will steadily implement sales in the second half.
Exposures to GIIPS countries in Europe are limited as you can see.
Page 26.

Sensitivities to interest yield, foreign currency and stock price. As for interest yield, both
P&C insurers are managing portfolios with emphasis on ALM.

FINAL

So the impact on the net asset value was limited.
As for the foreign currency exchange, we are using derivatives hedging to control price
fluctuation risks. Although it's not shown here, foreign currency liabilities related to
contract may benefit from the stronger yen, as for the impact of the changes in the stock
market, we will steadily decrease it through well planned reduction of strategic-holding
stocks.
Page 27.
Our focus on domestic life insurance from here. In October, Sompo Japan, Himawari Life
and Nipponkoa Life were merged into NKSJ Himawari Life.
On this page, you can see the history of the past mergers and company name changes,
as well as major managerial indicators.
Page 28.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let me briefly explain the business strategy of the new merged company.
NKSJ Himawari Life will simultaneously pursue enlarging sales and improving profit. So as
to become a company with the number one profitability among the P&C insurers life
subsidiaries. We will also aim at making the top ten list in the entire industry in terms of
major indicators including the number and amount of new business.
As a first step toward realizing the new management plan, life insurance promotion
department will be established in December in the two P&C insuring subsidiaries for joint
effort.
Page 29.
The positioning of the merged company in the industry, in the personal insurance field by
managerial indicators on the upper half, you can see the new business indicators, in terms
of the number of new business with the market share of 3.3%, it is ranked 11th in terms of
ANP with the market share of 2.5%, it is ranked 14th.
As Himawari Life concentrates on protection type product, it appears lower in terms of
annualized premiums, which favor savings type product.
But in terms of the amount of new business, it has a market share of 5.3%, ranking
number 7th, thus following largest players.

Page 8 of 20



Company N ame: Sompo H oldings I nc
Company Ticker: 8630 JP Equity
Date: 2011-11-18

In terms of the number of new business in medical insurance despite the fact that it is not
advertised it is ranked number three following Aflac and .

FINAL

In-force business as shown on the lower half is the accumulation of new business and
since Himawari is a late comer the position is currently lower than in terms of new
business. But we believe we can make a steady progress.
Page 30.
Outline of the results of the domestic life insurance.
Solid sales in income compensation and medical insurance resulted in top-line growth with
increase in integration of expenses and policy reserves reflecting increase in policy
income, bottom-line decreased.
This official amount -- the official announcement for EV is made only once a year, it's not
shown here. But increased revised EV in the first half was internally calculated as 18.6
billion.
The planned figures for the fiscal years is 30 billion. So we are making a steady progress
towards that goal.

Bloomberg Transcript

Page 31.
Top-line grew steadily, annualized premium of new business tend to be higher in the
second half than in the first half.
Due to channel characteristics and sales promotion. So compared to second half of fiscal
2010, a slight decline was recorded but compared to the same period of the previous
year, a slight increase was observed.
Annualized premiums on policy in force showed only a slight increase due to a decline in
increasing term life insurance. But there was a steady growth in the third sector.
Page 32.
Asset investments of two major life insurance companies centering on yen-denominated
bonds, ALM is pursued duration gap between assets and liabilities is minimal and interest
fluctuation has limited impact on net assets.
Page 33.
In the new merger to company, increase in adjusted EV of ¥55 billion in fiscal year 2015 is
the management target. And for the next five years, the cumulative increase will exceed
Page 9 of 20



Company N ame: Sompo H oldings I nc
Company Ticker: 8630 JP Equity
Date: 2011-11-18

200 billion and at the end of the fiscal year 2015, the EV will slightly reach ¥660 billion.
Page 34.

FINAL

The status of overseas insurance business is shown. Net premiums written and net
income both increased.
In Asia, Latin America and other emerging countries especially, the premiums were
growing and SJ Sigortra, acquired in Turkey started to contribute to consolidated results.
Moving on to page 35.
Overseas insurance is positioned as a growth driver for the group.
For the three years, till 2012, ¥200 billion worth of M&As are planned. And in fiscal year
2010 investments in Singapore and Turkey and in this fiscal year additional investments in
Malaysia was carried out.
In the markets where high growth and profitability are expected, we will pursue increasing
profitability and execute investments.

Bloomberg Transcript

Page 36.
This shows the status of net assets. As you can see at the bottom of this page, adjusted
consolidated net assets decreased from the end of the previous term due to the drop in
stock prices and net losses in the first half.
And based on this calculation, net assets per share is ¥4,100 plus but the current stock
price is less than 0.4 times of this level
Page 37 please.
The status of risks and capital is shown.
When calculated with the confidence level of 99.95%, which is equivalent to AA rating, the
group wide capital as of the end of September was ¥2.67 trillion surpassing the total risk
amount to ¥1.98 trillion by 690 billion.
Increase in natural disasters and decline in stock prices were among negative factors, but
we still maintain sound capital level, that is equivalent to AA rating.
Currently, internal study efforts are under way and capital management under a new
framework in reference to European Solvency II.

We hope to disclose numbers in the philosophy under the new standard by the end of
this fiscal year.
Please take a look at page 38.

FINAL

From now, I'd like to focus on the forecast for the full year results by business segment.
First on two major P&C insurers.
As I said due to impairment losses on securities and floods in Thailand, we made
downward revision to profit to industries to the forecast from the beginning of the term.
BUT thanks to no more incurred losses from the earthquake and the reversals of
catastrophic loss reserve, net income is expected to grow.
However, adjusted profit at the bottom of this table, is in red because it doesn't reflect
the reversal of catastrophic loss reserve.
Page 39, please.

Bloomberg Transcript

There are assumptions for the forecast, which was revised with the most recent
developments in mind. Because of the impacts from typhoons losses to be incurred from
domestic natural disasters were revised to ¥35 billion for Sompo Japan and 27.5 billion for
Nipponkoa.
For floods in Thailand, we expected those ¥15.5 billion in losses for the group wide basis.
The reversal of that catastrophic loss reserve with expected progress in claims paid for
Great East Japan Earthquake is expected to be to 25.6 billion for Sompo Japan and 29.8
billion for Nipponkoa.
Market indicators have been revised to the most recent levels. And capital gains and
losses on securities based on the imperilment losses posted in the first half are expected
to be 8.8 billion for Sompo Japan and 11.3 billion for Nipponkoa.
And losses from financial guarantee insurance remained unchanged from the original
forecast.
Page 40 please.
This shows the full year forecast for net premiums written. Based on the strong progress
in recent months with regards to the top-line, we have upgraded the number four
Nipponkoa. Moving on to page 41.
Net claims paid and loss ratio on the written/paid basis is shown.
Page 11 of 20



Company N ame: Sompo H oldings I nc
Company Ticker: 8630 JP Equity
Date: 2011-11-18

Based on the impacts from natural disasters, we have incorporated deterioration in loss
ratio especially in fire insurance.
Page 42.

FINAL

Net claims incurred and loss ratio on earned/incurred basis is shown.
Based on impacts from natural disasters such as typhoon especially in fire insurance, we
have incorporated deteriorating loss ratio.
Loss ratio for voluntary auto insurance, was likely start declining for the full year for two
companies.
Page 43.
In life insurance as merger expenses, 8.2 billion in systems, 3.1 billion in headquarters
relocation, and total 11.3 billion is expected resulting in net losses of ¥7.9 billion for the full
year.
So we will expect to post deficits on an accounting basis, increase in adjusted EV on group
adjusted profit basis, has remained unchanged from the original plan at ¥30 billion.

Bloomberg Transcript

Page 44 please.
This is full year forecast for overseas insurance business. Because of the yen's
appreciation among others, growth rate in premium income was slowdown compared to
the first half but stay on a upward trend.
On page 45, let me talk about returns to shareholders.
Due to impacts from natural disasters, we expect to sustain losses for the full year.
However, based on the basic policy to give priority to paying stable dividend, we have
maintained expected dividend at the end of the fiscal year at ¥80 per share.
Going forward, by steadily implementing new management plan put together the other
day, we will try our best to ensure stable returns to our shareholders.
That concludes my presentation. Thank you.

Questions And Answers
Q - Masao Muraki

{BIO 3318668 <GO>}

Muraki of Deutsche Securities. My first question is related to the flooding in Thailand.

Page 12 of 20



Company N ame: Sompo H oldings I nc
Company Ticker: 8630 JP Equity
Date: 2011-11-18

The coverage by reinsurance, that you're currently assuming and forecasting, is there a
risk that it could sleep going forward?

FINAL

And also should the reinsurance premiums rates in Asia, increase dramatically in the
future, and maybe, if that would make it more difficult by reinsurance, how are you going
to address that issue?

A - Shinji Tsuji

{BIO 16148256 <GO>}

Thank you. This is Tsuji speaking. Regarding the coverage by reinsurance, the estimated
amount itself. Actually we do have the policies that we underwrite multiplied by certain
assumed loss ratio, to estimate the rate covered.
But as you are aware, the onsite investigation or the assessment cannot be made yet. So
the assumptions that we are using are desktop assumptions if I may call them so.
We are just using all the information that is available to make the assumptions to make
the forecast.
We do have relationship with reinsurance companies to think of the amount of
underwriting amount and what is the rate of losses that we assume all these elements,
would have direct impact on the business.

Bloomberg Transcript

So there are sort of sensitive matters, so I'm afraid, I cannot disclose those with you. Bear
with us.
And regarding your second question, whether or not the flooding in Thailand would
impact the premium rates of reinsurance going forward and that might a negatively
impact the coverage by reinsurance. That was the concern that you indicated.
Here again, the actual amount of losses have yet to be identified, we'll know better as the
investigation the assessment progress. So it will all depend on what we'll find out. But
generally speaking, given the current situation, I think we can expect the coverage by
reinsurance would become more difficult going forward compared to the past?

Q - Masao Muraki

{BIO 3318668 <GO>}

Thank you. My second question is on voluntary auto insurance. You said that there has
been improvement in the number of accidents in your presentation. For the first half
compared to the initial forecast excluding the natural disasters, what kind of improvement
did you see in terms of the incurred losses?
And also compared to the initial forecast in your revised full year forecast, what are the
revisions that you have made regarding the forecasted incurred losses compared to the
initial forecast excluding natural disasters?

A - Shinichi Hara

{BIO 17738151 <GO>}

Shinichi Hara from IR, we will give you the answer later. So maybe we can take other
questions first. Thank you.

Q - Mitsumasa Okamoto

{BIO 1513316 <GO>}

FINAL

This is Okamoto from Merrill Lynch.
I have a question on flooding in Thailand. The affect areas for reinsurance in principle, are
they covered asset part of risk access or catastrophy access?
And my second question is, on page 26, you do have the sensitivity analysis for Sompo
Japan, sensitivity to the foreign currency US dollars, compared to the end of March, I find
that the sensitivity has decreased, is it because of the changes in assets and liabilities or is
it because hedging proves to be effective, can you explain that?

A - Shinji Tsuji

{BIO 16148256 <GO>}

This is Tsuji speaking. Your first question pertaining to the reinsurance. The way we think
about that the schemes, that you've indicated actually between Sompo Japan and
Nipponkoa thinking on reinsurance and the way to account for others, were different
between the two.

Bloomberg Transcript

So actually, the reinsurance coverage is considered based on the combination of the two
approaches. So more covered by per risk, excess relatively speaking yes, that is correct.

A - Shinichi Hara

{BIO 17738151 <GO>}

This is Shinichi Hara as IR, I'd like to answer your second question. On page 26. The
sensitivity to the foreign currency in Sompo Japan, you said that compared to the past the
sensitivity seems to have declined.
Well actually this turnaround, we are showing on a non-consolidated basis. Whereas
previously, we were showing the consolidated figures.
We decided to look at the non-consolidate basis to see the impact on the assets. If you
include the overseas subsidiaries, we'll have to look at the impact on the liabilities but we
decided to exclude that and that's why, we're showing on the non-consolidated basis.
And that is why you see this figure there. So it's not necessarily the case that the risk has
been reduced dramatically.

Q - Mitsumasa Okamoto

{BIO 1513316 <GO>}

So do I understand correctly, that the sensitivity hasn't changed much?

A - Shinichi Hara

{BIO 17738151 <GO>}
Page 14 of 20



Company N ame: Sompo H oldings I nc
Company Ticker: 8630 JP Equity
Date: 2011-11-18

The foreign currency exposure has been reduced during the first half. So in that sense,
yes sensitivity and reality has been lowered.

Q - Mitsumasa Okamoto

{BIO 1513316 <GO>}

FINAL

Thank you.

Q - Natsumu Tsujino

{BIO 2234779 <GO>}

I am Tsujino from JP Morgan. The incurred losses in auto insurance excluding natural
disaster have improved, that's what you said. But in all insurance lines, incurred losses for
Nipponkoa and for Sompo Japan, how are they compared to the previous year and to the
first half of this year?
I think numbers are mostly flat, but their factors like household earthquake insurance is
another included. So if you can give us specific numbers that would be appreciated?
That's my first question.

A - Shinichi Hara

{BIO 17738151 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I am Hara from IR. In the first half of this fiscal year, the claims incurred excluding
household earthquake insurance, this has a great impact, was recorded increase of ¥1.1
billion for Sompo Japan, have you excluded natural disasters such as typhoons.
Obviously household earthquake insurance and earthquake insurance I excluded but what
about natural disasters such as typhoons. If you exclude those compared to the same
term last fiscal year, how were the things, ¥1.1 billion thus include the impacts from natural
disasters, oh, I am sorry, 1.1 billion is wrong, at Sompo Japan losses incurred from natural
disasters for the first half, this fiscal year was ¥27.7 billion and excluding natural disasters in
all insurance lines losses incurred is what you wanted to know.

Q - Natsumu Tsujino

{BIO 2234779 <GO>}

Well, compulsory auto liability insurance should be excluded, if it's too difficult then, what
are the trends excluding natural disasters if you can give us a piece of trend? That will be
appreciated.

A - Shinji Tsuji

{BIO 16148256 <GO>}

I'm sorry, to have kept you waiting. In this first half, the loss incurred was ¥296.6 billion and
in the previous year, it was ¥301.1 billion.
So that would give us a reduction of ¥4.5 billion and that is for Sompo Japan. Okay?
And as for Nipponkoa, the first half of this fiscal year, it was ¥155.2 billion and in the
previous year, ¥157.4 billion. So that would mean ¥2.2 billion reduction was recorded.

Q - Natsumu Tsujino

{BIO 2234779 <GO>}

Page 15 of 20



Company N ame: Sompo H oldings I nc
Company Ticker: 8630 JP Equity
Date: 2011-11-18

Understood. My second question is about incurred but not reported or IBNR, in auto
insurance IBNR, we have seen about ¥2 billion increase from the end of March this year.

FINAL

So for the last year, the loss ratio have been increasing, you said the reason why. If that is
the case, then including IBNR and incurred loss ratio in auto insurance, seems to be flat or
down from the year before, but is it actually declining more or has there been any
additional impact from the typhoons recently?

A - Shinji Tsuji

{BIO 16148256 <GO>}

The increase of ¥2.2 billion thus reflects worsening results of the past few years.

Q - Natsumu Tsujino

{BIO 2234779 <GO>}

Okay, understood. Then that means that there is no additional losses in the first half. If
that's the case, then excluding those incurred losses in the recent months, maybe
declining more?

A - Shinji Tsuji

Yes. That is correct.

Thank you.

Q - Takanori Miyoshi

{BIO 16985826 <GO>}

I am Miyoshi from Goldman Sachs.
My first question is on page eight of the hand out.
With regard to the revision of the full year forecast, the main factors are expanded
impairment losses on securities and floods in Thailand. But with regard to the positive
factor, 9.3 billion is it something that will occur on the recurrent basis, or is it something
like one time gain on sale?
Can you give us a breakdown of this number?

A - Shinji Tsuji

{BIO 16148256 <GO>}

Let me answer that first question. It is a small amount each, has been added up to
constitute that number. Firstly, the auto and liability insurance outstanding loss reserve is
expected to be reduced from the original forecast for Sompo Japan. And at the
Nipponkoa the overseas outstanding loss reserve is expected to be reduced because of
the yen's appreciation.
And at Nipponkoa the claims expected to be paid is reduced from Great East Japan
Earthquake. And at Sompo Japan net interest and dividend income is expected to go up

from the original forecast and that is also a positive. And all these added up to cost of
these numbers.

Q - Takanori Miyoshi

{BIO 16985826 <GO>}

FINAL

So expenses ratio reduction or loss ratio improvement none of those things that are
recurrent in nature are included, is that correct?

A - Shinji Tsuji

{BIO 16148256 <GO>}

That is correct, basically. However, the outstanding loss reserve in auto insurance in that
sense has incorporated a slight improvement trend.

Q - Takanori Miyoshi

{BIO 16985826 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much. My second question, page 37. Status of risk and capital.
Regarding that capital, I can understand, there is a slight decrease. But for risk compared
to the end of March, I find that the risk has declined by about ¥100 billion, what accounted
for this decline in risk?

A - Shinji Tsuji

{BIO 16148256 <GO>}

This is mainly due to a decline in market values of stocks held.

Q - Takanori Miyoshi

{BIO 16985826 <GO>}

I see. Thank you.

Q - Jun Shiota

{BIO 4127431 <GO>}

Shiota from Daiwa Securities Capital Markets.
My first question. I understand that overseas companies did well but there are natural
disasters taking place in some countries, is there a chance that these may show up in later
quarters?

A - Shinichi Hara

{BIO 17738151 <GO>}

This is Hara as IR. I don't think that's likely, that is because when we look at the
geographical areas where natural disasters are affecting, our exposure is limited.
But one thing, if you go to the flooding in Thailand, Sompo Japan has a subsidiary in
Singapore, which has a slight exposure, which will be reflected.

Q - Jun Shiota

{BIO 4127431 <GO>}

But, it's not reflected in the first half results. But they will show up in the next quarter or in
the second half, is that correct?

A - Shinichi Hara

{BIO 17738151 <GO>}

Right, it is not included in the first half results, but it is reflected in our full year forecast.

FINAL

Q - Jun Shiota

{BIO 4127431 <GO>}

I see. Thank you. My second question is on possible reduction in corporate tax rate, being
discussed at the National Parliament. Are you already calculating what the impact of that
happening would be on your business?

A - Kazuhisa Tamura

{BIO 3567238 <GO>}

This is Tamura of Accounting. The impact of revisions in corporate tax rate of course will
have impact.
And we will be reducing the amount of deferred tax assets.
But when it comes to how you calculate the reduction is not clear. Are we going to use the
tax rates, used after the revision or do we do the scheduling of tax recovery over a three
year period.

Bloomberg Transcript

So due to those uncertainties, it is very difficult to make the exact calculation. So we don't
have any exact amount, that I can share with you. But hypothetically, assuming that
effective tax rate of the corporate tax after the revision, we will be applied. We have
made the rough calculation and the amount is about ¥24 billion, that's our current
estimate.

Q - Jun Shiota

{BIO 4127431 <GO>}

I see. Thank you.

A - Kazuhisa Tamura

{BIO 3567238 <GO>}

This is Tamura from Accounting. And I like to give the answer to the earlier question raised
by Mr. Muraki of Deutsche Securities. Compared to the initial forecast what was the result
in the first half and what about the full year forecast?
Compared to the initial forecast, the actual result in the first half showed slight
improvement it's the way we see it. But because of the natural disasters, we expect some
additional payments in the area of auto insurance as well. So on the full year basis we
believe, that the amount would be on par with the initial forecast.

Q - Analyst
I'm Osaka from Nomura Securities. Thank you for today, there is one question, there are
two questions rather.
And firstly I have a question on page 45 on dividend. Just for clarification, despite
downward revision of the forecast annual dividend of ¥80 per share will be maintained,
Page 18 of 20



Company N ame: Sompo H oldings I nc

Date: 2011-11-18

that's what you said.

FINAL

But suppose damages from Thailand floods increased or there is further deterioration in
second half, there is no revision in dividend because it is based on net assets, so will that
be correct? That's my first question.

A - Shinji Tsuji

{BIO 16148256 <GO>}

Tsuji speaking. With regard to return to shareholders, we base this on the midterm
management plan that was announced the other day. And we're looking at payout ratio
from the midterm perspective. And we do have enough funds to finance dividend.
So to answer your question, it really depend on to what extent, there will be deviation
from the full year forecast.
If the downside deviation is limited to a certain level, then we don't have any intention to
change our policy at the moment. That's all.

Q - Analyst

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you. My second question has to do with page 25, the exposure in the European
market, the numbers as of the end of September were disclosed. But if you can, can you
just give us information such as any changes in October or November or any further
selling that may have taken place?

A - Shinji Tsuji

{BIO 16148256 <GO>}

Tsuji speaking. With regard to exposure in Europe at NKSJ Holdings as an advisory panel
to the Board, there is investment committee, consisting of three external Directors and
two internal Directors.
And one of those external Directors is a British.
And this committee gives recommendations to the Board on the investment.
And at this committee, the variables in the euro zone, are being closely watched. And it's
just in euro zone but investments in foreign bonds in various countries are being
discussed at the committee, thoroughly.
And at the moment, their stance is to continue to watch closely. And since the disclosure
as of the end of September, there has not been any major actions taken.

Q - Analyst
Thank you.

I am Miura from SMBC Nikko Securities. I have another question on dividends. You said
that you are committed to midterm dividend.

FINAL

But the harsh environment in the near-term and amount of risks are changing. And you're
making preparations for establishing a new company. And if there is any change in your
policy on dividend, what would be the possible trigger? That is my question.

A - Shinji Tsuji

{BIO 16148256 <GO>}

Tsuji speaking. The current midterm management plan is the basis for the dividend. And
for the short-term period profit and loss if this is within our current assumption then there
is no plan to change the policy.
If something completely out of the scope of our assumption happens then that maybe a
different story. But for the moment, we don't have any intention to change our policy for
the time being.
