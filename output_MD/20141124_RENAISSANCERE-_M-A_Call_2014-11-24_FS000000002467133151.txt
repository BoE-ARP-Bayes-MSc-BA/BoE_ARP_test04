Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Peter. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Early this morning,
we announced the acquisition of Platinum Underwriters Limited, a fellow Bermudadomiciled reinsurance company. We're excited about this deal and believe it enhances
RenRe's competitive advantages and market position in the reinsurance space. For today,
I will provide a high-level overview, then Jeff Kelly will speak to the transaction structure
and financial highlights, and I will finally go over why we believe this transaction is attractive
for our shareholders.
At a high level, we believe the transaction enhances our client and broker relationships by
increasing our product offering and accelerating the growth of our onshore U.S. footprint.
We're able to optimize the combined property cat book given our modeling expertise
and ability to allocate business across our various owned and third-party balance sheets.
Additionally, we expect a number of operational efficiencies and believe the deal will be
accretive to shareholders.
Finally, we believe that Platinum is a good fit for RenaissanceRe from a cultural and
integration perspective. We have known the company for a number of years. And some of
you will recall we were initial investors in Platinum's IPO in 2002. Additionally, we provided
consultancy services to them for a few years after that. Platinum is a well-run reinsurance
company with operations based in Bermuda and the U.S. We believe Platinum has good
risk management frameworks and practices in place and have managed their book well.
With that high-level overview, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff ?

Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Thanks, Kevin. I'll walk through some of the transaction economics in the discussion that
follows. And in doing so, I'll refer to the investor slide deck we published on our website
this morning along with our transaction press release. Specifically, my comments will start
on slide four of the investor deck.

FINAL

Total consideration for the transaction is $1.9 billion, shareholders of Platinum will receive
$76 per share which equates to a September 30 price-to-book multiple of 1.3 times and a
24% premium to Friday's closing price. The transaction will be financed using a
combination of cash and stock, and the breakdown is approximately 60% cash and 40%
stock.
On slide five of that deck, we provide some details of the transaction consideration. For
the equity component of the transaction, we anticipate issuing 7.5 million shares that will
raise approximately $760 million. The cash component of the transaction which totals $911
million will include three sources which we include some details on slide of that deck – the
slide five of the deck.
On the top left of that slide, you can see first Platinum will pay a $10 per share special
dividend equal to $253 million to its shareholders prior to or at closing. Second, we
currently plan to issue an incremental $300 million of senior notes. And finally, the
remainder of the cash component amounting to $611 million will be paid from available
funds at RenRe.

Bloomberg Transcript

On slide 17 of the deck, we include a pro forma balance sheet as of September 30, 2014.
Pro forma common equity of the combined entity will be $4.1 billion. Total investments and
cash will total $9.4 billion following the transaction. Our analysis indicates that we will
maintain substantial financial strength, and flexibility and the resulting debt leverage ratios
remain at very reasonable levels.
The combined entity will have $2 billion of gross premiums written. Of that amount, 56%
of total premiums relate to the property cat, property reinsurance and marine lines, 31% is
specialty and casualty and 13% relates to our Lloyd's business.
We believe the transaction leverages the operating platforms we have built and provides
an opportunity or some expense reductions. Our initial assumption for ongoing annual run
rate expense saves is $30 million. We also anticipate we will incur implementation cost of
$30 million in connection with the transaction. Our internal analysis also indicates that the
transaction will be accretive to book value per share, earnings per share and to operating
return on equity.
As part of our due diligence process, we conducted in-depth internal and external thirdparty assessments of Platinum's reserves and reserving methodologies and believe the
overall level to be adequate. As we've often said in the past, one of the important metrics
with which we measure ourselves is growth in tangible book value per share plus
accumulated dividends over the long term. We believe this transaction is an attractive way
to deploy capital and should generate solid returns for our shareholders over time.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Kevin for his – some detailed comments.

Thanks, Jeff. On slide seven of the deck, we outlined our strategies to be the best
underwriter in simple terms and striving to match the most desirable risk with the most
efficient capital.

FINAL

This is a slide we have often shared with you. We attempt to do this by focusing on our
three competitive advantages: superior customer relationships, superior risk selection and
superior capital management. This transaction fits well within this strategic framework.
On slide eight, we provide an overview of Platinum, which I'm sure many of you are
already familiar with. We believe Platinum is a well-run company that has managed its
business in a disciplined manner over time.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to slides nine and 10; I will go over what we believe are the key benefits of this
transaction to shareholders of RenaissanceRe. First, we believe the combination of
RenaissanceRe and Platinum benefits our clients and brokers as we're able to offer an
expanded suite of products, as well as grow our client base. As we have discussed in
recent calls, we believe the reinsurance market is shifting. Companies that can deliver
broader solutions to their clients will have an advantage. This transaction positions us well
in terms of enhancing our strong client and broker relationships.
In keeping with that theme, the transaction allows us to accelerate the growth of our U.S.
onshore platform. Recall we have been growing our specialty reinsurance platforms and
capabilities since 2008, and most recently, in the U.S. with the build out of our onshore
team. We believe that our enhanced market presence in the U.S. will further our
reinsurance relationships with brokers and clients. As part of the transaction, we will take
on Platinum's U.S. operations that are located primarily in New York City as well as a
smaller regional office in Chicago.
Thirdly, the deal allows us to optimize the combined property reinsurance portfolios. We
have the expertise and technology to make the portfolio more efficient while utilizing our
own and third-party balance sheets to improve overall returns. Pro forma for the deal, we
anticipate property cat premiums will account for 50% of the total based on business
written over the past 12 months.
Fourth, we believe the transaction will bring with it a number of operating efficiencies. The
combination of the two complementary books of business will reduce required capital on
a combined basis. At the same time, we gain greater scale and the potential to take
significant costs out of the system. As Jeff mentioned, we currently anticipate about $30
million of annual cost savings on an ongoing basis.
As a result of these benefits I laid out, we anticipate the deal is accretive to shareholders
on various financial metrics such as book value per share, earnings per share and ROE.
Finally, we believe the combination with Platinum makes integration easier due to a
number of factors. Platinum's reinsurance-focused business is one that we understand
well. We were able to easily understand and model their portfolios using our own
platforms and the REM System. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we have a great
Page 4 of 16

Date: 2014-11-24

FINAL

degree of familiarity with Platinum's risk management and underwriting frameworks and
many of its key individuals.
We have some additional slides with more details on the subjects I discussed, and I would
like to conclude my remarks on some thoughts around integration of the two companies.
We value RenRe's culture highly. As we have often said in the past, we believe it has been
a key driver of our success and a key component of how we manage risk. Our culture will
undoubtedly shift with the core tenets of what has made us successful will persist and our
underwriting principles will not change.
Our top priority during the integration process is to absorb the expertise of both
underwriting teams and deliver seamless value to our clients and partners. As mentioned
in our press release, our senior management and board will remain in place following the
transaction. So in conclusion, we're excited about this transaction. We look forward to
serving our clients and brokers with a broader platform and set of relationships and a
continued solid financial position.
I know we have questions in the queue and we will do our best to answer them. But as
you can imagine, we have a pretty full day today.
With that I'll turn it over for questions.

Q&A
Operator
Your first question comes from John O'Brien with Barclays. Your line is open.

Q - John O'Brien
Hi. Good morning. My first question is, was the deal openly marketed or was
RenaissanceRe the only bidder and also was there any breakup fee agreed upon?

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Thanks, John. This is Jeff Kelly.
We were able to have a 30-day period of exclusivity in discussing the deal with Platinum
and there is a breakup fee of $60 million.

Q - John O'Brien
Okay. And then second question, I mean, maybe you could just touch on why RenRe feels
the need to pursue or buy something to diversify versus growing organically and how you
guys think about that.

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Page 5 of 16

FINAL

So, this is Kevin.
This is something that is just furthering the strategy that we have. All our organic initiatives
will remain in place, and we see Platinum as a good strategic fit to further enhance the
things that we're already doing. So, I wouldn't see this as a shift or as a change in the
things that we've done in the past. We remain committed to being the leader in the
property cat market, and we see that bringing Platinum on adds greater diversification
and greater capital efficiency. The organic initiatives that we've been successful with since
2008 continue exactly as they were before the transaction.

Q - John O'Brien
Okay. Thank you, guys.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Brian R. Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yeah. Good morning. A couple of quick questions here; just first, if you could chat a little
bit about the excess capital position. You talk about how it's going to be substantial here
post the transaction, maybe you can kind of go a little bit more into that. Is there a
reduction in the combined company's excess cap, because I know Platinum and RenRe
both had really substantial excess capital positions? How much is it being reduced? And
then also on that given the transactions going on right now, do you have to stop share
buyback at this point?

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Thanks, Brian. It's Jeff.
I guess without quoting specific numbers about excess capital, as I've said in my
comments, while we anticipate after the close of the deals having a very significant
amount of excess capital and liquidity as a combined entity, obviously in the combination
of the two firms, there are capital efficiencies and we are deploying some of those and
utilizing cash in the transaction consideration. So, we think that is a good use of some of
the combined company's excess capital, but we think pro forma the company still remains
very strongly capitalized.

Q - Brian R. Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

And what about current share buyback program, Jeff, to kind of suspend that while the
transaction is going on?

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Well, I'll just remind that through the first three quarters – through the first – through the
earnings call, we had repurchased about $514 million. We're deploying $600 million of our
own cash in this transaction. So, it is a lot of capital management in 2014/2015. We'll just
Page 6 of 16



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2014-11-24

have to take a look at the capital position and all the other variables we look at in making
decisions without share repurchases.

Q - Brian R. Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

FINAL

Got you. And then last question, any discussions with rating agencies so far as far as
maintaining the A plus rating?

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

We have had discussions with all three of the rating agencies, and we actually contacted
them mid-week last week. And we are – they need to go through the processes that they
need to go through. But I think we have very good relationships with the rating agencies.
We've agreed to provide them whatever information they need to make their ratings
decisions. But I would say, at least from our perspective, the principal constraints around
our capital are internal tests, and we remain very heavily capitalized versus those internal
tests.

Q - Brian R. Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great. Thanks for the answers.

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Sure.

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Vinay Misquith with Evercore. Your line is open.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. You talked about $30 million worth of expense saves. I was just curious
about whether you thought that there would be leakage of business in the form of dissynergies. And how much of Platinum's property cat business do you plan to keep on your
books versus sort of diversify (18:10) away?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
So, we, doing due diligence, spent a lot of time looking at their book of business, and we
feel confident that we can retain the portions of the book that we want to retain. With
regard to the property cat business, that's going to be an evolving story as to how we
bring that on to our platforms and how we share it with our third-party capital partners.
I think in general, it'll be treated – once it's integrated, it'll be treated in exactly the same
way as our book where we are writing it on both RenaissanceRe's paper and then we're
taking companion lines on DaVinci. To the extent there's other sidecars or things
introduced for some of the Platinum business is something that we'll determine as we
look more carefully as to what the customers need.

Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2014-11-24

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Sure. So, just having more diversified premiums, would it help you to write more property
cat premiums just versus a stand-alone RenaissanceRe book?

FINAL

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Yeah. That's a great question. Not only does bringing this diversifying premium on add
capital efficiencies and operating leverage to the platforms that we have, in our economic
model, bringing on diversifying profit allows us to write more property cat. To be honest,
with our without this traction – this transaction, we were not constrained to accept more
property cat, and our appetite for property cat remains as strong as it was prior to the
transaction as it is after the transaction.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Okay. That's helpful. And RenaissanceRe runs at zero tax rate; I believe there's a small tax
at Platinum. Do you have a sense for what you plan to do in the future with the taxes?

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Well, we do have a U.S. 953(d) balance sheet upon which we pay taxes. So, we'll look to
consolidate our U.S. operations into balance sheets that make the most sense for us. But I
do think that we'll continue to try and manage that aspect of our business as cleanly as we
can.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Sure. And on the Platinum side, in terms of the management teams, do you have any
plans to keep them in place right now, and what are the retention terms that you've
discussed?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Yeah. We're not buying just a book of business. We're buying Platinum, and we see a lot
of value in their U.S. operations. At this point, we have a agreement for Liz Mitchell to stay
on who is the Chief Executive Officer of the U.S. operations for Platinum, and we're thrilled
to have her joining our team. Over the period of integration, we'll get to know the rest of
her team in more detail, and we hope that many of them will become part of the
RenaissanceRe franchise going forward.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar with Macquarie. Your line is open.

Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td

Thanks, and good morning. Maybe a quick follow-up question, is Michael Price staying or is
he going? Did I miss that on the last question?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell

FINAL

Michael Price will not be joining the combined entity going forward.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 16979665 <GO>}

Got it. That's helpful. The other question I had was on the cost savings and the one-time
costs. Can you expand on what is included in those numbers?

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Sure. I would say in the – so in starting with the one-time costs there, there are a lot of
things in there. There are lease termination expenses, probably some software write-offs,
things like that that are always a part of any combination like that. But I would say the
dominant item there are compensation-related in terms of either change of control
payments or severance over – anticipated over the period of time through which
companies are integrated.

Bloomberg Transcript

And in terms of expense saves, similarly, we anticipate some expense saves from
facilities and just reduced infrastructure, and there will be some cost saves that relate to
duplicative positions around the company. And in particular, those tend to be most heavily
focused in areas in effectively running a public company.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 16979665 <GO>}

Got it. And I guess the only other question I had was – and you mentioned the reserves in
the opening remarks. How does their methodology in terms of loss reserving – how did
that compare to your RenRe methodology?

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Well, we think it compares quite closely. They have some different lines of business. They
have more – they have a lot of long term data that informs their reserving methodologies
that in some cases is longer than ours. But overall, we did a lot of diligence in this area,
hiring our own third-party advisor on reserves and we came out very comfortable that the
reserves are adequate as stated.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 16979665 <GO>}

Got it. That's all I have. Thanks for the answers and good luck for the future.

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

Your next question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.

FINAL

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Good morning. Thank you. Just first question is that when you look at this transaction and
have you looked at other opportunities, because given the change in the reinsurance
marketplace, have you looked opportunity, for example, getting closer to the end user
like acquiring a primary specialty insurance company?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell

Bloomberg Transcript

Actually, I think there has been a lot of discussion about getting closer to the customer.
And I think that conversation is one that I would actually change slightly to be a
conversation about disintermediation, where people are seeing capital come in at
different parts of the chain, and they're seeing risk being matched with capital differently
both in property cat and in other lines of business than what has historically been done.
It's our belief that as long as we're adding value between risk and capital, there's a role
for us in any market. And as this market changes, we are constantly focused on providing
value in that. And so, as far as thinking about the move to primary, our view of that is really
one of, it's playing a valuable role in the changing capital structures that are supporting
different types of risk and making sure you have a role to play in that. We've been a
leader in third-party capital for many years and we believe that this acquisition provides us
with additional flexibility as to how to manage not only our own capital, but third-party
capital as well.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. I remember on the last earnings call, you talked about your expertise in the
specialty marketplace because you – in that market, you're growing pretty quickly. What
sort of expertise you think the Platinum transaction will bring to the combined platform?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
As Jeff had mentioned, Platinum has managed this book of business from – as Platinum
since their IPO, but much of the data and much of the business actually was transferred
over to them. So they have very longstanding relationships. I think they have very strong
claims frameworks. They have very strong audit frameworks, and they have a keen
understanding of the type of risk that they're taking.
So, I think bringing their expertise and bringing what's best about Platinum to
RenaissanceRe more broadly, is certainly a goal of ours during integration and certainly
bringing RenRe's culture and what is best about RenRe to Platinum's book is a goal of
ours during integration.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. Lastly, does this change your guidance for 2015?

Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Byrnes with Janney Capital. Your line is
open.

Q - Ryan Byrnes

{BIO 16902592 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning, everybody. Platinum has seemed to do a business shift over the past
couple of years, and this year particularly. It seems like they – from an underwriting side,
the returns aren't as great, so they're shifting to more alternative and kind of hedge fund
investments. Is that something that we should expect to continue as you guys take on that
portfolio?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
No. I think we like the underwriting that Platinum has performed. We think they've done a
good job managing their book of business. And bringing that business on to our platform
because of the diversifying nature already enhances returns for the book on our platform
compared to theirs. So, our investment strategy will largely be consistent. We may see
some shift in our duration just as we are looking at this being a longer tail book. But I
wouldn't expect to see a – the shift to alternative investments that Platinum was
contemplating.

Q - Ryan Byrnes

{BIO 16902592 <GO>}

Okay, great. And then my second one or sort of my last question is third-party capital
opportunities. Should we view – would you guys look at doing it outside of, I guess, the
core prop-cat space now? I'm just trying to think obviously because Platinum gives you
these other capabilities of more casualty and specialty lines. Is there a possibility there
down the road for third-party capital opportunities?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Again, I think our expertise in third-party capital management has largely been focused
around property cat, but we have a – strong relationships with lots of different capital
providers. Different capital providers have expressed interest in different types of risks,
and we are certainly open to managing Platinum's risk and our risk on both our platforms
Page 11 of 16



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2014-11-24

and on third-party platforms, similarly as we have done in property cat. For the time being,
I would expect that most of the risk for Platinum on the casualty and specialty side that will
reside on owned balance sheets.

Q - Ryan Byrnes

{BIO 16902592 <GO>}

Okay, great. Thanks for the color, guys.

Your next question comes from the line of Ian Gutterman with Balyasny. Your line is open.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Hi. Thank you. I guess my first question is the $611 million of Renaissance cash being used,
is it reasonable to say that's essentially your excess capital being deployed, or it's not the
right way to think of it? Is that maybe using some of the Platinum's excess capital too, or is
that not even the right way to think about it and it's just cash?

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Thanks, Ian. Well, it is just cash, but I think you could say that it uses – as a stand-alone
company, that $600 million is a portion of what we think about as our excess capital.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Got it. Okay. And again, that's the excess from your balance sheet, and is it fair to think of
the $10 dividend as using some of the excess capital that was existing on the Platinum
balance sheet?

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

That is – I would say that is some of the excess capital on their balance sheet, but not all.
And I think in addition, as we try to convey – the combination itself, we believe, creates
excess capital by virtue of the diversification benefit that Kevin talked about and some
anticipated third-party capital management of portions of the cat book. So I think, taken
together, we think the deal is extremely capital efficient for us.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Thanks. That part makes sense. I was just trying to think through I guess back to Brian's
question. So as a starting point, you can do $600 million less of repurchase than you could
have done otherwise, but that's somewhat mitigated by the fact that there's excess
capital created by the deal. Is that a fair conclusion?

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

It is a fair conclusion.

Okay, great. And then on the accretion, I'm just curious how – I mean, it makes sense
obviously with a lot of cash in the deal, it's going to be accretive. Can you give us a sense
if you had done all stock, would this still be accretive to EPS and ROE?

FINAL

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

I think – over time, we believe that the capital efficiencies that created – that this deal
creates would have allowed for that. But we think the way the deal is structured is
appropriate for both firms and utilizes the capital strength of both firms that would have
been, I think, it wouldn't have made sense to capitalize in an all-equity basis.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

No. Sure. I'm just thinking when – right, I was just thinking more of an opportunity cost
situation as opposed to the reality. And then, I think my last one was I know it's early, but
any sense of PGAAP adjustments? I guess, one, how much goodwill might be created and
then two, I mean, I can probably back into that, but just I know sometimes when
companies haven't done reserves, you have to sort take this day one which are maybe
take away from the future earnings power but accrete to book. So any rough sense of
what that might be?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

I think the excess purchase price is $228 million. As we get closer to the close, we'll make
an assessment of how much of that gets allocated to goodwill and how much to
intangibles, but I wouldn't – it's probably not worthwhile speculating on that at this point.
We have a view, but at the end of the day, that will be something that gets decided as we
near close.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Okay. And then on the reserve side, because obviously a lot of their earnings have come
through reserve releases, I was wondering is there a potential that a lot of that has to get
capitalized and sort of lowers the pro forma earnings power for stand-alone PTP?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Actually, can you repeat that? Sorry.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Well, just wondering when you do the PGAAP adjustments on their reserves, might you
have to sort of capitalize some of their reserve redundancy, so that on a go-forward
basis, they'll have less reserve releases in the combined entity than they would have
stand-alone?

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

I wouldn't want to make a judgment on that at this point, Ian.

Got it, okay. Thank you very much. Appreciate the call.

FINAL

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Sure. And just to clarify my comment, the $228 million is an estimate of the excess
purchase price that actually gets decided at close, but it's our best guess based on 9/30
numbers.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Scott Frost (35:08) with Bank of America Lynch.
Your line is open.
Hi, thanks for taking my call. I just wanted to go over the ratings again here. I understand
your comments the agencies have to go through their exercises to evaluate. But if I said
that you believe that your pro-forma financials indicate this transaction would be ratingsneutral and that you're managing quantitative metrics to achieve that goal, would that be
accurate?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
One thing I would say is, before Jeff comments, we manage not for the rating agencies.
We manage to build what we think are the most optimal portfolios. In general, we look at
our internal constraints as being the guiding constraints as to how we manage the
business. And based on all the numbers that we're looking at, we feel that we're in a very
strong capital position after this transaction. But it wouldn't be accurate to say that we –
our internal guidelines are to manage to a rating outcome.

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Yeah. I -

Q - Operator
Okay. Go ahead. Sorry.

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

I would just add to that, Scott (36:20). I – so, we think we have good relationships with the
rating agencies. We are in discussions with them all the time. And I wouldn't want to
speculate on how they will come down on this other than to say that we think, on a proforma basis, the combined company has a high degree of capital strength and flexibility,
and it's consistent with how we've managed our business in the past. So, but I wouldn't
want to speculate on their actions. That's their business.

Your final question comes from the line of Vinay Misquith with Evercore. Your line is open.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Hi. Sorry. Just a follow up on the capital question once again: so, when you're thinking
about $864 million of cash off the balance sheets of both the companies which is pretty
substantial. So, curious as to whether, I mean, on a normalized basis, once the deal is
done, can you sort of buy back stock with 100% of earnings or will you need to hold back
for a while until your capital position gets even stronger?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Well, Vinay, as we've tried to say in our discussions around share repurchases, I wouldn't –
we try not to forecast the dollar amount that we would look to buy in any specific period
because that isn't how we think about it. But I don't think at least from – at this point in
time, and it is only a point in time because a lot can happen between now and close, but
at this point in time, I don't think we would feel the need to build capital further to
repurchase shares. So, I wouldn't think of us as being particularly constrained in that
regard.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Sure. Right. So, from now until close, you can still buy back stock? Is that right or are you
legally stopped from buying back stock?

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Well, I think we've deployed a lot of excess capital here in the last 12 months, and I think
we'll take stock of this. We'll work hard to get the transaction closed, and we'll make
judgments between now and close on how we work out there.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Okay. Sure. Thank you very much.

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Okay. Thank you, everybody. Again, we're excited about the news today, and we thank
you for your questions, and obviously our team is available to answer any other questions
that you may have. Thank you.
