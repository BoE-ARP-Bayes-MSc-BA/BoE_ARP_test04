Thank you, Andrew, hello and good morning to all of you. Thank you for joining the call
today. As you saw from our release yesterday evening, AXA performed well in the ﬁrst
three months of 2021. Our total revenues increased by 2% in a quarter still marked by
COVID-19 related restrictions supported by growth in our preferred segments. Also our
Solvency II ratio was very strong at 208% and we also pursued our action on climate and
societal topics since the beginning of the year, notably by issuing our ﬁrst Green bond
pledging to invest EUR2 billion in French SMEs impacted by the COVID-19 crisis and
acting as a Chair of the new Net-Zero Insurance Alliance. Let me now quickly go through
the key numbers from the release, starting with P&C. P&C revenues were up 2% overall
with the continued strong growth of 4% in commercial lines and stable revenues in
personal lines. In commercial lines, we continue to beneﬁt from favorable pricing
conditions across all our major markets at AXA XL and in France, and Europe.
And the outlook remains positive. More speciﬁcally, at AXA XL, price increases on
renewals were up 15% in insurance and up 11% in reinsurance translating into a price eﬀect
of plus 11% on gross written premium. This favorable price eﬀect was partly oﬀset by
continued and disciplined exposure reductions across the portfolio which resulted into a
minus 7% impact on revenues. Overall, a 4% revenue growth at our AXA XL with a strong
focus on proﬁtability. As you know, the quarter was quite active in terms of nat cats
especially in the US.

Bloomberg Transcript

For AXA XL, we estimate a slightly higher than usual nat cat charge for the ﬁrst quarter,
including from severe freeze events in Texas. We also however estimate the more
favorable than expected non-cat loss experience. As a consequence, we believe that AXA
XL is on track towards its EUR1.2 billion underlying earnings target for 2021. In personal
lines, revenues were stable.
We saw some price softening on the motor side, notably in China, due to change in
regulation. We expect the price softening trend to also impact Europe linked to COVID-19.
On the other hand, we saw favorable pricing and volume eﬀects in non-motor for France
and Europe. Moving to other lines of business, in health, we saw continued growth with
revenues up 5% in the ﬁrst quarter. This was driven by both group up 6% and individual
up 4% with growth in most of our geographies, in particular in international and Europe.
On the life side, we recorded EUR2 billion in net inﬂows and continue to see a favorable
business mix with inﬂows in protection and unit-linked and outﬂows in G&A savings. In
terms of revenues in life and savings for the quarter, two things I would like to highlight.
Firstly, the strong performance in individual savings in France up 8% with higher sales of
unit-linked retirement products and Eurocroissance capital-light products. Secondly, a
good momentum in Japan from both a successful campaign of a capital-light products
and continued growth in protection.
Finally in asset management, AXA IM delivered a revenue growth of 17%, a strong
performance with plus EUR13 billion of net inﬂows in the quarter and an improved
business mix towards alternatives. I want to highlight also that 90% of AXA IM eligible
assets under management are now classiﬁed under sustainable ﬁnance disclosure
regulation Articles 8 and 9, the most demanding EU regulatory disclosures for sustainable
funds.

FINAL

Moving on to Solvency II. Our Solvency II ratio was at 208% at the end of March, an
increase of 8 points since the end of last year. To give you a bit more details and insights
in the key moving pieces, the increase stems from a positive operating return net of
accrued dividends of plus two points, favorable market eﬀects mostly from higher interest
rates of plus seven points and an additional point coming from the ADC put in place at
AXA XL.
This was partly oﬀset of course by the reduction in the UFR with an impact of minus two
points. We expect structural positives on Solvency II in the near term with the recent
issuance of our green CO2 bond as well as the disposal of AXA Bank Belgium expected
to be completed in Q2. So in conclusion, ﬁve things to retain. First, AXA performed well in
a quarter still characterized by COVID-19 restrictions. Our preferred segments are
performing well and we remain disciplined growing where we have the best returns.
Second, we continue to see a good pricing dynamic at AXA XL and we maintained our
underwriting discipline. We are on track towards our $1.2 billion underlying earnings
targets for 2021. Third, France and Europe also performed well. Notably, with strong sales
in individual savings in France and good momentum in health in Europe.

Bloomberg Transcript

Fourth, in terms of our Group revenues, we are pleased to see some good momentum in
Asia coming from Japan. As you have seen, AXA IM also have a very good quarter. And
ﬁfth, our balance sheet remain very strong with a Solvency II ratio at 208%. An overall
strong start of the year. We are now focused on execution and delivering on our planned
targets. I'm now happy to take your questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions). The ﬁrst question from Andrew Sinclair from Bank of America.
Please go ahead.

Q - Andrew Sinclair

{BIO 17749036 <GO>}

Thanks. And morning, everyone. Three for me as usual, if that's okay. Firstly, just on XL,
just really wondered if you could give us some more color on the drivers of
outperformance in the non-cat areas of XL in Q1 and any expectation from recurrence of
those positives in coming quarters. Secondly was just on, if you could give us an update
on the EUR1.5 billion in COVID loss ﬁgure. Has that evolved in Q1 in terms of FERC losses
and frequency beneﬁts. And thirdly was -- I was actually just looking at the French Life APE
ﬁgures, pretty huge jump in French health APE up about 30% and at the same time
French protection APE was down about a quarter year-on-year and just wondered, if you
could give us some color on those big news. Thanks.

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

So thank you, Andrew. First of all, what we said is that we -- as you highlighted, regarding
XL, our nat cats experience was a little bit above our expectations, but the non-nat cat

FINAL

experience was a little bit better, thus having a sort of compensation eﬀects. So the nonnat cat exposure is mainly driven by a good experience in large losses to a larger extent
and to a lower extent some positive evolution expected in attritional given the very high
prices implemented in the ﬁrst quarter.
Your second question refers to the impact of the COVID. EUR1.5 billion was the amount of
the cost estimated at the full year of 2020. We still think that it's the best view we have on
our COVID losses so far and of course, there are still some uncertainties left as we say that
the full year 2020 on the situation in France, and we'll see how things evolve, but so far, I
would say 1.5 is our best estimate.
Third, you had some questions on the APE in France. And the increase in the health APE
in France was primarily driven by the increased sales in the international business from
our partnerships in the US. You know that we have a very strong franchise in employee
beneﬁts in France and we are capitalizing on the structure to expand on some
international opportunity from time to time and the US, we have a strong franchise with
partnerships there with the insurance -- other insurance providers fronting the business
for us.

Q - Andrew Sinclair

{BIO 17749036 <GO>}

And on the other side, on protection APE was down quite a lot year-on-year.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

On the protection results related to very large contract. So on the EB side, which are, you
know, from time to time going up or down. So no trend here to highlight. Just it's -- it's a
business where you have ups and downs, but it's really driven by group contracts, EB
contracts.

Q - Andrew Sinclair

{BIO 17749036 <GO>}

Understood. Much appreciated. Thank you very much.

Operator
Thank you. Next question from Jon Hocking from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone. Just got two questions please. Firstly, are you now ﬁnished with
the reduction in exposure at XL, should we start seeing the volume sort of track more in
line with rate going forward? That's the ﬁrst question. And then second, in terms of the
individual life performance in France. Can you talk a little bit about how the agents have
adapted to COVID and what we should see as restrictions still continue to lift through the
summer, are the agents going to get back to working? It seems that they have been pretty
productive in the current situation. Thank you.

So ﬁrst of all, we have not changed our policy at AXA XL since you know what we said in
the Investor Day. The year '21 will be dedicated to margin improvement. And so we are
sticking to our plan. And there will be no change as to the end of the year. We are really
about discipline and I would take the sort of exposure reduction as a good news and not
as a bad news, right. We have renewal rates with our customers, which are very high, but
will reduce the exposure of their clients and we don't hesitate to not to renew the
business or even not to write new business when we think that the pricing is not the right
one and we are not isolated of course on the markets to do this, but at AXA XL, we have a
plan, we stick to it. You know our target. We want to achieve it. And so it's all about
consistency.
Your second question was related to the performance in France. I think, and it's true that
we are comparing here of Q1 '21 with a Q1 2020 where in January and February, there was
no COVID impact. So this quarter, it's particularly the -- diﬃcult in terms of growth.
However, you highlight that in individual savings, we did well and we did well in France,
especially because we are, I would say one of the leaders in over 25% of the market for
the new retirement savings plan called (inaudible) which is a very strong business with a
stronger tax incentives and where we had the possibility to have a unit linked rate above
50%. And this explains this resilience of the individual life savings performance in France.

Q - Jon Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Thanks, Etienne.

Thank you. Next question from Peter Eliot from Kepler Cheuvreux, please ahead.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thanks very much. Etienne, just a few points of clariﬁcation, please. The ﬁrst one on the
claims experience at AXA XL. You say a higher than usual nat cat charge, I assume you
mean higher than 6% for the new cat budget, is that the right interpretation?
And the second one just on the earnings guidance, very helpful that you've reaﬃrmed
that. I just wondered, if you could sort of remind us when you think of that how you think
of the risks to meeting that guidance. I mean, I guess when you're thinking of it, you're
assuming that nat cat sort of going to exceed 6% and there is no adverse development on
the back book, but yes. And but yeah, and if you could sort of say on the conﬁdence and
the risks on that would be very helpful.
And then ﬁnally, AXA Bank Belgium, I know you're expecting it to close this quarter. Just
wondering, the sort of the great [ph] conﬁdence there because I guess obviously
originally it was supposed to close 12 months ago -- expected to close 12 months ago and
it's been a little bit delayed but just conﬁrmation that you're fairly conﬁdent on it closing
this quarter would be great, thank you very much.

FINAL

Hi, Peter. So ﬁrst of all, you're absolutely right, when we say compared to our
expectations, it's in terms of nat cat for AXA XL. It's compared to the 6%. Absolutely right.
And the reason for this is that, there was the Texas freeze where the deﬁnitive cost are not
yet completely known, but where we think it's manageable, but still, it has an impact and
to a much lower extent some ﬂoods in Australia.
So this was what -- the highlights. I would even say of the ﬁrst four months of the year. The
second question relates to the earnings guidance. I would say, what are the risks, the nat
cat out [ph] their construction risk and this is the main one. I don't see the back book as a
major risk at this stage. And we don't have news compared to what we say the
exhaustively at the full year 2020. You know that the with ADC the liability lines our legacy
book and liability line is really under control, and you remember as well, what we said on
the COVID reserves, which are very conservative. So I would not be overly anxious about
that it gets you book at this stage.
Your third question related to AXA Bank Belgium, I understand your question because
there is such an inertia in the administrative process to get banking transactions done in
Europe that it's diﬃcult to understand from the outside, but this is the reality. What I can
tell you is that we don't have any more questions from the banking regulators either in
Belgium or European one. And it's purely a question and then is to achieve waiting period
and the likelihood and this is my feeling that we get the authorization is not far away from
99%. I would say on us how away from 100%, at 99%. Now the likelihood that we closed
before end of June is very, very high, but not 100%.

Thank you. Next question from Michael Huttner from Berenberg. Please go ahead.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 21454754 <GO>}

Good morning, and thank you. And I've a few questions on Solvency II, you provided
some granularity. So I just wanted to check were the numbers right? Essentially I'm trying
to ﬁnd out or the question is what is the contribution of the operating return? I have it by
diﬀerence is being 4%, which would imply 16 for the year, which is a great number? But
just wondered if you could conﬁrm and maybe give some color here? And the second,
you said just now COVID was mainly reserves. And I just wondered if you could update us
how much would be EUR1.5 billion ﬁgure is still heard? And how much is paid relative to
year end? And then maybe two more, if I may. But you kind of imply that merger was a
diﬃcult business at the moment with volumes and pricing down. Just on the, if you could
give some color? And also AXA and if you could give a split of the assets with the high
value stuﬀ the alternative? Thank you.

So on the Solvency II, we communicate on the operating result net of dividend that plus
2%. I will not conﬁrm the 4% precisely, details we don't want to give. As you know, we
don't make the full closing at the quarter and therefore, we don't intend to give you a very
precise number on this. You know that we communicated on 20% operating return on a
yearly basis, everything being normal, and you can take the assumption you want for the
dividend, but we take always the dividend paid for the previous year. So here, EUR1.43
which we approve. So you can make the math, and I hope that you can leave with this very
small and certainty around the operating return which is above four or ﬁve depending
upon the way you calculate it.
The second is that the EUR1.5 billion was the number we gave in June. We aﬃrmed that
half year and full year last year. At this stage, we don't have any reason to communicate
on a diﬀerent number. So we stick to it.

Bloomberg Transcript

Third question, the motor environment, you saw we are ﬂat for the reasons we just
explained that the volumes are slightly so the volume from country to country are
diﬀerent, but we have still a positive net inﬂow at group level in terms of number of
contract. The pricing is slightly down and the counterparties that the frequency is still
relatively favorable even if at the higher level than the Q2 level, I would say, of last year.
So it's little bit early to say what will happen on the frequency side for the half year. What
we see that indeed the prices are not increasing. There is a pretty high level of
competition, but we are doing pretty well. We think that our performance is pretty
resilient, and I would like to highlight as well that on the non-motor side, we have quite a
positive evolution. So that in total, the best in the lines are doing pretty well in this ﬁrst
quarter.
Your fourth question is related to AXA and to the business in alternatives, which
represents around 20% of the average assets under management. It was up 13% in Q1,
and we reiterate our target revenue growth of 10% a year until 2023.

Q - Michael Huttner

Thank you. Next question from Dominic O'Mahony from Exane BNP Paribas. Please go

Q - Dominic O'Mahony
Hello. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple on to start, I understand that you
recently consolidated your AXA XL Reinsurance businesses together in Bermuda. Can you
just highlight the rationale for this and any potential ﬁnancial beneﬁts that might come
from it? And then just a clariﬁcation on the top line. I understand that you reported and
the adjusted growth because of the -- that we basically the Q1 2020 and kind of likely
driven by the reduction in economic activity because of COVID which then plays through
into premiums and that was sort of rebased in 2020. Maybe if that's expected to bounce

back once we're back to normal and planes not ﬂying and so on, well actually, would you
see this is sort of the new normal?
And then just a question on Chinese motor. You highlighted the impact of regulatory
change reducing average premiums in Chinese. Could you just maybe give us a bit of
context as to whether this is positive or negative call if your volumes for your proﬁtability
you might think this is the deregulation of that market might be changing some of the
competitive dynamic? Thank you.

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

Hello Dominic, so you had a question on the XL reinsurance reorganization and it's
perfectly right, we have decided to establish a new company in Bermuda, which we carry
all reinsurance operations of AXA XL. The rationale for these changes is to reduce
complexity within the group to reinforce the line, the management responsibility and
accountability on these speciﬁc segment of business and this is the way we deal with all
our entities in the group. So we think it will enhance accountability, transparency and
eﬃciency to the beneﬁts of our clients and our business.

Bloomberg Transcript

And I remind you that AXA XL Reinsurance Limited is rated by S&P and Ainvest it's seen
as core by both agencies and it beneﬁts from the same rating as the other and these are
the group with AA- stable outlook.
The third, you absolutely clear right in your analysis of the comparable growth for XL and
the reason why we made this restatement, if you will, is that it gives this plus 5% growth is
more representative of the underlying growth we will disclose in the upcoming quarters,
everything being equal. So this is what you can take as a sort of trend for this year.
Your third question on China. Actually, there was a change in regulation at the beginning
of Q4 or end of Q3 last year. We've two things happened. The Chinese regulators said
they want to reduce the start-up pricing, and second, they wanted to increase the
insurance coverage of the policies to better protect the customers with both measures. It
has created a lot of movements in the market because actually prices have come down
and in order to maintain a combined ratio below 100% of everybody expected the
commission ratio to go down, which is not yet the case, I would say.
So the Chinese market as a whole is in the short term impacted negatively by this change
in regulation. We expect it to come back to normal in the upcoming quarters, but it's a bit
early to say. So this explains the reduced momentum on our Chinese business because at
the same time, what we did was to select the best risk and not to run for volumes in the
current context because it would have been detrimental to our combined ratio. So you
will see this is impacting the whole P&C industry in China at the moment.

Q - Dominic O'Mahony
Thank you.

Thank you. Your next question is from Farooq Hanif from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi everybody, good morning. In terms of the green bond that you've raised, can you talk
again about your rationale for raising capital given your Solvency II position and given
your cash position? I mean it seems like you don't really need it, and I'm just kind of
thinking about the philosophy behind that. So second question is on your Microsoft
agreement on health. Can you explain how that might change maybe the proﬁtability or
service dynamics or fee dynamics of existing businesses? And what it does for growth?
And the last question is on update on disposals. I mean I believe in the press, there's
been some talk about your Malaysian business and I'm just wondering whether you feel
that there is still signiﬁcant non-core disposal potential? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

So ﬁrst question. Thank you, Farooq, for your questions. The ﬁrst one related to the green
bond. First, there is nothing new. You remember that we provided you with the analysis of
our plan. Finance -- well, our capital management plan, I mean the IRB in December. As
you have seen, we can aﬀord at comparable gearing to raise EUR3 billion of debt
between 2020 and 2023. This was the ﬁrst part of the plan. We are not forced to raise
debt each year. So we will see. But given the extremely good ﬁnancing conditions at the
moment, it was very tempting to take this opportunity. I remind you that we have a spread
of just a little bit less than 150 bps, which is extremely favorable market conditions. So this
was, I would say, the reason why even if it was in the plan, the market timing was
excellent. And then each year, we'll see if we raise debt or if we don't do it.
Second, on the Microsoft transaction, it's not a transaction, it's a project, sorry. We have
been working on such initiatives for quite a while, including in Asia with a project called
Emma. Here, we are accelerating with Microsoft and the objective is not short-term to
boost the sales. I think it's really to improve the customer experience around health at
AXA. By this, we want to have a better retention of our customers. We want to attract from
time to time new customers, but it's more retention and also should have a positive
experience on the loss ratio because we will improve the prevention, we will improve the
sort of triage to our preferred providers. So it's a full ecosystem around the health, where
we think that the customer needs are very high and the expectations of the customers are
not fulﬁlled from today nowhere. So it's really about the qualitative approach on health
and I'm very positive about the long-term beneﬁts of this project. But it's not like an M&A
deal, it's not like expect that new products, which is going to change the numbers in the
upcoming quarters. It's really fundamental long term move for our group.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Just to be clear, you'll be implementing these capabilities in countries like the UK and
France as well, presumably with a more Asia focus?

No. So I look to Asia -- sorry, because I had this experience in Asia with the project called
Emma. The new venture with Microsoft is starting in Europe, and we had two pilots in Italy
and Germany, which are highly promising. It will be rolled over the other European
countries. And then in the second step to France, but France has itself its own
characteristics and is moving into the right direction, and we'll see if they take this
platform in a step two. But I would say it's at the end of the day the idea to have a global
approach on health services for AXA customers.
Your third question related to disposals, as you know, we are keen to pursue the
simpliﬁcation of the group and to our focus on the countries where we have a competitive
advantage in the long run. So we might from time to time continue our program of
disposals. The priority is to target the countries within the International segment. I cannot
comment more than this. I think this is something we explained during the IR Day in
December, there is nothing new on this. And as you know, we will also have a very strong
ﬁnancial discipline in order to reduce or eliminate the potential dilution coming from such
disposals when they come.

Thank you. Next question from Oliver Steel from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.

Q - Oliver Steel

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

Good morning. So three questions from me. The ﬁrst is on protection volumes, which
were up 1%. I'm not looking here at the new business so much. I'm looking at the sort of
the premiums. But this is actually now the second year in succession where the growth in
protections actually be a bit less than new target 3% year-on-year in the ﬁrst quarter of last
year, it's 1% this year. How much of that is economic? And how are you expecting that to
sort of pan out as lockdowns end?
And second question is on AXA IM, and the 17 -- so basically the margin that you
generated on average tons went up from 17 bps to 19 bps. Is that all just simply a function
of improved mix or I think you mentioned or I think, you mentioned their outperformance
fee. I'm just wondering, how much of that margin uplift came from the performance fee or
anything exceptional? And then the third question is about sort of French government
attitudes, it comes in two parts, one is, given that you're still saving money on frequency
and there's still lockdowns in France. Are you expecting to pay any further contribution
towards sort of COVID solidarity funds?
And then separately, if you do make further disposals this year. What is the French
regulatory attitude towards you sort of been eliminating any earnings per share valuation
through buybacks?

FINAL

Thank you, Oliver. So the third question relates to the growth in protection business, plus
1%.You might take that as a disappointment compared to the performance in commercial
lines and health. The other two preferred segments. I see that diﬀerently because as I said
in the introduction, we are comparing our performance with the Q1 last year, which was
not impacted by the COVID in January and February.
So nothing worrying. And I think that once the lockdown will reduce or the eﬀects of the
lockdown will reduce, we will see a natural move up on the protection side in terms of
new business and business. So I'm not overly worried. We might have also some more
potential coming from Asia when -- and notably from Hong Kong once the frontiers will
open again -- open up again.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, no, I would say the plus 1% is not represented above the run rate. It should be higher
and at the latest, I hope Q3, Q4. AXA IM, we have a revenue growth of 17%. I would say
that you have within that around one third, which is linked to non-recurring, I would say,
performance fees. So sort of one-oﬀ. One third to make it very simple coming from an
improvement in business mix, which is due to the (technical diﬃculty) of the alternative
business but also within the core business and a positive business mix towards multi
assets -- multi-asset and high yield lines of business. And the third component is, of
course, the increased average assets under management. Regarding the French
government, you're right to say that they are very tempted to come with you with creative
ideas in terms of taxes, every time we make proﬁt. We haven't heard anything on the
motor side. The only idea, which has been put on the table, but it's really an idea or
concept. I'm not sure as we go through is on the health side, where remember you that
last year, they said, we should have to pay the 2.6% tax on health sales on 2020 and 1.3%
on '21.
Both taxes were booked in our accounts in 2020. Now let's say the prices continuing
maybe the 1.3% was not high enough for '21. We are not sure that this will grow, this idea
will be further developed, but this is potential risk, which is diﬃcult to assess at this stage.
We didn't hear at all about new solidarity taxes to be frank, and now we are speaking
more about opening up the economy and the caﬀeine [ph] restaurants slowly but surely in
the upcoming days. So I don't think that the risk is really high.
Regarding potential, the consequences of the disposals and potential share buybacks for
us. There is not really anything new. What we just saw is a shift in the supervisor attitude,
you know from a blanket ban to a case by case approach, which we think is very positive.
And this is why we were able to conﬁrm or to announce and conﬁrm the dividend of
EUR1.43, which is back to normal situation, I would say. There are no speciﬁc statements
from the ACPR on the share buyback.
However, given the very solid solvency and the positive prospects of the vaccine, we see
no reason to be worried for that especially from Q4 of this year.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

(Technical Diﬃculty) remarks you made passing reference to the benign experience of
your reserve covered by the ADC protection for XL. Have you actually done a formal close
for NSTAR at the end of the ﬁrst quarter to support that statement? And if not, when is the
ﬁrst formal close to assess the ADC? Is it the end of June? Or the end of December?
And then secondly, please. What's most prominent in your mind at the moment in terms
of thinking about inﬂation risk? Some people are worried about US toll [ph] costs as the
courts open up, some people are worried about the return of drivers to the road. There's
always something to worry about. So, maybe there is nothing to worry about on this point.
But in terms of what you've seen in the ﬁrst quarter, what's the most prominent in your
mind when you think about inﬂation?

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

Hello, William. So the ADC contract has been closed in recently. So, I hope that it's good
news from your point of view, I don't think the market.

I'm sorry, Etienne. Sorry, Etienne. I know the contracts being closed. I just meant, when is
the ﬁrst formal reporting schedule to your counterparty?

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

So, we have actually, as you know, no formal closing as of the ﬁrst quarter. We review our
reserve twice a year. So, it will be more a topic for the half-year.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Right.

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

Regarding the inﬂation risk. You're right, there is always a question, a reason to worry in
our business. On this one, I wouldn't say that it was on top of our agenda in terms of risk,
of course, you can always say, you know the cost of claims could suﬀer from inﬂation.
But at this stage, it's a bit early and I wouldn't ﬂag any speciﬁc risk on top of the agenda
really for now. You can say, it could be a positive because maybe it will help getting back
to a normal interest rate curve. This is I think the way we see it more, it's still a little bit
early stage to draw conclusions. So, it could be an opportunity. There could be some
more inﬂation on the claims, which could be a slight negative, but nothing I would say at
this stage, nothing really signiﬁcant.

Q - Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Good morning all. Couple of questions, if I can.
Firstly, could you talk about the nat cat experience outside of XL in your main European
businesses, in the ﬁrst quarter? And secondly, if you take on board the debt and the
bombells [ph] if it completes, your solvency will be 216 [ph], which is I think 7 billion, north
of the 190%. How do you propose analysts assess your capability to return capital now
that you have taken away the boundaries of higher and lower comfort zones. What do we
-- how are we supposed to think about that?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

Hello. Andrew outside of XL, the nat cat experience was slightly below what we expected.
There were no really -- real nat cat events in 1Q. But I would say, we are only at the end of
Q1. So let's wait a little bit before drawing conclusions, but if your conclusion is a good
start of the year, I would say yes from this point of view. And on the solvency side, you are
absolutely correct that Q2 solvency will go up in a mechanical way because 2 events are
already known, which is the impact of the debt, 4 points and the expected 4 points from
AXA Bank Belgium disposal, so you're absolutely right that we will be above our longterm target of 190%. It's a bit early to say in the year, how we are going to manage, I
would say these excess level of solvency. And I would propose to have a discussion at the
half year about this. In the meanwhile, you have also the possibility, even if it's marginal,
we could reduce a little bit, the level of hedging on some equity positions in order to get
a better return on our assets but still a bit early to answer this question, mechanically,
you're right.
I would say that, I see that as a positive. I would say to be comfortably sitting with a sort of
caution about our long-term target and it's a very nice contrast with the situation we
experienced last year.

Oh yes, good morning, Etienne. Two questions, the ﬁrst one will be on the commitment of
AXA to allocate 2 billion to the French recovery participation loan scheme.

FINAL

Could you tell us a bit more how you are going to deploy what the expected return, and
the risk attached to this new scheme and how you're going to -- who is going to support
ultimately the risk around this scheme.
Second question will be related to the cash at the Holdco company. So starting from the
year 4.2 billion reported at the end of the year. Could you say there has been any
signiﬁcant positive or negative movement and maybe if you could update us on your
thinking regarding AXA, Eurolife restructuring. Thank you.

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Thomas. Tomas (inaudible). Thomas is a German version of Tomas and I have a
bias, sorry for that. So. hello, Tomas, and thank you for your question. And so the French
scheme, I would say, we think that it's a win-win deal because we are very happy to
support the French economy in terms of solidarity. On the other side, the 30% of the risk
is taken by the French, I would say, government. It reminds us a little bit of the system of
sponsored loans granted by the bank during the crisis. So it's sort of an opportunity and a
nice way to support the economy at the same stage, so we think that the risk return is
favorable to us.
Second at the Holdco level, we have and so what's happening at the moment is
absolutely bang in line with what we expected when we disclosed the struts [ph] plan in
December during the IR Day, knowing that the cash at the moment is you can imagine
above the level that we had at the end of last year, because, a big part of the dividend are
being paid in the ﬁrst part of the year.
And including in the ﬁrst quarter. And we really think that the prospects in terms of
liquidity for the end of the year, which should be at least at the upper end of our longterm target, if not above. Third, AXA Life Europe. We successfully signed a reinsurance
agreement between AXA Germany and AXA Life Europe to reduce the capital constraints
at the level of AXA Life Europe. When I say successfully signed, you can say, but it's an
internal contract, you do whatever you want. I say successfully because we got the
authorization from the -- not only from German regulator, but also from the Irish regulator,
which is for us something very important. And now, we will dedicate the upcoming
months to try to get the authorization to distribute an exceptional dividend from Ireland to
the holding company because we have an excess level of capital there.

Q - Thomas Fossard

Okay. Next question from James Shuck from Citi. Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Hello, good morning. So three questions for me please. Actually ﬁrstly, the ambition AXA
2023 on the underlying earnings per share. You have the cost reduction target in that
number, but there's also eﬃciency gains. So I'm just intrigued to know whether the start
that you've had up to this point means that the revenue growth that you've got
embedded in those targets will get you conﬁdence in delivering on the eﬃciency
elements of the underlying earnings per share?
Second question on solvency, the ADC beneﬁt, I think you mentioned in your comments
there's about one point beneﬁt from the ADC. Could you just clarify that? That seems a bit
low to me. What is it in relation to the risk capital at AXA XL, please. And then ﬁnally, I
notice from the SFCR that the franchise business hasn't paid a dividend again in 2020,
can you expect it to pay a dividend in 2021? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

Thank you, James. So on the ambition 2023, you are absolutely right that the contribution
to the new EPS [ph] or the cost is signiﬁcant, both in terms of cost reduction. And second,
in terms of eﬃciency, which supposes that the revenues go up and there is no reason for
us to change anything in what we said in December. We are conﬁdent, both in our
capacity to reduce cost and second, to continue to grow our revenues in order to have a
better expense ratio. So no change here at all, we just conﬁrm our plan.
In terms of solvency ADC plus one point at group level, of course, which means a bit more
at the AXA level. It's already diﬃcult to isolate one item without looking at the
diversiﬁcation beneﬁts and this is certainly the why you might have expected a bit more,
but it's absolutely mechanical here and the solvency situation at AXA XL remains above
our risk appetite and in line with the upper range of our risk appetite. So there is
absolutely no reason to worry on that. And our capacity to distribute the earnings
whatever level, they are in 2022 based on the 2021 earnings is conﬁrmed at this stage.
You highlight the situation of AXA whereas you know the cash upstream is managed at
group level. So we have various situation between the entities from year to year, but the
plan for 2021 is absolutely in line. I just said that before with our expectations, when we
disclose the plan. It's the EUR14 billion cash upstream absolutely conﬁrmed at this stage
and the solvency situation of AXA FASB remains much above the risk appetite limits at this
stage with 155%.

FINAL

Q - Pierre Chedeville

{BIO 15076220 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning, Etienne. Two quick question, ﬁrst question regarding tax fees in asset
management. I wanted to do if you give me information regarding eligible funds for tax
fees? And if you have any concerns regarding ESMA reform, regarding the way of
calculating that fees on the ﬁve-year basis, instead of one year? That's my ﬁrst question.
And my second question is related to participative loans. I read this morning in vehicle
and alternatives which was not very clear for me right said that the insurers are sure then
their asset managers and bank has to work with. But they don't mention AXA, while AXA
will be, as you said, a signiﬁcant participant to this positive. So I wanted to know what will
be as the bank or asset manager, you will make a B&M with? Thank you very much.

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So Pierre, hello? I fear I will not be able to answer this two questions in a very transparent
way. The ﬁrst one is very precise and technical question on the accounting metrics related
to performance fees, and I propose you to deal with the IR team, which will itself connects
with AXA IM to understands and ensure that we give you the proper answer.
And on the participating loans, it's true that we are a major market participant and that
these loans are distributed by the banks and we will take our share of this distribution. So
I'm not sure to understand exactly what it means to select one partner because it's, for
me, there is a platform. It's euro depreciation and so once again on this one, you don't, if
you take to get back to the IR team. If there is something, I mean, but for me, it's really
sort of no-brainer. There is a platform initiative, and we take our share of it and the banks
are intermediaries.

Q - Pierre Chedeville

{BIO 15076220 <GO>}

Yes. I thought exactly like you, but maybe you will see this morning in an article in Diego,
you will see a strange article on that issue is signiﬁcant to understandable. That's why I
was asking the question because in my view, I was thinking like you. I don't understand is
this question of B&M between insurers and asset managers that which is mentioned in
this article.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you, and good morning, Etienne. Just a couple of questions from me. So ﬁrst
of all, like pricing in commercial lines in France, it was pretty strong at about 4%. I mean
could you just give some color as to is it just inﬂation driven? Or is there is a bit of extra
pricing as well? That's the ﬁrst one. And second one is, I mean, I'm not sure I'm going to
get the answer, but I'll still ask you. You mentioned that you get a lot of cash ﬂows from
starting ﬁrst quarter. Now you mentioned that it has already been strong, but is it possible
for you to give any indication on number? Or say, what portion of your annual cash ﬂows
are already in as you have got from the subsidiaries to holding company for the group?
Any thoughts on that would be great? Thank you.

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

Hello, I'm not sure I got -- and sorry for that. I'm not sure I got your two questions. On the
ﬁrst one, I heard the word international.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

No. Commercial lines in France, the pricing in commercial lines in France was pretty
strong at about 4%. Is it all driven by just inﬂation? Or is it there is a bit of extra element on
pricing as well?

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

No. Sorry for that. It's not an inﬂation. As you know, it's mainly driven on the large
accounts. Certainly, part of it is sort of impact from the COVID crisis as well. So there is a
hardening trend and it's true, these price eﬀects across the whole portfolio motor
property construction liability. So I think it's more than inﬂation. Your second question,
sorry, I didn't --

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

The second question -- yeah, the second question was with respect to the cash
upstreaming from subsidiaries. Now I remember, you mentioned that a lot of the cash
upstreaming that you think for the year comes in the ﬁrst quarter. So can you give us any
percentage of how much of cash upstreaming has already come through? And how does
that compare to last year?

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

So I will -- so the big part is in 1H for sure, and I will not give you the amount of cash we
have today, but it's, in a nutshell, if I take the cash we have today, and I subtract the

Page 17 of 20

dividend to be paid, we would be at least at the range of our long-term target. If you see
what I mean.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

Q - Andrew Sinclair

{BIO 17749036 <GO>}

Thanks. And just one ﬁnal follow-up for me. Actually, it's about the mandatory convertible
bond into the EQH shares, I think converts 10 days time on 15th of May. Just want to -- by
what time EQH share price means you probably have some EQH shares left after the
conversion? And I'd say I was really wondered what the impact on solvency from that
conversion and what would you planning to give us majority in EQH shares? Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Etienne Bouas-Laurent

{BIO 16523089 <GO>}

So I'd just tell you that based on the current share price, because the deﬁnitive calculation

shares of Equitable Holdings.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 21454754 <GO>}

Thank you, and wanted to it's tricky and I'm going to talk to cancers. When you have
arrive at CSO you probably saw from my gosh, it's complicated group and all these
moving parts so best be very careful. And now clearly after a year in the role that you're
talking any of the numbers, but it's clearly there's a lot of conﬁdence in the way you
present these numbers in the ceiling that seems good. When we have any of the potential
or the likely only conﬁrm change now, are we going to go through the same cycle again
of slight course and then kind of reintroduce conﬁdence? Or can we kind of assume that
the transfer will be absolutely seamless? I don't know how you can answer it, but I can't
not to ask it because it's kind of follow up, I did ask on COVID you said no other change.
My question was really to know how much of the curve that you've set aside? How much is
still unpaid that would give me and then the ﬁnal one is just bit lazy, I'm really sorry, what
is the long-term target for cash?

So Michael, a long-term target for cash is EUR1 billion to EUR3 billion. So, when I speak
about the at end of the range is EUR3 billion, right. So if I say above the upper end of the
range to both EUR3 billion. And your ﬁrst question, I think it's part of the questions you
ask rate into the reserve to COVID and some will be better answer at the half year
because then we will have a closing a proper closing of the accounts, it's diﬃcult for me
to comment in the Q1 on the level of reserves we will high level of accuracy and
granularity as you can understand.
And I remind you that we have gone through last year, a very speciﬁc year where we had
the COVID crisis. And second, there was the level of earnings at XL which was not at the
level we expected. There is two components where impacted us really last year. I don't
think that we are in the same context each year. If you can give you some comfort on my
level of conﬁdence and on tone, which will be used by my successor with whom I've been
working in very, very close relationship and in the relationship of trust, although the last
two years, I would say.
