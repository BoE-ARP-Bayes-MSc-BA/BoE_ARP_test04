{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this conference call on Sampo Group's 2017 results. I
am Jarmo Salonen, Head of Investor Relations at Sampo. And with me here, I have our
Group CEO and President, Kari Stadigh; Head of P&C Insurance, Torbjorn Magnusson;
and Group CFO, Peter Johansson. We'll have the same procedures as always, Kari will
start with the review of the 2017 and then we'll come back to your questions.
Let me remind you that you can follow this also on our website sampo.com/results -- sorry,
result, without the s. And a recorded version will be later available at that same address.
Now, I'll hand over to Kari. Kari, please.

Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Thank you, Jarmo, and welcome to the conference call on my behalf as well. Sampo had a
strong 2017, particularly the insurance operations performed well and produced record

results.
Combined ratio for If in the fourth quarter amounted to 83.6%, which is the best ever
fourth quarter combined ratio. It is also noteworthy that the number of customers
increased in all geographies for If, which is not very common thing, however, a very
positive one. Also, Topdanmark delivered an excellent result, the combined ratio at 82.1%
in the fourth quarter. Based on the strong results, the Board of Topdanmark proposes a
dividend of DKK19 per share, which converts to a dividend or EUR107 million for Sampo,
payable during the spring.

Bloomberg Transcript

The high payout ratio combined with the buyback that Topdanmark executed last spring
before the AGM make up a total distribution ratio of 122% for Topdanmark during 2017.
You have also probably all noted that Topdanmark got the new CEO, Peter Hermann
earlier this month. Sampo share of Nordea's fourth quarter net proﬁt decreased to EUR126
million, a clear disappointment. However, our conﬁdence in the platform is still there.
Nordea started to deliver on costs for the ﬁrst time in the fourth quarter. Part of the weak
top line was based on owner decisions such as derisking the Baltic operations into a joint
venture, further taking down the volume in Nordea, Russia as well as de-risking the oil and
oﬀshore portfolio. The Nordea platform will also include becoming the gatekeeper, i.e.
the preferred partner for new FinTech companies as well as for the global players like
Apple Pay. And this will eventually diﬀerentiate the client oﬀering going forward. This is
not very common in the Nordics. Today, I think that the client oﬀering between the Nordic
banks is almost the same. I predict that two to four years from now, this will be a very
diﬀerent scene indeed and Nordea will be the leader. So all-in-all, Nordea will deliver
even if it has taken more time than originally planned.
Mandatum Life's proﬁt increased to EUR56 million for the fourth quarter. And what is even
more important is that Mandatum Life was able to lower the discount rate to 0.25% for
2018, '19 and '20, as well as to 2.75% for '19, '20 -- 2021, thus, forming a strong base for
good performance, also for the coming years. The buﬀer in total is EUR325 million. We
have seen the ﬁrst phase of rising interest rates in the last few weeks. Our insurance
operations with a very short ﬁxed income duration as well as a high cash position is well
positioned to outperform our peers, when this development will accelerate further.
In the short term, the lower running yield we will of course burden our investment results.
We are at an inﬂection point. We propose a dividend of 2.6 years, which is in total,
EUR1.444 million. Accounting together our internal dividends, starting with EUR620
million from last December to Topdanmark, Mandatum and Nordea paying their
dividends this spring. The totality exceeds the dividend which has to be paid. I think the
proposal is very prudent indeed. As you all remember, we are a dividend stock.
Thank you, got it. And Operator, we are now ready for your questions.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Hello, it's Jakob from Nordea. I have three questions please. The ﬁrst one coming back to
what you just said, Kari, about your dividends in 2017 and the cash ﬂow from subsidiaries.
First of all, I seem to recall that in early 2017, you mentioned that we should expect a lower
or more moderate dividend growth going forward, but actually, it was double the level of
in 2017. So could you just put a few words on what actually happened?
And then secondly, I guess we could end in a scenario where the cash ﬂow will be lower
in 2018. So, how should we then look at your dividend in 2018? Could that come down or
do you still expect it to go up over time?
And then ﬁnally, on non-life insurance, I see that both gross and net reserve releases have
been somewhat higher in 2017 than in previous years. Should we still expect around 1.5
percentage point support from reserve releases going forward or has that number maybe
increased a bit? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Okay. Maybe I'll start and Torbjorn takes then the non-life questions. Of course, we are
fully committed to growing dividends. I think that our cash generation is so strong and
internal dividends are strong, there is no reason why we couldn't increase the dividend
also going forward. However, I want to guide the same way I did for this year and don't
expect it to grow as fast as in earlier years. The absolute number is becoming so big that it
will look graphically beautiful even if it starts to plateau oﬀ, but yes, we are committed to
an increasing dividend.
Why was the dividend 260 this year? I think that when we made the proposal to the Board
and the Board then conﬁrmed it, we were in a good mood. We see that the future looks
promising, we see that our insurance operations are stronger than ever and we believe
also that the platform in Nordea will deliver in the coming years. And then, we also put
some hope in the new investments in Sampo plc. So all in all, I think it was a day of
conﬁdence when we decided on this. But, as stated earlier, don't get too excited.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Reserve releases, the 1.5 that you quote was not a guidance, but rather an observation
from some time ago, but with this low inﬂation, we will see some reserve releases around
that number. And the resulting strength that we have today is at the same level as we had
at the beginning of last year. So I have no further guidance to give them out.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Many thanks, both of you.

Q - Ida Melvold Gjosund

{BIO 19788453 <GO>}

Good afternoon, it's Ida from Carnegie, and I have a few questions please. First the
continued negative growth in Finland, I remember from last year that you said, that you
expected a more stable development in the Finnish market going forward. Is this still the
case? And if not, how do you see the Finnish market developing going forward both in
private and in corporate, please?
And secondly, on the Norwegian business, you saw a signiﬁcant growth in premiums this
quarter. I know you have done some product developments and reorganized the sales
team in Norway, but could you perhaps elaborate -- update on which products are driving
this positive development and in which market? Thanks.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Finnish market, I think I was wrong 18 months ago that, that would be stable in 2017,
because at the -- I think we discussed a few months -- a few quarters ago, the beginning
of the year we saw some price activity in the market, and that price activity led to a
lowered motor rate on average in the Finnish market. We've done well in this environment
and we've been patient, we have reacted with our modern distribution channels and we
have increased the number of customers at the end of the year and increased market
share with continued good proﬁtability.
But there has been some turbulence that's what you're seeing. Then in the Finnish
economy of course as you know, we now, at the end of the year, see some growth and
some optimism for the future and that has been reﬂected in the gross written premiums in
the fourth quarter, the GDP growth in Finland is helpful.
Norwegian growth comes from several factors. I think the most important one being our
investments in digitalization over the past few years, where we see an increased number
of customers coming in the web and alliance agreements. Yeah, that's probably it.

Q - Ida Melvold Gjosund

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Hello, good afternoon. This is Thomas Seidl from Bernstein. Three questions. First, I come
back to the dividend. Kari, you said you were in a good mood. So you increased the
payout from the dividends from usually 85%, 90% to -- close to a 100%. My question is
now, assuming that the total contribution based on your chart on page 73, next year could
be at similar level. So would you consider even going a signiﬁcant above a 100% payout
Page 4 of 18

FINAL

based on the dividends you received to get the dividend growing or is basically a 100%
ceiling on the dividend?
Secondly, and maybe related to this, can you remind us on Nordea, the renormalization to
Finland. Can we expect a special dividend from this exercise from the lower capital
requirement? And thirdly, maybe for Torbjorn, I think three, four years ago, you showed us
a nice chart showing how underwriting margins and investment margins are sort of
correlated. It was three to one relationship and I must say the Nordic markets have
executed this to perfection now with investment income as Kari said in selecting should
be healthy also underwriting margin now going down because the lower interest -- the
higher interest rates are now priced in the P&C?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Maybe I'll start oﬀ with Nordea. I can't of course comment on Nordea's -- for Nordea's
management on Board, as a single Board member. But from the owner's perspective, we
wouldn't like to see any extra dividends in Nordea. As the main owner of Nordea, I think
that we would like to see and prefer a dividend history. And if I recall correctly, Nordea
has guided themselves that they would like to increase the dividend gradually every year.
So, we support that we don't really believe in these extra dividends. About the payout
ratio, 100% or so, I don't think that, that is the main issue. Of course, we would like to
receive dividends from our subsidiaries, which we then could pass on to our owners. If
there was one year when we would see high volatility or some negative surprises, I don't
think that, that would hinder us from continuing building the dividend history. I would turn
it around like this. So with a very humble attitude, I think we are very convinced that we
are able to increase the dividend also moderately every year going forward. We have
ample resources, then because we are strongly capitalized and because we can of course
issue hybrids in our subsidiaries if necessary.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

On underwriting margin, let me point out three characteristics of the Nordic markets. First
of all, as you pointed out, they are rational. And they have been rational for a period and
they are rational. Secondly, they have been even further consolidated with the Tryg
acquisition of Forsikring. And thirdly, underwriting margins change slowly and gradually,
not overnight. So, it is a bit early to say -- say something about changes to them at the
moment.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

But there is a possibility and there is a debate, I'm seeing a little bit that in the Nordics,
you maintain those very high underwriting margins which were in a way the result of low
interest rate and now, on top of that, you get rising investment income. So, like the best of
two growth.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

I wouldn't like to speculate about this.

FINAL

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Yeah. And then I think that before we start to swim in money here, I think that the interest
rates really have to increase a lot. So if -- let's wait and see, if we ﬁrst get positive interest
rates and that there is something to share, then I think that's the ﬁrst phase and then let's
see. You must remember that as a group, we beneﬁt from the rising interest rates,
because we are part-owner of a bank, which would then get the deposit margin and also - of course, it would aﬀect our discounting rates. So, it's not only investments that we are
talking of here, but we have to see much more movement before it aﬀects this.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

All right, Thanks very much.

Q - Wajahat Rizvi

{BIO 19928187 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi, Wajahat Rizvi from Deutsche Bank. I have two quick questions for you. Firstly, can you
please help me understand the movement in excess capital in -- on the S&P basis. I've
noticed that the buﬀer now is only EUR300 million this year versus EUR600 million at the
end of 2016. And does this have any implication for future remittances from If?
And secondly, can you please talk about the changes you have made to the no claims
bonus discount structure in Norway. We have heard from other -- some of your
competitors that, that may actually increase frequency of smaller claims in that market?
Thank you very much.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

On the S&P model, the simple fact that the buﬀer shrink came down in December is that
we took the dividend from If.

Q - Wajahat Rizvi

{BIO 19928187 <GO>}

But -- so the dividend from If are broadly equal to like the proﬁt after tax from the
business. I was just wondering why the buﬀer has reduced year-on-year from 2016?

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

It's still the dividend, we took a higher dividend from If.

Q - Wajahat Rizvi

{BIO 19928187 <GO>}

Okay. And do you think this lower buﬀer, will have any implication for future remittances
from If?

A - Kari Stadigh

FINAL

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

The no claims bonus change, I am a bit surprised at hearing comments about that, it's
been changed by many companies in the market and has been changed this autumn. So
it doesn't have any big eﬀect at all at this point in time and it will not have any big eﬀects
going forward either.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Yes, it's Matti Ahokas here from Danske. Question on the partial internal model of If, now
you're reporting again the ﬁgure, which I think is very nice, thank you for that. The ﬁgure is
extremely high at 297, what would be a kind of good level or target level for this ﬁgure in
your opinion. And the other question is regarding the investment income in If, would you
say that the Q4 investment income was kind of a normalized investment income quarter in
your opinion? Thanks.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

This is Jarmo, if I may start, the 297 is an error, it should 257. So, sorry to disappoint you.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Still very high if they are a target.

A - Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

Yeah, it's still very high, agreed, yes.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

And let me -- yeah, the model including Finland approval before we start thanking about
what is going to look like later.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

The investment income, I think, is quite ordinary in Q4. You must also count -- take into
account that now the running yield is as low as it probably will get, we are at 1.5% in If. So
Page 7 of 18



Company Name: Sampo Oyj

it's signiﬁcantly lower when we started last year.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

FINAL

So, if I may come back on the internal model. So the 257 is -- assuming that the Finnish
business is included in the internal model or would this ﬁgure change with the approval.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

We haven't got it approved, so we cannot say whether it will change or not.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Hi there. Tough questions, please. Firstly, just wanted to touch on Topdanmark and
obviously your holding there. You've kind of alluded before to the fact that you think the
share price is perhaps over valued to Topdanmark. Is there a point in which it becomes so
overvalued that you maybe -you want to move out on that position? And/or what are your future plans for that
business? And then the second question was just looking at, if -- and the fact that you -we had I think record combined ratio certainly in Q4 for the whole year. And are we
reaching a point where the combined ratio can't get better or is there still scope to
improve that going forward? Are we kind of looking at operating earnings just coming
from investment income in If going forward? Thanks.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Our Topdanmark shareholding, maybe I take that one. We are now the main shareholder
of Topdanmark and that means also that we are responsible for the company and we have
allocated our top resources to the Board. We have no plans to dispose oﬀ that holding,
we are a long-term owner and it's our core business. I don't want to speculate at which
level we would be a buyer and increase our shareholding. At the moment, and lately, we
have not been buying any shares. So that's an indication that at these levels, we are not a
buyer.

I will always strive to improve the combined ratio is the simple answer. But of course, last
year, it was a good year when it came to natural events. It was -- it was a very good winter
that was a -- it was a very good winter, that was helpful, the lack of winter. And we had
decent prior games to help the -- and combined ratio.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

I think, it was at the turbulence, so that already last year we said that we are quite
defensive. We are -- given that there could be adverse winters, there could be things like
that, that we enjoyed a good environment also last year.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Hello, it's Michael Huttner from J.P. Morgan. I had three questions, one is on interest rate
sensitivities and you said it's very positive that -- and you mentioned several factors. I just
wondered whether you can walk us in detail through the proﬁt and loss accounts kind of
sensitivity over the next two or three years, year-by-year, that'd be very -- hugely helpful?
And then you said the -- you beneﬁted from mild weather in 2017, I just wonder if you can
put a ﬁgure to that. What would be the normal weather cost selective to last year with it?
And the ﬁnal question is on Nordea. My colleague here is not as convinced as your
outlook on Nordea is about to improve. And speciﬁcally, since you said, Nordea needs to
invest a lot, which basically would mean lower dividends for a while. Is that what you
alluded to when you said you'd be ready to grow your dividend, even if not all your
subsidiaries were contributing every year? Thank you.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

I have -- maybe I'll start oﬀ with the Nordea one. I have no reason to believe that the
Nordea cannot live up to its guidance, and the guidance is that Nordea will increase its
dividend.

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

I'll try to answer the two questions without maybe going through P&L accounts over the
phone. But 2017 was not an eventful year in the markets. We have roughly the same
players that as we had at the beginning of the year. No newcomers, no disruptive
technology, so what we're looking at going forward is low claims inﬂation we've had in the
past few years. That's what we're seeing at the moment. We have low rate increases
matching that. We have, as I mentioned earlier, the same reserving strength and no
meaningful changes then to competition, and then we had a year of good weather and a
little bit more large losses than expected last year. So that I think we'll have to prove
enough as a guidance.

Q - Michael Huttner

(Multiple Speakers) You don't have a ﬁgure for what would be a normal bad weather or
good weather?

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

I think its helpful to give just that when there are so many things that vary overtime in nonlife insurance.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

I think also culturally, when I tried to hear what Torbjorn is saying, he is in a way repeating
our old message that we focus on a low -- standard deviation in our combined ratio. We
value low volatility in our performance.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

I understand. Thank you. And in interest rates?

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Sorry?

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Interest rates, you alluded that there were lots of, you are very perfect, you have shorter
duration, these are wonderful things, and I just wondered whether you can break it down
in terms of your numbers?

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

I think it's up to you to convert it to numbers, because if you think of other --the interest
rates, we have interests, we are discounted with interest rates that are the same as our
competitors in most countries. In Finland, we have an interest rate that we have decided
by ourselves and that's 1.2%, right? So that is -- those are the numbers that change and
you have to assume then what would -- how would common increased rate change. For us
to release something from the 1.2, that would require a big change in interest rates, but
the ﬂuctuating interest rates, they move with the market. Then the second point is our
running yield, you know our duration and you know our running yield. So, then it's a
question when can we deploy the cash and at what rate. So it's, again, I think you are
called to calculate. And in Nordea --

Q - Michael Huttner

Thank you.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

We've published, very, very detailed information on that. And then the third thing which
aﬀects interest rates is the deposit margin in Nordea. And I haven't now lately seen what
they publish, but earlier they used to say it's --

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

EUR700 million to EUR800 million -- 100 basis points.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Yeah. So, a 100 basis points creates 700 million to 800 million on the bottom line in
deposit margin for Nordea and our ownership part is 21%. So, I think here you have the
parameters where you can -- and then we also give some sensitivity tables in the -- in the
package.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Yes, it's Per Gronborg from SCB. A couple of questions from my side. First of all, a bit of
early to a previous question on -- if you look at the top line, very strong performance in
Sweden, quite a softer performance in Finland. You addressed Finland and stated that the
written premium in Q4 had been recurring. When I look at the written premium on your
referred numbers is still down to 5.5% Q-o-Q in Q4. So, a few comments on those two
markets would be nice.
Second question is related to Mandatum. Just to get an understanding, if I look at your
book return on your new available for sale bonds has now been negative for the last three
quarters in row. You have a running yield between 2.4% and 2.8%. What is that is pushing
the book return down to this extent?

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

In Sweden, one of the factors that -- actually two of the things that help us is, ﬁrst of all, we
have modernized, the distribution quite a bit. Also in commercial lines, so we're gaining
customers also in commercial lines. But then, we have a very strong position with the car
industry and the car dealers, and Swedes are buying cars like never before. So that helps
our top line. And in Finland, you are quite right. The -- as I mentioned, the average motor
premium, motor rate has come down, and that is visible in our premium numbers. But

we're gaining customers, we're gaining market share and we're coming from an
exceptionally low combined ratio, so we are still very proﬁtable and we will be able to
balance the changing rates with other products -- other countries just as we usually do.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Hey, good afternoon. It's Blair Stewart here from Bank of America. I have only got a
couple left. The -- I noticed through the AGM, you've got an approval to repurchase, I
think it's 9% of the shares. Is that just the ordinary approval that you normally get but
seldom use or do you have ﬁrm plans to actually execute that buyback in the coming 12 to
18 months? Secondly, just on the proceeds from the life disposal later this year, and I just
wonder if you could share some updated thoughts on how you might use those
proceeds? And ﬁnally, just on the investment yields, et cetera, just over the last quarter or
so, there has been a bit of volatility in markets. Kari, have you found anything interesting
on the investment side that's interested to you enough to actually invest? Thank you.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

On the investment side, I think that the volatility peak was so short that we have time to do
something minuscule, but nothing, which will change the needle. On the life proceeds,
there is nothing in the pipeline, but of course Mandatum has the ability to deploy the
capital, if they ﬁnd some interesting M&A. If not they will repatriate the money either
immediately or over time to the parent. The buybacks is completely unordinary. We have
no plans at this moment to use it. However, it's worth noting that the number of shares in
some points now diﬀerent, it's 555 million roughly share. So we redeemed the paper
shares that where we didn't ﬁnd deal in there. So most of you have already noted that we
have a new number of shares.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant

FINAL

Good afternoon, everyone. I've got two questions, please. Firstly on premiums, I mean,
premiums grew by close to 2% after two years of almost ﬂat premium. Can you just tell us
how this splits between volume and pricing and whether you think the 2% is the run rate
going forward? And secondly, just on the claims trends, I mean across the portfolio, can
you still price in line with claims inﬂation? Thank you.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Yes, we price in line with claims inﬂation. And the increase of 1.8% -- no, since the rate
increases are so small, it's a portion of this, but only a small portion.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Okay, cool. And can I can ask one more question just on the running yield. Because I think
you mentioned that it's declined to 1.5% now on the ﬁxed income portfolio, is that the
level which is sustainable going forward or should it continue to decline slightly?

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

It's diﬃcult to say, it depends on when the interest rates will go up or the yield curve
movements and what kind of opportunities there are. So it's diﬃcult to say. We are
certainly close to the bottom, but whether this is a situation where we have to bridge the
pain with further decline in that, I don't really know, close to the bottom I think we are at
least.

Q - Steven Haywood

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Hello. Steven Haywood from HSBC. Two questions please. The Mandatum Life portfolio
that's being sold to Danske. Could you tell us, or could you retell us, what the gain is that
you'll seeing on this, the gain that actually comes through the income statement? And my
second question on the M&A side of things. In terms of Nordic normalized markets, now
about Tryg has acquired Alka, do you think there is any more opportunities in any of the
Nordic markets for further acquisitions, further deals to be done by yourself or by any
other competitors? Thank you.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

I think that the mega trend or further consolidation is always there. So the main players
clearly have an appetite to consolidate further, whether there are opportunities or not, I
can't really tell you. The situation is of course such that as we are very strongly capitalized
and we are known to be quick decision makers, everything that moves in the Nordics is

the ﬁnancial sector. It's not possible to predictive of anything of the pipeline at the
moment. The Danske capital gain, Peter --

another EUR80 million.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes, good afternoon. This is Vinit from Mediobanca. So several questions have been
answered, but just can I still clarify a few things please. One is on the equity markets, I
mean your equity exposure in If and also Mandatum is quite high, and obviously, it's a
good thing in rising markets, but is there any intention to hedge it, moderate it? And the
reason I ask is that in fourth quarter, we saw fairly material right down in return I
understand, but just trying to understand how you look at equity market risk in your
balance sheet. And second question is, just on the Mandatum internal dividend, I
remember the old days when you used to have 100 million in two years, and already
between March to March, it will be 425 or so. I know there is a one-oﬀ into September.
But is there something in Mandatum that we should think, continues to see a
progressively higher internal dividend in the future as well? Thank you.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

FINAL

Well, I think that the -- it's likely that we can maintain the dividend at these levels or
potentially even increase it. And why is that the case? Well the main reason is of course
that we have discounted the -- this year and the next two ones, three years in a row at
0.25. So given a moderate investment income that creates value. And then as you saw
from our results, the risk and cost result -- expense result, they are at all-time high 66
million -- 68 million together. And a part of that is of course lost with the Danske portfolio,
but that's still a strong result.
And then as to third point, you all remember that our -- with proﬁt portfolio is decreasing
by roughly 200 million a year which releases also 50 million. So I think that dividend on
these level or slightly above this level is a good prediction on how it will go. On our equity
appetite, I think that we have two diﬀerent animals here, one is If, where the rating is
determining the appetite for risk. And yes, we are strongly reserved at this moment, our
rating numbers are very strong, but I think that we maintain this level of equity risk in If. In
Mandatum, I would say that this is a full equity risk, we don't foresee that we would
increase the equity risk. U.S. equities seem to be higher valued than Europeans. So our
expectation is to maintain as long as we see this interest rate forecast, at the present levels
we would maintain our European equity levels at the present. We did a sale oﬀ in
December, so we -over a EUR150 million. That maybe shows that we are -- the exposure is where we want it
to be now.

Q - Unidentiﬁed Participant
Hello, good afternoon. My couple of follow-ups for Torbjorn on my side. In Finland is the
legal case with Pohjola still unresolved? And I guess you (inaudible) reason on user? And
in Norway, you said there are impact of the claims bonus, change has no big eﬀects. Is
that through more for you, the big players and maybe a bit less true for the smaller player
for which is the new system is more diﬃcult and therefore maybe should help avoiding
further losses of market share of the bigger players in the market over time? And then a

FINAL

question for Kari. You -- we saw the Saxo Bank deal, I think it was Q3 if I remember
correctly. And then September, you mentioned that those type of things you'd be
spending a little bit more time on as way to -- as ways to deploy your capital ﬂexibility. Is
that still the case, are you still spending some time on those type -- or looking at least
those type of transactions and even if maybe not executing depending on price?

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Maybe I'll start then we Saxo and those. I think that we have -- we have now deployed 500
million in the parent. And I think that we have an appetite to deploy up to 1 billion. So yes,
we are still looking for investment opportunities in the Nordic ﬁnancial arena. And then,
your second question before Torbjorn answers about the legal case, I just want to use the
right wording, we have no legal case. So, we have just ask the competitive, competition
authorities, whether a colleague of ours has a dominant market share? That's question
one. Then we have asked a second question, if they have a dominant market share, are
they misusing it? So we have just put forward two questions to the authorities. We are part
of no legal case in that sense, or a legal dispute.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

That bigger case is still open as you point out. And then on Norway, I think this -- as I
hinted at, this change in the terms is receiving too far too much attention. We change the
terms and conditions regularly, so do our competitors whether this is important to small
or big competitors? Yes, it is possible that is more diﬃcult for small competitors to change
their IT systems, if they are a bit more rudimentary than ours. There are many ways you
can change both terms and prices. So, from my side, I wouldn't pay too much attention to
this change.
