All right. Thanks, Dennis. Good morning, everyone.
I'd like to ﬁrst make some comments on the acquisition before moving to the Q1 results.
So this morning, we announced an agreement to purchase JEVCO Insurance Company
from the Westaim Corporation for a total consideration of CAD530 million.
We believe that this acquisition is an attractive deployment of our capital, provides strong
strategic ﬁt and is ﬁnancially compelling.
From a strategic point of view, the most important beneﬁt for us is the ability to strengthen
our oﬀer to brokers and customers. The addition of JEVCO will extend our product
oﬀering into recreational vehicles and non-standard auto. And also strengthen our
commercial and specialty lines capabilities.
We believe there are opportunities for us to improve the performance of the business by
implementing a risk selection and claims management expertise. And further we expect
to be able to leverage our broad distribution platform in conjunction with the
complementary products to improve our growth proﬁle.
I'll let Mark walk you through the ﬁnancial metrics in a few minutes. But to summarize, I
believe our strong ﬁnancial position is maintained following the acquisition, which aﬀords
us the ﬂexibility to continue on our journey towards building a world-class P&C insurer.
Moving on to the earnings results, last night, we announced a First Quarter net operating
income of CAD179 million or CAD1.34 per share; that is 47% higher than a year ago, a
Page 2 of 14

solid start to the year.

FINAL

Continued positive results from our action plans combined with exceptionally mild winter
conditions led to an underwriting performance in Q1 2012 with a combined ratio of 92.3%.
From a top-line perspective we reported premium growth of nearly 50% for a second
consecutive quarter, reﬂecting the addition of AXA Canada as well as organic growth.
Thus far customer retention is strong. And we should have more clarity on a sustainable
level of retention by our next quarterly conference call.
Overall our underwriting performance and steady investment income resulted in an
operating ROE of 16.2%, while book value per share increased 13% from a year earlier.
Our outlook for the industry remains unchanged as 2011 played out largely as we
anticipated. During the year, the industry recorded 4% premium growth in auto, driven by
Ontario, 7% in personal property in reaction to years of heavy weather-related losses. And
3% in commercial lines.

Bloomberg Transcript

As the drivers behind this growth will likely continue to impact 2012, we expect similar
growth in the coming 12 months. The low interest rate environment and reinsurance
market conditions should support our outlook. And will likely lead to ﬁrmer conditions
over time.
From an underwriting perspective the industry ended 2011 with a combined ratio of 100%.
For 2012, we anticipate some improvement from personal auto resulting from reforms in
Ontario as well as continued premium increases. And personal property resulting from
mild weather conditions experienced in the First Quarter and continued premium
increases as well.
We do not anticipate a loss ratio improvement in commercial lines but expect pricing
conditions to improve at a moderate pace over time, following several years of soft
industry pricing. So that was an industry perspective, just to be clear.
Finally, looking at the industry's ROE, we do not expect material improvement in the near
term from the 6% level experienced in 2011. Although underwriting performance may
improve modestly, we anticipate this would largely be oﬀset by the negative impact on
investment income from the low yield environment.
Looking speciﬁcally at Intact Financial, we strongly believe we'll continue to outperform
the industry's ROE by more than 500 basis points in 2012.
Turning to Ontario auto, we remain conﬁdent that the beneﬁts from the reforms and our
actions will materialize as previously outlined. But we remain prudent and disciplined in
this market. We have been very active in managing our ﬁles being disputed through
mediation. And as a result our backlog has declined by more than 25% since the peak in
2011. At the industry level, a signiﬁcant mediation backlog of about one year continues to
Page 3 of 14

exist. The size of this backlog maintains a fair level of uncertainty with respect to the
interpretation of new regulations implemented through the reforms.

FINAL

According to industry results the loss ratio in Ontario auto for 2011, excluding Intact
Financial, improved by about 19 points from a year earlier to 84%. That is loss ratio we are
talking about. The improvement, while impressive, was aided by a signiﬁcant level of
favorable prior-year claims development in addition to continued rate increases.
In the First Quarter of 2012 the Financial Services Commission of Ontario approved rate
decreases of 0.2%. In total, industry rate increases have amounted to 7.2% since the
reforms, despite their beneﬁcial impact.
In personal property, beneﬁts from our actions to improve results and the mild winter
conditions resulted in a combined ratio of 83.5%. Despite two consecutive quarters of
very strong results in this line of business, we maintain our focus on the actions already
taken and continue to monitor and adapt to the increasing level of severe weather
occurrences to really create a sustainable competitive advantage.

Bloomberg Transcript

Pricing conditions in commercial lines remain soft. But we remain focused. From a growth
perspective our results in commercial lines are beginning to reﬂect our value proposition,
which includes a broader product suite and maintaining the outer boundary of Intact and
AXA risk appetite, as well as a continued focus on small and medium-sized businesses.
Let me make a few comments about the AXA integration. With over 300,000 personal
lines policies and 40,000 commercial lines policies already converted, I am very
comfortable saying that our integration is on track. This is a true testament to the hard
work of countless individuals from across the organization who have come together to
ensure our brokers and customers embrace our oﬀer and continue to receive top-notch
service.
In fact, I'm very proud to say that according to recent survey results our national broker
satisfaction rate is at an all-time high. And almost every region saw an increase in results
versus the prior year.
In planning for the JEVCO integration, a key principle is to ensure that there will be no
disruption to the AXA integration, nor to the high level of service we currently provide to
brokers and customers.
So in conclusion the strong performance we delivered throughout 2011 carried over into
the early months of this year. I believe the importance we place on underwriting results
will continue to serve us well in the current low interest rate environment. Given the
quality of our operational platforms, the ﬂexibility provided by our ﬁnancial position. And
the combination with AXA Canada, we believe that we will continue to outperform the
industry and strengthen our leadership position. With that, I'll now turn the call to our
CFO, Mr. Tullis.

Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Thank you, Charles. First a few comments related to our acquisition of JEVCO. We
estimate an IRR on equity returns from the acquisition, which is our primary metric when
we measure potential targets, of more than 20%. We also expect the deal to be accretive
to net operating income per share beginning in 2013 and to provide 2.6% book value
accretion. We intend to ﬁnance the acquisition through a combination of equity by way of
our CAD226 million subscription receipt issuance, internal excess capital and debt as well
as excess capital inside JEVCO that will become available following the close of the
transaction.
Following the close of the transaction we expect our MCT to remain above 200%. And
our debt to total capital ratio to remain below 20%. The transaction, which is expected to
close this fall, has been approved by the boards of both companies and is conditional
upon the approval of Westaim shareholders and the receipt of the required regulatory
authorities. Alberta investment Management Corp., Goodwood Inc. and the directors and
executive oﬃcers of Westaim and JEVCO have agreed to vote their Westaim shares in
favor of the transaction. These holdings represent in aggregate around 48% of the
outstanding common shares and just over 57% of the shares which are entitled to vote at
the special meeting of Westaim shareholders.

Bloomberg Transcript

Moving to the Q1 results, last night we announced net operating income per share of
CAD1.34, reﬂecting exceptionally good underwriting results on the heels of very mild
winter conditions. Earnings per share of CAD1.33 were down from CAD1.42 a year ago,
reﬂecting restructuring and integration expenses as well as the remaining AXA France
contingent consideration.
On an adjusted basis, excluding acquisition-related items, we recorded EPS of CAD1.59,
up from CAD1.43 a year ago. Top-line growth continues to be excellent at 49%. As Charles
mentioned, AXA retention has been strong. But the ultimate level of retention will not be
fully visible until later in the year.
Our organic growth beneﬁted from the continued acceleration in the growth of our direct
auto business from negative 4% in Q3 2011 to positive 4% in Q4 2011 and 7% this quarter.
Slides 8 and 9 show results by line of business. In personal auto premium growth
beneﬁted from the addition of AXA, as well as organic growth. As AXA's auto business
had a larger percentage of lower-premium Quebec business, our unit growth was even
stronger than the premium growth. At 95.2% our combined ratio was 2.5 points better
than a year ago as current-year results were helped by a 10% drop in claims frequency,
reﬂecting the mild winter conditions.
In personal property lower frequency of claims due to the mild winter, as well as due to
our actions to improve results, produced an exceptionally strong 83.5% combined ratio,
almost 9 points better than a year ago.

FINAL

AXA's contribution was once again most evident in the commercial lines business with a
premium growth at 78%. The commercial auto combined ratio was a very strong 85.2%.
But in commercial P&C, results were impacted by an elevated level of large losses,
including non-weather ﬁre-related losses. The combined ratio for commercial P&C was
97.6%.
Our eﬀective tax rate for the quarter was 20.5%, down from 24.3% in 2011. Lower
corporate tax rates, primarily at the federal level, accounted for 1.7% of the drop. There
was another 1.7% reduction due to a higher percentage of non-taxable income. About half
of the second 1.7% improvement is timing. But the other half reﬂects a structural change
due to the diﬀerent mix of business within AXA Canada.
Our expense ratio increased from 30.3% to 32.6%, reﬂecting higher proﬁt-sharing
commission as well as the percentage of higher commission commercial business within
the AXA block.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the investment side, net investment income of CAD100 million in the First Quarter was
up 37% from a year ago due to the additional investments related to AXA Canada.
However, declining yields continue to oﬀset the underlying asset growth. We expect the
lower interest rates to continue to negatively impact our market-based yield in the coming
quarters.
Our ﬁnancial position remained strong at the end of the quarter with an MCT of 205%,
CAD595 million in excess capital and book value per share of CAD30.40, 13% higher than
a year ago. We allocated CAD250 million of proceeds from the sale of AXA's life
insurance business toward reducing debt. As a result, our debt to total capital ratio is now
19%, within our target of 20%.
As Charles mentioned the integration of AXA Canada continues to be on track and we
expect to continue the integration -- complete the integration by mid-2013. We maintain
our CAD100 million after synergies -- after-tax synergies target and expect to reach this
run rate progressively by the second half of 2013. We are on plan with a CAD36 million
run rate already secured in 2012 and a CAD50 million run rate expected by the end of the
year.
During the First Quarter we recorded CAD23 million of restructuring and integration
expenses. And we expect a level similar or lower for the remaining quarters of 2012.
In summary our disciplined pricing, underwriting, investment and capital management
have positioned us well for the future. With the progress made to date on the AXA
integration. And today's announced acquisition of JEVCO, we feel we are well on the way
toward building a world-class P&C insurer. With that I'll turn the call back to Dennis.

Questions And Answers

FINAL

Operator
(Operator Instructions) Andre Hardy.

Q - Andre Hardy
Good morning. I have two questions and they both relate to the auto business. The ﬁrst is,
in the MD&A you talk about results improving by 5.5 points on a year-over-year basis on
the current-year -- accident-year basis. That seemed largely driven by the positive impact
of weather and frequency. Is that right? And if it is right, why did you not beneﬁt more
from Ontario reform and company actions? I didn't get the sense that you'd seen the full
beneﬁts of those actions last year.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Martin will take that question.

A - Martin Beaulieu

{BIO 15316652 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes; in fact, we had -- we are estimating that the improvement that is coming from weather
is about 3 points in our auto portfolio. So when you say that there should have been more
come -- as well coming from the reforms, we are still seeing some progress there.

Q - Andre Hardy
Can you help us understand -- I mean a while back you had said that relative to 2010 you
expected reform to help by 6 points. And company actions to help by a similar amount.
How much of that you saw last year. And how much we should expect this year?

A - Martin Beaulieu

{BIO 15316652 <GO>}

Well the 12 points we have we had in our books at the end of 2011. So what we are looking
at now is that we would have maybe a few more points that we are starting to see in 2012.

Q - Andre Hardy
Okay. That's helpful, thank you. My other question is also on Ontario auto. You had a
pretty big drop in the number of cases in mediation. Yet I think we can infer from your
disclosures that you did not release more reserves than usual. Again, is that an accurate
statement? And if so why would you not release some reserves if you are seeing less
uncertainty in your open cases?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

That's an accurate statement. And I think it goes back to the fact that the improvement in
the case anchored at the ﬁle level is very strong. In our view there is still uncertainty even
Page 7 of 14



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2012-05-02

FINAL

though the backlog has dropped by 25%. And therefore we remain cautious in that
market (oddly) at this stage.
We are working hard at closing those mediation ﬁles. But don't forget that there is the
impact on the ﬁles that you close. But the uncertainty associated with the mediation per
se can have an impact on many of the open ﬁles. So even if you close a quarter of the
ﬁles, there are still a fair bit of open ﬁles that are being mediated. And therefore the
uncertainty is still there. I think we are going as fast as we can to reduce our backlog. But
the industry that exists or the uncertainty that exists in Ontario auto is not only related to
our backlog; it's related to the backlog of the industry in general, which has not dropped,
has actually increased.

A - Martin Beaulieu

{BIO 15316652 <GO>}

And what I could add there is that what has been the reduction in the mediation pending
ﬁles in our portfolio has been resolved outside of the mediation process. So what is being
mediated is still out there.

Q - Andre Hardy
That's very helpful. Thank you.

Tom MacKinnon.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. A couple questions here. I've noticed the
expense ratio kind of ticked up nearly 2 points quarter over quarter. And was kind of
wondering what's been driving that. Then I've got a follow-up.

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Sure. And I think it's two things, Tom. Say a bit half, a little more than half of it is due to
increase in contingent proﬁt commissions year over year because of the good results. The
rest is because of the mix of business, primarily the commercial business. But a little bit
the Quebec business as well -- AXA versus Intact.
So let me give you a few numbers to sort of put that in perspective. If you look at Intact's
2011 expense ratio for 2011, for commercial lines it was a little over 36%, for personal lines
it was a little over 28%. So you can see the diﬀerence in the expenses between
commercial and personal. Of course in combined ratio it works out because the loss ratios
are diﬀerent. But as we pick up more of the -- relatively more of the commercial business
from AXA it's going to shift the expense ratio.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay. So we should probably see somewhere around this level continuing? It's strictly due
to the mix and as the mix changes --?
Page 8 of 14



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2012-05-02

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

That's due to commissions. And the oﬀset, Tom, is the pricing works out. So you'll see the
oﬀset on the loss ratio side a bit. But what you'll see is a shift with the change in mix
toward a bit heavier on the commissions.

FINAL

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I think what bakes in prospectively is all the synergies, obviously.

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Correct. On the general expense side you see a drop. But you see that increased on the
commission side.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Exactly right.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Oh, okay. So a little bit of the synergies have come down to knock this down. But as I
understand it, as the business mix moves more toward commercial, then that might be -that works the other way to some extent.

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

The expense ratio will go up. But you should see an oﬀsetting oﬀset on the loss ratio side.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay. And in the SIP on page -- or in the supplementary on page -- on Table 4, there is an
item called the distribution income. And that's running at a rate 3 times higher than we've
normally seen it.

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Right (multiple speakers) right. So I think there's two things going on there, Tom. So that
what that represents -- the increase represents two things. One is the inclusion of the AXA
brokers. As you remember when we purchased AXA, they included some brokerages
similar to some of the brokerages we owned.
If you look at the increase in the quarter, approximately half of that increase is due to the
inclusion of the AXA brokers within the -- so you consider half of that is permanent, half of
it is timing because it was a particularly good quarter for the brokerages. So I think you
could see sort of half of that increase over a year ago sort of run rate sort of stuﬀ; half of it
was because those outlets enjoyed a particularly good quarter from a timing point of
view.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Page 9 of 14



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2012-05-02

And your two questions are linked because the fact that our commissions went up and
proﬁt sharing went up because of good result means that our distribution units, such as
BrokerLink, received better commission income as a result of good (multiple speakers)

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Oh, okay.

A - Mark Tullis

Hence the timing.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

Half of it is just the base inclusion of the additional --

Right, yes.

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

-- business from AXA.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay. And If I could just squeeze one more in, the CAD595 million in excess, is that -- just
remind me what MCT level that is supposed to be over?

A - Mark Tullis

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

It's 170%.

Operator
Stephen Boland.

Q - Stephen Boland

{BIO 5546446 <GO>}

Well. Good morning. A couple questions, really mostly to do with the -- well ﬁrst one on
the acquisition. There was a runoﬀ business in Westaim, mostly long-haul trucking, I know
it depleted somewhat. Maybe you could just comment on that, how you've reviewed that.
And following on the -- they had talked about dabbling back into long-haul trucking
again. Is that a business line that you're thinking of sort of entering into?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

So I think we have to -- the band here of comment on the acquisition is very tight. And so
it's hard for me to comment on the ﬁrst part of your question.
The second part of your question, though, is that when you look at our commercial auto
results, there is trucking results. And maybe you want to comment, Alain, on our
commercial auto result.

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

Well we already are doing a trucking business across Canada in Quebec and Ontario and
western Canada. And we saw the JEVCO acquisition when we look at the strategic ﬁt as
also being improved. And increase our distribution and our capability in trucking and
Ontario business, which has proven to be part of our specialty line of proﬁtable business.

Q - Stephen Boland

{BIO 5546446 <GO>}

Okay. I guess a second question, Charles. And everyone sort of points to your
conservatism with Ontario auto and the outlook. And yet you're buying an acquisition
here that is nonstandard auto, predominately Ontario, meaning you are actually getting
more into the business, which I guess we could take that -- you have a very positive
outlook. But you're kind of being a little bit guarded about it.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Page 11 of 14



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2012-05-02

Yes, I think look -- let me just come back on the commercial auto comment. The combined
ratio, 85% in the quarter. And if you go back last year and the year before you'll see pretty
strong results there. So when it comes to commercial auto, we are quite positive about
that business and want to expand our presence as Alain was saying.

FINAL

Now moving on to Ontario automobile, of course I am guarded about Ontario
automobile because it's been a volatile business over time for the industry.
I am guarded about Ontario automobile because I talked on behalf of IFC. But I am
making comments about the industry as well. And as you know the industry is still
operating, despite the improvement we've talked about, despite the 19-point
improvement in loss ratio, the industry is still running north of 105. So I do think that one
needs to be guarded in one's comment.
I think that what is really important to understand, Stephen, is that we do outperform the
industry by a 13-point margin in Ontario. So I do believe we have a meaningful advantage
there. And I think in particular in claims management I do believe that a lot of value can
be created building on that basis. And I do believe that with that kind of advantage, we
are insulated to a certain extent or to a greater degree from the pain that the industry has
suﬀered over time in Ontario auto.

Bloomberg Transcript

And we've always said that from a strategic point of view we don't have a business mix or
provincial distribution target. Our target is to outperform as much as we can. And when
we are conﬁdent about our outperformance we'll do more of that. I think this is an
example this morning.

Q - Stephen Boland

{BIO 5546446 <GO>}

Okay. And no comment on the runoﬀ business? It's public that that business line was
there. And obviously you've done your diligence on it.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Oh, yes. We've done very deep due diligence, is what I will tell you.

Q - Stephen Boland

{BIO 5546446 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Q - Bryan Brown

{BIO 16358540 <GO>}

Good morning. This quarter we saw a quite strong favorable reserve development. And it
was slightly higher than last year. And just wanted to know if that had anything to do with
AXA's reserves.

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

FINAL

Just to put things in perspective, the prior-year development in the quarter was indeed
strong and stronger than one should expect over time. But not too far from what it was
last year.
I think there is a bit of seasonality in favorable development in general where Q1 tends to
be stronger quarter -- is the ﬁrst point I'll make.
You'll notice that we have accrued CAD11 million of contingent consideration for AXA.
And as you know those contingent considerations are driven by favorable development.
So AXA's reserves have had very good favorable development in the quarter, no doubt
about it. So we are quite pleased. When I say our acquisition is on track all of that is
embedded in our comment.

Okay. Great. And I guess with respect to JEVCO, if you have any details on their reserving
practices, or just how you view their reserving practices.

We are quite comfortable with their reserving practices. This is -- I mean it's a public
company. You've seen their results in the past two years. So you can assess from the
outside as well as we can. Then obviously. And I've mentioned that before, reserves is the
top area of due diligence for us. So I can assure you that a number of us have dug deep
on that side of the house. And the fact that we have announced the transaction this
morning is a sign of comfort with what they are doing on that side.

Q - Bryan Brown

{BIO 16358540 <GO>}

Okay. Great. That's it for me. Thank you.

Operator
(Operator Instructions) There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back to
the presenters.

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Well maybe we could answer Tom's third question. And we'll make sure that he gets less
one at the next earnings call.

{BIO 4180270 <GO>}

In fact, the CAD87 million which I recollected is correct; the excess million in excess of
200% is CAD87 million.
