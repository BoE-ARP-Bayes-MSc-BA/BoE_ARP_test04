Hello. Welcome to the Q3 '18 Direct Line Group Trading Update Call. My name is Molly.
And I'll be your coordinator for today's event. (Operator Instructions)
I will now hand you over to your host, CEO, Paul Geddes, to begin today's conference.
Thank you.

Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Welcome to our Q3 update. As usual, I'm joined
by Penny James and other members of my management team. Hopefully you've had a
chance to read our trading update and have your questions ready.
But ﬁrst, let me run you through the highlights. We delivered another robust trading
performance in Q3 as markets continued to be competitive. We believe our performance
reﬂects the value of our strong brands, propositions and customer relationships. Motor
and Home own brands performed well, both growing in-force policies. Our investments
in direct Commercial and Rescue helped them also to grow in-force policies by 7% and
11%, respectively. We're also pleased with the strategic progress we've made in the
quarter. And we're on track to begin the rollout of our new personal lines IT systems next
year. Overall, our strong trading performance means that we are reiterating our full year

and medium-term combined operating ratio target of between 93% and 95%, assuming
normal annual weather and no change to the Ogden discount rate.
So now for a few words on each of the business areas, starting with Motor. And at the end
of Q3, our view of the year's current year loss ratio hasn't changed materially from how we
described it at the half year. At the half year, we said that the market was rational, with
market premiums adjusting to reﬂect the changing Ogden outlook. We also said that
claims inﬂation have returned. During the quarter, market prices showed signs of
stabilizing. Against this, higher damage severity has led us to nudge up our view of
underlying claims inﬂation towards the top end of the 3% to 5% range. Weather eﬀects
also drove higher frequency this year after a very benign 2017 experience.
Against this backdrop, we put through some rate increases. Although not quite enough to
cover claims inﬂation in the quarter, the business we wrote was still at our target loss
ratios. Having priced a little ahead of the market, we're pleased that we still achieved
some growth. Our own brand policies grew 0.7% compared to Q2, taking year-on-year
growth to 3%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Low average premiums meant that our own brands' GWP was down a little compared with
last year as our price increases were more than oﬀset by a lower risk mix. This mix change
resulted from reﬁnements to our technical price models and to our pricing strategy -- and
to our promotional strategy, I should say. As usual, we'll continue to prioritize our target
loss ratios over volume.
Moving on to Home. We're pleased with the way we traded in Q3. Own brands policy
count was up a little. And average premiums were 1% ahead of Q3 last year. We achieved
good price increases on our new business and also improved retention a little in the
quarter. Most of the year-on-year variance in headline premium and policies continued to
be the runoﬀ of the Nationwide and Sainsbury's businesses.
Finally, a few words on the weather in the quarter. At the half year, we talked about the
potential for 2018 to be a subsidence year. But I'm pleased to report that our latest view
suggests subsidence claims, whilst higher, will not materially be higher than we would
normally expect.
Next, onto Rescue, where it was another strong quarter for our Green Flag brands, which
grew premiums 13.2% compared to last year. And in other personal lines, I'm delighted to
announce that we've just agreed to renew our travel partnership with Nationwide to
continue to supply travel insurance to their bank customers for another ﬁve years.
In Commercial, our investment in Direct Line for Business progressed well in the quarter
and remains in line with our plans. DL4B grew premiums 7.6% compared to last year.
Overall, Commercial premiums were ﬂat in the quarter as NIG exited several larger risks
when we weren't -- which we were not expected to meet our internal hurdle rates,
oﬀsetting the premium growth in DL4B.

FINAL

And now for the outlook, where our ongoing discipline gives us the conﬁdence that we
can achieve our combined operating ratio target of between 93% and 95% in 2018 and
over the medium term, supported by ongoing reductions in our cost and commission
ratios. This still seems at a normalized annual weather load and no change to the Ogden
discount rate. For investments, we continue to expect investment return of about GBP 150
million this year, boosted by GBP 30.5 million of gains that we recognized in the ﬁrst half.
So in summary, we're pleased with how we traded this quarter. Markets remain
competitive. And we maintain strong momentum across our own brand portfolio as we
continue to beneﬁt from our ongoing investments.
And with that, operator, we'll go to questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) The ﬁrst question comes from the line of Thomas Seidl calling from
Bernstein.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

First, on the Home, it seems pricing is less for you in the market. But you also note that the
claims inﬂation is 3% to 5%. So is it correct to assume that there is quite some margin
erosion in the Home segment. And hence, trading environment continues to be diﬃcult
there? Secondly, on Motor. You said pricing is not quite ahead of claims. Can you give a
bit more color of what that means? And also, maybe tell us why in Q3 a further
deterioration happened? I mean, last year, you said benign claims; H1, you said return to
normal; claims inﬂation now at the upper end. So what has really changed in Q3 on claims
inﬂation. And ﬁnally, on the outlook, you say above 15% return on tangible. Are you also
comfortable to reach your LTIP target, which is 17.5% at the lower end?

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Okay. I'm going to take the Motor one and pass the other 2 to Penny. So yes, what's
nudged up in Motor is damage. And what's nudging that up is, frankly, paints and parts
and a trend which we talked about before, which is kind of increasing complexity of cars'
driving parts costs. So it's just slightly nudged up. We didn't quite price that fully in the
quarter. But in the quarter, we still hit our targets, the implication being for that is we were
slightly above our targets going into the quarter. We had a little bit of a buﬀer. And
obviously, we don't comment on future pricing. But our track record and our strategy is to
hit the loss ratios that we need to hit. So we're never worried about. So we don't like to.
But we're always -- we will always trade appropriately. And if that means a volume
consequence, we'll take that consequence. Penny, on the other 2?

A - Penelope Jane James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Yes. Home. And so it remains competitive, very much as we said at half year. So it's slightly
bifurcated market, with lots of people putting price through. But a couple of players there
Page 3 of 13



FINAL

at any point in time not doing so. We have got -- we got claims inﬂation running at 3% to
5% of long-term range. We have priced claims inﬂation. So we're pleased about that.
What we've seen is some risk mix changes, meaning the average premium is only about
1% or so up, which is why you're seeing us up overall of muted amounts, if you like. But
overall, in pretty competitive conditions, we're pleased to have priced claims inﬂation and
pleased we've got a small amount of growth. ROTE, I didn't quite catch the end of the
question. But I think the essence is we're not changing our outlook on ROTE at all. So
that's a normal. And we're comfortable with the targets.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Yes, my point on ROTE was you have a long-term target, which is 15%. But your LTIP as
from this year attached with it is 17.5%.

A - Penelope Jane James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

And my question was, are you also comfortable to hit the lower bandwidth of your LTIP as
much as to 15%?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Yes. I mean, just to step in, I mean, 15% is a hurdle. It's jump -- I mean, it's a very long-term
target. It's something which we use to appraise capital decisions and business decisions.
We've long said that it's -- and of course, the RemCo has to sit -- has to set ROTE targets
that are suitably stretching to the business. And those are set out. So -- but as Penny said,
nothing to look at here. No change in outlook.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Okay. And Home, did I get it right, you are not expecting a margin deterioration? Is that
correct?

A - Penelope Jane James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

That's correct. We've priced claims inﬂation. So the balance is in the risk mix change. So
we're comfortable that the margins are ﬂat to risen slightly up.

Operator
The next question comes from the line of Edward Morris calling from JPMorgan.

Q - Edward Morris

{BIO 16274236 <GO>}

The ﬁrst one is just if we could drill down a little bit more on margins in Motor. So you're
talking about claims inﬂation at the upper end of this 3% to 5% range. I wonder if you can
just talk a little bit more detail around average pricing and how it relates to your average
premium. Because you're mentioning here changes in promotions on PCWs, can you just
Page 4 of 13



Company Name: Direct Line Insurance Group PLC
Company Ticker: DLG LN Equity
Date: 2018-11-06

explain that a little bit? And really, what I'm just trying to get at here is some of your peers
have been a bit more clear on their sort of current margin compression in motor. Can you
just help us to think about the level of proﬁtability of the business you're writing today
versus one year ago?

FINAL

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Okay. So we've priced a bit up. Risk mix has come back the other way. So that's 2 things.
One is as we redo technical price models, it's just a consequence of that is you'll get a
diﬀerent risk mix that you're competitive for. And that's happened to have gone to a lower
risk mix. It could have gone to a higher risk mix. The other thing is it's just kind of our
phasing of promotions on PCWs. So we're anniversary-ing a promotion where we did free
rescue, which tends to appeal to young drivers who've got slightly less reliable cars. And
replaced it with motor legal protection, which tends to appeal to older drivers with lower
risk mix. So that's just a kind of phasing of promotions comment. So none of it is a desire
to have a lower risk mix. With everything else being equal, we'd like probably to have a
higher risk mix. But it's just a consequence of our science and our promotional strategy.
Now what we have said is, just kind of to dive a little bit, is Penny said at the half year, if
you remember, that probably a good reference point would be the immediately preOgden level of proﬁtability we're writing at. So the current year loss ratios we achieved in
the second half of '16. And that's the kind of level which we expect to see in the second
half of '18.

The next question comes from the line of James Shuck calling from Citi.

Q - James Austin Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

I'm James Shuck from Citi. Two questions, please. Firstly, can I just return to your
comments, Paul, about just the market behaving rationally? I mean, if I look at -- I mean,
you posted 0.7% growth sequentially own brands policy count Q3 versus Q2. You say
you've increased rates. Could you just tell me what the risk-adjusted increase in pricing
was in Q3 for yourselves, please? But also just to square that with the market behaving
rationally, because most of the survey that we see, they're still showing quite big declines
year-on-year, I appreciate some of that in new business as opposed to actually achieved
rates. But it looks as if it's getting harder for you to generate growth and put through rate
increase. So if you could just elaborate a little bit on that point for me, that would be
helpful. Secondly, just in terms of a prior year reserves development, could you give us an
insight into how that's evolving in the second half of the year? You did 13.2 points at H1 '18.
So just interested to know how that's developing given some of the trends on the claims
inﬂation that you've mentioned.

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Great. Well thank you, James. So listen, we're not going to disclose exactly the
percentage rates. We do that twice a year now. We think we probably don't want to overdisclose. But could you get some rates away, as we said, it wasn't quite enough. And
therefore, we kind of got back to our target. We're a little bit ahead of it. So we have some
trading room for maneuver, which we used in the quarter. I think we've said that the
Page 5 of 13



FINAL

market rationality comment, if you remember, we did an excellent job at the half year I
thought about saying. When there were very clear input cost changes over the last couple
of years, the markets responded pretty quickly to those changes. That -- so the nature of
claims inﬂation is probably it's like somewhat harder to read because you got to be taking
severity and frequency and underlying weather. And so as I think Penny said last time, it
may well be that the market will maybe lag a little bit. We obviously don't know the
direction of the market. But we're not calling anything out in terms of -- nothing to worry
about the market. And we've reassured to see the market stabilizing, which is a change in
direction as it was at the half year. So we're kind of encouraged by that. Immediately
passed this, as we said, the markets behave rationally. We will, of course, take our own
choices into the market. And we have a very clear sense of the loss ratios that we want to
be writing at. Penny?

A - Penelope Jane James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

PYD? Yes. You may recall at half year, I said we do the bulk of our bodily injury, sort of
large bodily injury reserve reviews in the ﬁrst half. And the second half, generally, there's
less coming through on prior year developments. So in eﬀect, no new news on that, on
PYDs, it's what we said at half year.

Operator
The next question comes from the line of Sami Taipalus calling from Goldman Sachs.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

A couple of questions. First, on Motor IFP growth, you've been -- you've sort of gone
through a period of fairly strong growth there. But am I sort of interpreting your
comments right there that you're perhaps approaching the point where you're coming
after your target loss ratios. And maybe we should moderate our expectations on IFP
growth a bit? Then the second question I wanted to ask was on the FCA and CMA reviews
into pricing practices in Motor and Home insurance. It would just be really interesting to
hear your view about how you see this and what sort of potential risks and outcomes. If
there's anything you can say, that would be great.

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Yes. I mean, I think what we're saying on Motor is really, in terms of the market, to a certain
extent, what our volumes will be because we will price -- we're priced to hit the loss ratios
that we want to hit. And if, yes, the market allows, it will grow. And if the market doesn't,
we won't. So that -- the goal seek is the loss ratio. And the outcome is the -- of our
competitiveness is the volume consequences. So I think we're pretty clear on that. So it's
kind of in a way not down to us. So we'll see. The FCA is a natural next step on that
process. It's -- we've been working with them and the industry over the last few years on
it. I think we've characterized the market working well for most customers but low barriers
to switching, very easy to shop around. And we speak to 80% of our customers each year.
Customer engagement is very high. The customers shopping around is very high. So we
think it's a market that generally works well. But of course, the question is, are there some
customers who probably it would work less well? Obviously, it's a new topic we've been
really on, in this case, for a number of years. Actually, it's encouraging to see that in a CEO
Page 6 of 13



FINAL

Date: 2018-11-06

letter, all the things they set out doing, we're well advance actually on doing all that stuﬀ
ourselves already. So none of that is a surprise. So I think we just have to wait and see
where the market study comes out. We like the fact that it's evidenced-based. It reﬂects
the complexity of the market. And there will be desire to see there are diﬀerent market
models thinking more generally to work the investment in the current one. And we'll wait
and see the outcome of that. Obviously, in -- as long as it's the market that is a level
playing ﬁeld, we'll deploy our assets into that market and see how we do. But it's a
considered, thoughtful process. And we are -- we kind of overall welcome it.

Operator
The next question comes from the line of Andrew Sinclair calling from Bank of America.

Q - Andrew Sinclair

{BIO 17749036 <GO>}

Just a couple left from me. Just on subsidence claims, ﬁrstly, you're saying don't expect it
to be materially above normal expectations. I just wonder if you can give us any more
about how you've managed to keep such claims to manageable levels and whether you
see any material risk of delayed reporting of such claims. Secondly, just on the
competitive motor market, how much temporary eﬀects in the quarter did you see from
competitors preemptively allowing for things like whiplash reform and then backing that
out after delays as opposed to doing it early in Q3?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Yes. Yes. We don't think subsidence -- sorry, we don't think whiplash kind of ﬁgured really
in it because it was all -- the timing of it now since it's going to be delayed, it wasn't within
the 12-month lead-in period. So -- or it's just about the very margins of it. So we don't
think that's a factor. Subsidence or subsidence, we've been debating how to pronounce it
this morning.

A - Penelope Jane James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Yes, subsidence. Look, we've seen a small uptick in the frequency but not as dramatic as
sort of through the vent levels. And we reserve a fair amount we allow for a normal level
of concern in a plenty of way. So we think there'll be a small uptick but not material,
single-digit million.

Operator
The next question comes from the line of Greig Paterson calling from KBW.

Q - Greig N. Paterson

{BIO 6587493 <GO>}

Just have 3 questions, just a catch-up on the other lines.

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Greig, unusually, we can't hear you very well. Could you speak up a bit?

Page 7 of 13

Q - Greig N. Paterson

{BIO 6587493 <GO>}

Can you hear me? So in -- I want to do a catch-up on the other lines. Could you give us a
feel for rates versus inﬂation in your Commercial book, in your Rescue and other personal
lines book and in the Home partners book, please?

FINAL

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Yes. So which should we go ﬁrst with? I mean, I think Rescue is kind of a little bit volatile
because, obviously, weather has an impact. So generally, as cars are getting more (novel)
frequencies going down but severities going up because cars are more complex. So it's a
little bit of the same thing as we see in the garages on damage. But generally, we're
pleased with the proﬁtability of Rescue. And we're particularly pleased with the growth of
Rescue. So everything that we've talked about. I think Commercial, listen, we're extremely
focused on pricing claims inﬂation. You'll see that in the NIG volumes. So we are right ﬁrst
on it, on the NIG book. And we are happy to take, yes, almost a free pass on volumes for
the team because we're -- really, the objective of that business is to get to our target levels
of returns. Then the claim news about DL4B is that it's a very proﬁtable book. These are
very good products. And we're very pleased with that. So we're, again, happy with the
rating environment in Commercial. And we're bearing fruit now in the bps in the DL4B,
very happy. And then we're very, very rational and value focused in NIG. Partners?

A - Penelope Jane James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Home, yes, no, we're pricing inﬂation across the whole book, including partners.

Operator
The next question comes from the line of Jonny Urwin calling from UBS.

Q - Jonathan Peter Phillip Urwin

{BIO 6126952 <GO>}

Just one left for me. So what's the risk the claims inﬂation breaks up above this 3% to 5%
long-term range? And the reason I ask is, obviously, we've seen an uptick in the quarter.
But also just thinking a bit more about the Nordic markets and Norway in particular, where
we're seeing just consistently rising Motor claims inﬂation mainly due to sort of hybrid and
electric cars. But do you think there's a similar risk in the U.K.?

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Yes. I mean, I think, Jonny, the -- I mean, I think as we've long said, probably the risk to the
market is claims deﬂation, right? So as long as it nudges up, it's actually -- it's potentially a
market size increase. And we think claims inﬂation is not unexpected. And you can price
for it. I think we do think overall technology, which, whilst we have some short-term costs
from -- as we talked about in the damage frequency, it should reduce -- and it's a good
thing for the world. It should reduce the number of accidents or severe accidents. That's
the reason we discount autonomous emergency braking. So we do think technology will
win through. And claims will moderate and, at some stage, start to deﬂate. And I think
that's the bigger risk. So -- but the nature of change -- of claims is changing within the mix.
So yes, I mean, as we said before, the more problematic, longer-term trend for the
industry is claims deﬂation, albeit if people have fewer accidents, that's obviously a good
Page 8 of 13



Company Name: Direct Line Insurance Group PLC

Date: 2018-11-06

thing for consumers. And we welcome it and will take some adaption. But it makes our
lives somewhat easier for us, besides claims inﬂation, as long as it's predictable. And as
we said, this is a nut job. This isn't the kind of unpredictable change, Jonny.

FINAL

The next question comes from the line of Dom O'Mahony calling from Exane.

Q - Dominic Alexander O'Mahony
Just a couple of questions from me, if that's all right. Just coming to the Civil Liability Bill,
the whiplash reforms, I appreciate it's quite a diﬃcult question to answer. But would you
expect your competitors to start sort of pricing in and guessing the claims impact of those
reforms ahead of the reforms, i.e. sort of early sometime next year? Or do you expect
them to wait until April 2020 when the reforms are actually in place. And then you can
actually see what sort of impact it has on claims experience? Then just a second question,
related to the comparethemarket.com decision, your preliminary decision yesterday,
clearly, it could be bad news for them. But I wonder whether you think there might be any
potential negative impacts on the insurers themselves. Given that these most favored
nation clauses in the contracts presumably was signed by the insurers, do you think
there's any potential risk that the Competition and Markets Authority looks at the insurer
as well and adjust the PCWs?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Yes. Thanks, Dom. Listen, I mean, as you say rightly, the best case into Compare the
Market. And I can say we're happy with the interim ﬁlings published last week. And that's
probably all I could -- can and should say on that. In terms of Civil Liabilities Bill, I think the
ﬁrst thing to say is that we're all, as insurers, committed. And actually, as we've said
before, the market behaves exactly in this way, that all the beneﬁts will go to customers.
And that's the way the market's behaved. And we've pledged to government to do that.
And we will follow that through. And rationally, what that should mean, if it was
numerically driven, that would be gradual. As you do renewals, it would be a
mathematical relationship to how many months would be applying in the new regime.
Obviously, that's a limit of what I'm going to say on future pricing because, obviously, how
people choose to price is up to them. But as we said before, this is not going to stick to
the sides of insurers. Rightly so, this will go to consumers.

Operator
The next question comes from the line of Andrew Crean calling from Autonomous.

Q - Andrew John Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Just 2 questions. Firstly, is the inﬂation in Motor, at 5%, a function of the fact that
frequency fell rapidly in the Third Quarter '17. And therefore, there's a base eﬀect? And
secondly, you talk about your midterm ambition to maintain 93%, 95%. Could you ﬂesh
that out a bit for us as of now or the full year in terms of what you see in terms of PYD
because I think you go back coming down and how you see that being made up in terms
of current year claims and expense ratios?

FINAL

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Yes. Thanks, Andrew. So yes, listen, let me try and help you on severity versus frequency.
So basically, our 3% to 5% is severity driven because we have kind of observed frequency
being pretty ﬂat. You -- against that, you have kind of better than ﬂat years, which is what
'17 was. And you have worse than ﬂat years, which is what '18 happens. It looks like it's
being driven by too cold and then too hot weather. So what when we say underline, we're
really talking about severity there. Then obviously, you'll get better and worse, depending
on frequency. Hope that's clear.

Q - Andrew John Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

So it's not burn -- you're not talking burn costs, right? You're just talking average claims?

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Yes. Now obviously, we change -- if long term, it look like frequency's going up or going
down, we do not reﬂect that. So for long term, at the moment, reads severity. Penny, on
the PY?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Penelope Jane James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

On the PY, I'll take the feedback on the -- of the year-end reporting on the current year
and prior years, which we've had that conversation, Andrew. And heard you. I think, yes,
the other thing to note is it is also supported by kind of reductions in the expense ratio
and the commission ratio. I think in the short term, that's driven this increase this year and
previous years by commission ratio falls. There is a lot of work going on at the moment to
support the expense ratio reductions. We're investing heavily to get cost volatility out at
the moment. So that probably accelerates over time in terms of expense ratio reductions
rather than all coming through upfront. But I will take your point on the wishing for more
insights as we go.

Operator
(Operator Instructions) The next question comes from the line of James Shuck calling
from Citi.

Q - James Austin Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

I suppose this is partly a request for the full year as well. But if you're able to give any
insight now, that would be helpful. But obviously, a large part of what you're doing is to
drive up the numbers of products that people own. And we haven't really had any update
on that since the IPO. Are you able to shed any insight now in terms of, yes, the
proportion of customers that have a Motor policy that actually own one or more products?
That would be helpful to me. And if it was given now, then certainly, something at the full
year just showing how you're progressing on that would be very helpful. Second question
is just -- or just around the timing of the succession plans around the CEO and when we

Yes. Thanks, James. So my understanding is the process is on track. You're aware of kind
of my year. And I'm sure the board will try and have succession or aware about those
timings, obviously, it's getting the right outcome is more important than a quick one. But
the beneﬁt we have is I'm here fully focused -- hopefully, this comes across today -- and all
over it. But we got a good track record, I think, of hiring well and managing succession
well. So the board's on with that. Obviously, it's not -- it's on a process, though, I must
speak here. But my understanding is it's going to plan. And I'm here for as long as I'm
needed through that year and, as I speak now, fully focused on the business. In terms of
multi-products, as we haven't done a particular update, what I'd probably refer you to is,
as we talked about the new systems, which are on track, built into those is making it much
easier for us to cross-sell to customers. So you know that's always in this kind of CRM
capability and the multi-products capability, things like doing multicar in diﬀerent ways.
So we're pretty good at this thing already. We do it by kind of cross-product discounting
in a relatively simple way. But we get a much more sophisticated tool sets. And I think we
are excellent marketeers. So I think the new tools and that is one of the areas that we think
there should be opportunities in new systems alongside pricing sophistication, alongside
self-service. So that's why we're excited to say that we're on track to bring that in next year
or something around that next year.

But nothing you can share at this moment in terms of the base points sort of starting into
those new systems?

We will take away the request for disclosure on it. Yes. We'll add that to our list of things
you'd like us to say.

The ﬁnal question comes from the line of Greig Paterson calling from KBW.

Q - Greig N. Paterson

{BIO 6587493 <GO>}

I'm sorry, just in terms of the Guidewire, when you said it's coming online next year, I
assume you start with new business and then move on to renewals. When do you think
the process of moving all new business and renewals will be on the new system? Sort of
what's the end date?

A - Paul Robert Geddes

{BIO 2474781 <GO>}

Yes, I mean, it's going to be -- it will take -- it will be done in phases, Greig, to be able to
do it safely. But we're not going to hang around. But it will take a couple of years to get
through all that. We're obviously going to be making sure that we roll out in the schedule
which maximizes our learning and then maximizes beneﬁt realization. So we are -- we
have a very sophisticated plan. And we know exactly how we're going to do it in
subphases and phases. So we're really into the exciting part about this becoming real and
us having quite detailed plans about the phasing of it. And I think what we'll probably do
is tell you as we do it, Greig.

Then before, I mean, because we saw Hastings do a sort of point of inﬂection starting oﬀ
the amortization of the capitalized software development costs. Are you going to do a
sort of immediate start-from dates? Or are you going to phase in the amortization of this -of the CapEx on the system?

A - Penelope Jane James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Sorry, I'm not certain kind of exactly how it is going to get. But we will phase it as an
outcome of how the other value is building and how the rollout is happening, as we
intend to.

Q - Greig N. Paterson

{BIO 6587493 <GO>}

But it's not going to be a cliﬀ edge, it's going to be a slow phase?

A - Penelope Jane James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

I'm not a big fan of cliﬀ edges if I can help it. So -- yes.

Q - Greig N. Paterson

{BIO 6587493 <GO>}

It makes you feel alive, cliﬀ edges.
