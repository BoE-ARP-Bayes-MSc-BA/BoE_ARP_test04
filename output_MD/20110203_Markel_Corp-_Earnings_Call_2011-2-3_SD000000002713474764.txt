Before we get started, we follow the liturgy of reminding you of the Safe Harbor
statement. During our call today, we may make forward-looking statements. Additional
information about factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those
projected in the forward-looking statements is described under the captions Risk Factors
and Safe Harbor and Cautionary Statement in our most recent annual report on form 10-K,
and quarterly report on form 10-Q, and on pages five to seven of our press release dated
February 3, 2011. Our press release, which may be found on our web site at
www.markelcorp.com, also provides a reconciliation to GAAP of certain non-GAAP financial
measures we may discuss in the call today.
With that, I turn it over to Ann.

I will follow the same format as in past quarters. I will focus my comments primarily on
year-to-date results. I will start by discussing our underwriting operations, followed by a
brief discussion of our investment results, and bring the two together with a discussion of
our total results for the 2010 year.
Moving right into the underwriting results, 2010 gross premiums were just under $2 billion,
up 4% compared to 2009. The increase in 2010 was due to higher gross premium volume
in the specialty admitted and London insurance market segments. For the year ended
December 31st, 2010, the specialty admitted segment included $41 million of gross
written premiums from our new FirstComp workers compensation operation. The
increase in gross written premiums in the London insurance market segment was due in
part through our acquisition of Elliott Special Risks in late 2009.
Net written premiums were approximately $1.8 billion, up 3% to the prior year. Retentions
were down slightly in 2010 at 89% compared to 90% in 2009. Earned premiums
decreased 5% primarily due to lower earned premiums in the excess and surplus line
segments, as a result of lower growth premium volume compared to 2009. The decline in
consolidated earned premiums was partially offset by the addition of approximately $37
million of earned premiums from FirstComp.
Our combined ratio was 97% for 2010, compared to 95% in 2009. The increase is due to
a higher current accident year loss ratio and a higher expense ratio, partially offset by
more favorable development of prior years' loss reserves compared to 2009. The
combined ratio for 2010 included approximately $75 million, or 4 points of underwriting
loss, for two programs that were exposed to losses associated with the adverse
conditions in the residential mortgage market in recent years, as compared to
approximately $35 million, or two points of underwriting loss, in 2009. The combined ratio
also included $33 million, or 2 points of underwriting loss, from the Chilean earthquake
and the Deep Water Horizon drilling rig explosion which occurred in February 2010 and
April 2010, respectively.

FINAL

The 2010 current accident year loss ratio was 71%, compared to 68% in 2009. The 2010
current accident year loss ratio includes approximately 3 points of losses on the two
programs I just mentioned, that were impacted by the adverse conditions in the
residential mortgage market in recent years. These same two programs contributed one
point of loss to the 2009 current accident year loss ratio.
Favorable redundancies on prior year loss reserves increased to $278 million, or 16 points
of favorable development, compared to $235 million, or 13 points of favorable
development, in 2009. The increase was primarily due to more favorable development of
prior years' losses in the excess and surplus line segment and the London insurance
market segment. Our 2010 expense ratio increased approximately 1.5 points to 42%. The
increase in the expense ratio is partially the result of lower earned premiums in the
excess and surplus lines segment compared to the same period last year. Costs related
to our Atlas systems initiative represent approximately 3 points on the combined ratio in
2010 compared to 2 points in 2009.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to our investment results, investment income was up 5% in 2010 to $273 million,
primarily due to having higher invested assets and higher dividend income compared to
2009. Net realized investment gains were $36 million compared to net realized
investment losses of $96 million in 2009. Realized gains in 2010 included $12 million of
write-downs for other than temporary declines in the estimated fair value of investments,
compared to $90 million of write-downs in 2009. Unrealized gains increased $244 million
before taxes in 2010, due to increases in fixed income and equities securities. Tom will go
into further details in his comments.
Looking at our total results for 2010, we reported net income to shareholders of $267
million, compared to $202 million in 2009. Book value per share increased 16%, to
approximately $326 per share at December 31, 2010, an all-time high for the Markel
Corporation.
The effective tax rate was 9% in 2010, compared to an ETR benefit of 2% in 2009. In both
years our effective tax rate differs from the statutory tax rate of 35%, primarily as a result
of tax exempt investment income and tax benefits associated with foreign operations. For
the year ended 2010, the effective tax rate includes an 11% income tax benefit related to
foreign operations as a result of a change in our plans regarding the amount of earnings
considered permanently reinvested in foreign subsidiaries.
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, operating cash flow was $223 million in 2010
compared to operating cash flows of 282 million in 2009. In 2009, net cash provided by
operating activities included the receipt of $34 million related to our 2008 federal income
tax refund. Investments in cash held at the holding company were just under $900 million
at December 31st, 2010 as compared to slightly more than $1 billion at the end of 2009.
The decrease is primarily due to the holding company funding the acquisition of Aspen
Holdings, Inc., stock re-purchases and interest payments on debt.
At this point I will turn it over to Mike to further discuss operations.

{BIO 7345383 <GO>}

Thanks, Ann. Good morning. This morning my comments will be brief.

FINAL

I know that all of you are as tired of the soft market as we are. But it's the world we live in
and we will continue to manage our business accordingly.
North American operations performed adequately during the quarter. Clearly, there is
continued room for improvement, and we remain focused on our key objectives as we
enter the new fiscal year. As a reminder, those objectives include continued process
improvement, control and reduction of operating expenses, and pursuit of new business
through intelligent research and persistence, and the attraction of top talent to fill open
positions.

Bloomberg Transcript

In support of these goals during the Fourth Quarter, the E&S segment continued efforts to
leverage the one Markel strategy in several ways; by increasing the commitment to our
corporate account executive program designed to enhance our national relationships, by
centralizing broker assignments, coordinating all interactions for consistency and
establishing strategic plans for each of our national relationships, by introducing a new
product, Markel Priority, as a market alternative for smaller transactional accounts seeking
property, casualty, D&O, or professional liability coverages. This offering includes a
streamlined automated process which has been well received, and we began binding
business on this product in November.
They also launched a formal technology project for an overhaul of our wholesale broker
portal. Phase one should be completed by April. This new broker portal will provide
improvements in context, functionality and ease of use for online transactions with our
wholesale brokers. And they also re-assigned 88 underwriting support professionals in
the role of working directly with regional underwriting staff to improve the speed of our
quote, find and issue times.
Our specialty admitted division was significantly expanded, as you know, with the
completion of the acquisition of Aspen FirstComp in October. FirstComp is a workers'
compensation underwriting company for small, carefully selected risks. We are confident
that the additional management and support talent joining Markel, and the sales and
marketing discipline that they bring to our company, along with their knowledge and use
of metrics, will significantly broaden the growth opportunities for all of Markel specialty.
In addition to the Aspen FirstComp acquisition, we continued our technology and process
improvement initiatives, designed to improve efficiency in our property and casualty
operations. And we launched several new initiatives. Examples include the exclusive new
winery program; an advertising agreement to promote independent insurance with
David's Bridal, which is the largest distributor of wedding gowns in North America; a new
data breach coverage opportunity with one of our carrier alliance partners; and a new
garage admitted dealer product in several states.

FINAL

Also, our product line leadership group, headed by Gerry Albanese, our Executive Vice
President and Senior Underwriting Officer, added new talent in the Fourth Quarter. Glenn
Mangold joined Markel as Product Line Leader and Managing Director of our architects &
engineers, lawyers, and agents & brokers professional liability. Glenn has 24 years
experience and was most recently with CAN.
With the addition of Glenn, over the last 12 to 18 months we have strengthened our
product development and product line management, with new leadership for architects &
engineers, transportation, management liability, D&O, crisis management and property.
All of these leaders are fine-tuning and refreshing our offerings, making them more
attractive and competitive from a coverage standpoint without jeopardizing our
underwriting discipline.
The product line group also launched four new high-profile product lines in the quarter.
I've already mentioned Markel Priority. In addition to Markel Priority, they launched railroad
protective, primary auto and excess auto.

Bloomberg Transcript

We are also pleased to report that Scott Charmineaux [ph] joined Markel last quarter as
Managing Director, Markel Actuarial. Scott has over 25 years actuarial experience in
casualty rate-making and re-insurance, with special expertise in workers' compensation.
Scott reports to Brad Kiscaden, our Chief Actuarial Officer.
The number of new opportunities we have for generating business in both the E&S and
specialty segments is exciting. However, as we all know turning those opportunities into
premium dollars remains the same challenge, due to the soft market, that it has been
throughout 2010, and we expect market conditions to remain soft in 2011.
In summary, we have our heads up, our eyes on the ball. We are realistic about the
hurdles ahead, but we're also very confident that we're positioned for success in 2011.
I'll turn it over to Richie Whitt. Richie?

Richie Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone.
The international operations had a good year despite the difficult operating conditions
that Mike mentioned. Premium volume was up about 11% for the year. This is primarily due
to the 2009 acquisition of Elliott Special Risk that we mentioned previously, and due to
conditions in the marine energy and liability market, opposed to the Deep Water Horizon
loss earlier this year.
International finished the year with a 95 combined, which is a good result considering the
Deep Water Horizon loss, and Chilean earthquake from earlier. 2010 was an extremely
busy catastrophe year on the international front. Our team did a really nice job controlling
their catastrophe exposures, and producing an underwriting profit for the year.

As Mike said, the markets remain competitive and it's certainly no different on the
international side. The January 1 renewals in London were flat to slightly down in most
lines of business. On the positive side, marine, energy and liability continued to see
increases in the 10% to 20% range. However, on the other side, US property cat rates
were down 5% to 10% on average. It appears that underwriters have forgotten that
catastrophes can and will occur in the United States. All of the international underwriting
divisions continue to work extremely hard to grow the business profitably, but it's a tough
market, and we know that our first priority is always going to be underwriting profitability.
Anticipating the questions, we do have exposure to the recent floods in Australia. We
currently estimate that our exposure to the January floods are in the range of $10 million
to $15 million. This remains a developing situation and the numbers could change. Also, as
most of you know, a Category 4 cyclone has hit Australia in the last 24 hours. We obviously
will be assessing our exposure to this event over the coming weeks. Obviously, our best
go to the folks in Australia. They've had a real tough time of it the last couple of months.
Hopefully it will get better soon.
To sum it up, despite difficult market conditions and an incredibly busy catastrophe year,
William Stovin and our international team had another solid year. We are off to a good
start in 2011 and we're optimistic, despite market conditions, that we can continue to grow
our international franchise profitably.

At this point, I will turn it over to Tom to discuss investments and Markel Ventures.

Tom Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Thank you, Richard. Good morning.
In our guiding statement at Markel, known as the Markel Style, there is one sentence that
states our pledge to our shareholders is that we will build the financial value of our
company. In today's Markel, we've strapped on a third engine compared to the previous
two, to power the growth of the financial value of your company.
I am delighted to report to you that all three engines were working in 2010, as you can
see from the 16% growth in the book value per share this year, to its new record high of
$326. We are also optimistic that all three will continue to do so going forward.
The first and main engine is insurance. Ann, Mike and Richie all gave you some data and
some comments that describe what is going on in the insurance engine at Markel these
days, and I won't repeat their remarks. Suffice it to say that insurance markets remain
challenging. But through constant re-tooling and adaptation, geographic expansions,
acquisitions, and creativity, we are doing pretty well in the fundamentals of insurance. We
continue to achieve underwriting profits and that is no small statement in today's world.
The second engine is the investment operation that connects directly to insurance. I'm
pleased to report that we enjoyed a wonderful year in our investment operations. The
total portfolio return in local currencies was 8.1%, or 7.9% after conversion of all results to
Page 6 of 27

FINAL

US dollars. As always, let me remind you that we run a matched book to the best of our
ability, and whatever foreign exchange factor affects our investments is offset by an equal
and opposite effect on our underwriting operations.
In the fixed income department, we earned 5.4% in total return, which essentially matches
the coupon from the portfolio and aggregate. That is exactly what should happen over
time. We work diligently to avoid credit losses and we do not aggressively trade the
portfolio in the negative sum game of trying to be a superior guesser of the future
direction of interest rates or relative credit spreads. We simply look at our liabilities from
the insurance side and match them up against a portfolio of high-quality fixed income
securities.
As always, we temper that match with some common sense, which continues to suggest
to me that rates are headed higher, not lower. As a result, we continue to maintain bond
maturity at a lower level than our insurance bond. That means we accept lower current
income in exchange for protecting our balance sheet against the risk of rising interest
rates and lower bond prices. During the Fourth Quarter and so far in 2011, this strategy of
shorter maturities has helped us, as rates now seem to indeed be rising somewhat from
their recent ultra-low levels.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the equity side, we enjoyed a fantastic year. We were up 20%, as compared to the
return of 15.1% for the S&P 500. More importantly, over longer periods of time, we've
earned 6.2% for the last five years, and 7.6% over the last 10 years, as compared to 2.1%
and 1.1% for the S&P over the same five; and 10-year periods. This is simply massive outperformance.
While it's wonderful to celebrate and enjoy the backwards-looking view of the last five
and 10 years, the key now is what happens next. I think that the evidence suggests our
investment discipline works over time. I remain confident that our current focus on highquality global leaders in our equity portfolio is the right emphasis for our holdings.
Commodities and more trading-oriented strategies may well out-pace us over the next
year or two, but I do not think that chasing those trends is a wise decision for Markel.
At year end, equities represented 54% of our shareholder's equity account, as opposed
to 48% at year-end 2009. That change comes from the steady ongoing investments
made during the year, as well as the delightful appreciation we enjoyed.
The third engine for value creation at Markel now is the Markel Ventures Group. Our other
revenues in 2010 were about $185 million, and this stems largely, but not exclusively, from
the Markel Ventures Group.
We also enjoyed a productive Fourth Quarter with the acquisition of controlling interest in
Retail Data and Diamond Healthcare just before year end.

FINAL

Retail Data, founded and led by Christy and David Cottrell, serves the grocery, general
merchandise, convenience store, and consumer product industries. They collect and
gather pricing, product, and placement data for their customers -- the retailers -- and
enjoy a 20-year record of growth and financial performance.
With the backing and partnership now in place with Markel, the company should be able
to fully develop its international activities and consumer product initiatives. Christy and
David remain with the company.
Diamond Healthcare, founded and led by George White, is a leading provider of
behavioral health services throughout the United States. They work primarily through
hospitals, and currently serve over 85 hospitals across the country. They bring specialized
knowledge and skills to this field and enjoy a 25 year record of success. George and his
leadership team remain with the company just as has been the case at all of the Markel
Ventures companies.

Bloomberg Transcript

The Markel Ventures Group, now includes these two recent additions, as well as the AMF
Bakery equipment group, Parkland Ventures, PSI and Ellicott Dredge. To date, all of these
operations have performed as we have expected at the time of acquisition.
We are not in the business of providing guidance or steering you towards earning
investments. As fellow shareholders though, we want you to have some sense of the
growing size and scope of this group. Currently we expect total revenues in excess of
$250 million at Markel Ventures in 2011, and we expect to convert double-digit
percentages of each dollar to cash. This is now a third engine which works to create value
for Markel shareholders.
We are pleased to be able to report the comprehensive results of 2010 to you, and we
now look forward to answering your questions. Operator, if you would be so kind as to
open the floor for questions.

Hello, Beth.

FINAL

Q - Beth Malone

{BIO 1497932 <GO>}

I have a couple of questions. Could you, please, explain a little bit more about the tax
credit? And does it indicate that you recorded in the Fourth Quarter? And, does that
suggest that there's going to be a different tax rate in 2011 than what we saw in the first
three quarters of 2010?

A - Richie Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Beth, it's Richie. How are you doing?

Q - Beth Malone

{BIO 1497932 <GO>}

Good.

A - Richie Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Typically, the biggest difference between the 35% rate for us and what we end up
reporting, is municipal securities. For the last two years, that's not been the case, because
we've had, sort of, two foreign tax-oriented items go through. Last year, the UK
government made some tax changes to their regime that produced a benefit for us, and
we recorded that last year. So, we got the benefit for the full year.
This year, in the Fourth Quarter, we made the assessment that we would not have to -we would not be repatriating, or bringing back capital to the US that we earned in our
foreign operations, and what we had been doing for the last couple of years, obviously,
establishing a tax liability on those earnings for US tax. When we looked at things this year,
and the opportunities we have to re-invest in foreign operations, as well as some
restructuring -- legal restructuring we did of our foreign operations -- we no longer
believe we'll be bringing those earnings back. And, as a result, we no longer needed that
tax liability on our books.
So, that was recorded in the Fourth Quarter. And for the last two years, as I said, we've
had two slightly different foreign tax issues that affected the tax rate. Going into 2011, all
things being equal, we would expect the primary driver of our tax rate, difference
between what it is, and 35%, to be municipal bonds. And, so we would expect today to
be in the low 20's in terms of an effective tax rate for 2011.

Q - Beth Malone

{BIO 1497932 <GO>}

Okay. Great. Thank you. And, speaking of municipal bonds, Tom. Could you -- what is your
-- there's a lot of controversy surrounding the municipal bond market. What is Markel's
position? Are you going to de-emphasize muni bonds due to the concerns about the
credit quality, or what?

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

Well, let me walk you through the steps of how we would think about the municipal bond
portfolio. So, in rough order of magnitude, we would expect to have about half of the
fixed income portfolio in munis. So, in rough, rough terms, that's $3 billion, and that's
roughly the same as what the shareholders' equity account is. The first thing we would do
is, we would have the highest quality, and be at the top of the food chain in terms of what
we own in that portfolio. So, we're GOs, and essential products and services. That's step
number one.
Step number two is we would have a 10% rule that we would not have any more than 10%
in any one state. So, for instance, California, or Illinois, New York, or whatever story you
want to talk about, remember that there would be a 10% limit of that $3 billion, or $300
million, that would be exposed to any one of those states. Within each of those states,
we don't buy one bond for $300 million that says "California" on it. We buy some bonds
that say "LAX Airport," and some that say "City of Los Angeles," or some that say "City of
San Francisco," and some that say "GO of the state of California." So, that further
disburses and spreads the risk, and is a prudent way of managing things.
And, then the last and final point, if you want to imagine nightmare scenarios, my personal
belief is that, if there were a severe problem in one of those entities, you would not be
looking at a zero. You would be looking at a restructuring. So, if it was a 5% bond that was
due in 10 years, my guess is those would be restructured and become 3% bonds due in
15 years, or something like that. So, it's a very high cents-on-the-dollar recovery or markto-market. And, net, net, net, net, net -- I think that municipalities and states, while they all
face the crisis that you read about in the headlines. Also, there is a growing sense of
reality within the world of government that they have to live within the means that they
have, the credit markets.
In so many ways, we are kind of back to "That '70s Show" in a lot of dimensions. And, one
phrase from that era was the bond vigilantes. The bond vigilantes are restless, and
they're looking at municipal credit, and they're enforcing market discipline. So, between
that and the specific concrete risk management steps that we have, I'm comfortable with
the exposure that we have.

Q - Beth Malone

{BIO 1497932 <GO>}

Okay, thank you. And, one last question for Mike. You mentioned that you've added some
talent to your -- to the operations, as well as expanded into new markets. How do you -- it
seems difficult to contrast that with the obvious pricing pressure that is taking place in all
the markets?

A - Michael Crowley

{BIO 7345383 <GO>}

Well, Beth, almost all of that talent that I mentioned were filling open positions and
replacements. For example, Glenn Mangold, who I mentioned on the call, replaced Mark
Henderson, who retired earlier in the year. So, we are absolutely being disciplined with
regards to our head count. We -- I think I've mentioned before we have an organized
process where Richie and Pam Perrott, our head of HR, and I get together on a monthly
basis to look at all open positions, look at all requests for hire, and we are not expanding

Page 10 of 27



Company N ame: M arkel Corp

our head count. A lot of these are replacements, upgrades or changes in talent, filling
those positions.

FINAL

A - Richie Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

And, Beth, I want to add to Mike's comment, one of the good things about going through
a soft market or a tough time, is there's a lot of talent around. And, this is a people
business. And, the great thing about the last couple of years is that we have, because of
our consistent performance and long-term record and culture of Markel -- really been a
bright shining light that has attracted a lot of people. So, there are a lot of people that
would like to be part of Markel, and more so than would be the case in a normal
environment. And, we're trying to take advantage of that and make sure that we have the
best possible team on the field.

A - Tom Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

A couple of people are new but when we look at these situations where we have an
opportunity to bring a particular expertise or team on board, you can be assured there is
a number attached to that, and we're doing some pro formas long before we agree to
do it.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Beth Malone

{BIO 1497932 <GO>}

Okay, and just one clarification. So, where you are adding people or expanding margins, I
guess, in order for you to maintain the conservatism you've already demonstrated in the
past, that means you're -- are people sitting idle because you're not going to write
business in this particular market? Or, are you entering markets where you do believe you
can price the product profitably?

A - Tom Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

We are entering markets where we believe we can price the product profitably. And, keep
in mind that all of these people -- Gerry Albanese has been with the company a long time,
who is our Senior Underwriting Officer, oversees all of this, and he's the key player in
making the decisions on whether this talent comes on board or not. We do not have
people sitting idle. Our submission counts that we mentioned in the Third Quarter, as well,
are up. So, people are busy. The challenge we have is converting those submissions into
premium dollars in this marketplace.

Thanks and good morning. Just going back to your comments on Australia. Can you just
expand on that a bit more? Is that property or is that business interruption? What sort of
losses should we expect?

FINAL

A - Richie Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

It's going to be primarily property. I mean, and, we don't -- I mean, we certainly write in
Australia. We're not a huge writer in Australia. So, you've seen some releases out there,
people putting out estimates of their numbers. We're not going to see numbers like
some of those. But, clearly we do write in Australia. We have an open market property
book and, so, we'll pick up some losses there. We also write some treaty property reinsurance so we will pick up some losses there.
But, at the same time, for example, the national flood program, we don't write that. A lot
of people obviously are picking up some losses on that program. We're not on that. So,
certainly we're going to have losses but we don't see it as a huge mover for our First
Quarter results.

Q - Amit Kumar

And, did Q4 have any impact or no?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Richie Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Small, certainly, yes. The flooding, as you know, started before the end of the year. So, we
did have some losses come in as a result of the flooding that occurred before the end of
the year, but it was fairly immaterial.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Got it. And can you sort of expand on that discussion a bit? There's been a lot of chatter
about exposure to Middle East and Egypt. And, can you remind us if you write any political
risk and covers of those type, and would you have any exposure?

A - Richie Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

We do write some war exposure. That tends to finds its way into London into the marine
market. So, we could pick up some exposure in that account. But, we're not -- I'll just say
at this point we're not aware of anything. But, it is possible. We don't expect anything
significant from it. But, certainly, it is possible.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Got it. Just moving on, quickly -- on to the reserve releases. I was a bit surprised by the
level of releases, and I go back to your discussion on London market segment. And,
previously you had talked about releases coming from 2004 to 2008 accident years. I'm
wondering if this quarter's releases were also from the same time frame? And, then,
maybe can you remind us what are the carriage reserves for this book, as a percentage
of your, I guess it's $5.4 billion total reserves.

A - Tom Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Well, in terms of the years involved, certainly 2004 through 2008, there were releases in
that area. In addition, we had some releases from years prior to that. We had some
releases in the 2002 and prior areas of the book. And, one thing I might say, and I think if
you were to go back and look at our results over the years, we do, obviously, our hardest
-- we have an IBNR review every quarter. But, we obviously do the most work leading up
to our year-end results. And, just as a result of that, and the conservatism that we
exercise, in the first couple of quarters we tend to be very conservative, and, as the
picture for the year develops throughout the year, the third and Fourth Quarter tend to be
a little bit heavier in terms of releases.
And, I think this year was similar to last year in terms of the theme, but maybe a little more
released as just a result of things we saw. About -- Markel international is about 40% of
our loss reserves, so that gives you an idea of the magnitude. But, that's sort of a theme,
and did have some releases from earlier accident years. The 2002 and prior buckets,
where we went back and we did some reviews of those reserves, and realized that we
had some redundancy there that needed to flow through the P&L.

Got it, that's very helpful. And, just final question on Aspen. Previously, we talked about
Aspen's business plan for 2011 and there had been some discussion on retaining $140
million out of $300 million. Can you just sort of refresh us where you stand on the thought
process, and how we should think about this going forward? Thanks.

A - Tom Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Well, in terms of 2011, our best estimate right now is that we would be retaining roughly
$200 million of FirstComp's business this year. That's highly subject to change, because
the workers' comp market is -- as competitive as the overall property casualty market is -the workers' comp market is even more competitive. And, we've talked about it, I don't
know how many times. It's going to be underwriting profit first, and that is exactly the
philosophy at FirstComp, as well.
So, those guys -- they're going to be very careful given where the workers' comp market
is today. But, we think we could retain probably around $200 million this year of that
business, all -- if everything happens as we expect. It's probably also worth pointing out,
this is a year of transition for FirstComp. Obviously, they've had a hybrid MGA and riskbearing model in the past, and we going to be moving to primarily a risk-bearing model.
So, we've got that change occurring this year. Also, our conservatism in loss reserves,
something we've been very proud of over time at Markel, we're moving them, obviously,
to our reserving philosophy.
As a result of that, it's -- we expect that FirstComp will be at an underwriting loss for 2011,
as we work through these things. That underwriting loss, just to give you a sense of it, that
could be on the order of $30 million for 2011, as we work through the transition process.
And, I'll just tell you that is not a surprise to anyone. That's been on the table as an
expectation since we did the acquisition.

Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Hughes of SunTrust. Please state your
question.

Q - Mark Hughes

{BIO 1506147 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning. Any comments you'd care to make on where the reserves
stand today? There's some discussion of a lot of the favorable release trends having kind
of run their course in 2011 -- there's not as much quite lined up -- I'm sorry, in 2010, not as
much lined up for 2011. Any comments you'd care to make on that?

A - Richie Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Mark, I guess what I'd say there is clearly the peak of the market was 2006 or 2007,
depending on the line of business. And, so, the pricing just has not been as strong for the
past several years. We always attempt to establish a consistent and conservative margin
of safety in the reserves. And, I guess the one -- the way I would answer that is to tell you
that at the end of 2010, we believe the margin of safety in our loss reserves is consistent
with 2009. So, we believe it is roughly similar.
How that will come through earnings in the future will completely depend on how those
most recent accident years behave, and, given that pricing was moving, and given that
the market was moving, we just don't know. But, in terms of the balance sheet, and that's
what we think about here at Markel, there was a consistent margin of safety in our minds
at the end of December, 2010 to 2009.

A - Tom Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

I want to add to Richie's comment where he emphasized the balance sheet. Because,
whether it gets recognized in income this year or not, those dollars are on the balance
sheet, and in the investment portfolio the whole time, and generating investment income.
And, it can't be emphasized enough how much of a balance sheet orientation we have.
Every financial company earnings report is a wrestling match between the income
statement and the balance sheet. And, the balance sheet is undefeated in those
wrestling matches at Markel.

Q - Mark Hughes

Any more -- thank you for that. Any more granularity you can provide in terms of pricing, or

This is Mike. No new nuances. I mean we see things are still soft, they're still very
competitive. And, looking out in 2011, we expect more of the same. Hopefully, economic
activity will continue to pick up some. And, that would have an effect. But, we can't
quantify that sitting here today. We're watching our expenses and watching the way we
run the business, keeping in mind that 2011 will look like 2010 with regards to rates and
exposure base.

Q - Mark Hughes

Obviously, rates are starting to move up. Where do you see it now versus three months

Hi. Good morning.

A - Tom Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Hello, Doug.

Q - Doug Mewhirter

{BIO 7026139 <GO>}

Most of my questions have been answered, I guess. The first question would probably be
posed to Tom. I realize that you are definitely much more of a bottom-up investor and
you definitely don't do a lot of top-down asset allocation. But, given where your
opportunities are at, regardless of the opportunities you may see with Markel Ventures,
because they are more opportunistic, where are you sort of shading your new money,
new cash flow, these days?

A - Tom Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Well, fortunately it's pretty much in the same place it's been the last couple of years -- is
the list of what you would call just blue chips, the brand names that you would recognize,
not only in the US, but increasingly every single place around the world. While we had a
really good year, it's almost -- that year was almost too good. And, it surprises me a little
Page 15 of 27

bit. Because last year, coming out of 2008, the risk on, and riskier assets, are the things
that have sprinted ahead the most. And, if you look at some of the smaller indices, the
Russell 3000 or something compared to the S&P 500, the smaller, let's say, for purposes
of argument, more riskier asset classes are moving ahead faster.
We had a good year while remaining very high quality. And, as I think about sort of what
might we be talking about a year from now, I would not be surprised, again, given what
we're talking about inflation, if sort of commodity-oriented things might sprint ahead of us
this year. But, we're not sprinters, we're marathoners. And, as long as I can put new
money in the same sorts of companies that we've been doing for the last couple of
years, where I've got the best franchises in the world at reasonable prices, that's where
the bulk of the money goes.

Q - Doug Mewhirter

{BIO 7026139 <GO>}

Thanks, that's helpful. My second and last question is maybe for Michael or perhaps
Richie. We've heard a lot of pretty down-beat commentary on workers' comp. And, I
realize that when you went to buy Aspen, you had a much longer time frame in mind. But,
does Aspen have -- does its book have any particular characteristics that may -- that was
attractive to you because it may not be, to use a delicate term -- hammered -- by the
current conditions as much, where the maybe the loss costs aren't -- inflation isn't quite as
bad, or you have a better way of controlling frequency, or medical costs, or something like
that?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Michael Crowley

{BIO 7345383 <GO>}

I tell you, the best way I can answer that, there were -- this is Mike. There were two things
that were really -- actually several things that were really attractive to us about Aspen.
Along the lines of your question, one of the things that has impressed us is their
knowledge of their business and their use of metrics and their analysis of the business.
And, as luck would have it, they actually are having a strategic planning meeting here in
Richmond as we sit. And, I went out and attended that meeting yesterday and came away
even more impressed with their knowledge of the business.
Clearly, that doesn't take away from the risk. It doesn't take away from the challenges.
But, their management team knows that business. They stick to their knitting. They don't
do things that they don't understand. And, the other thing -- another thing that was
attractive to us -- was the opportunity, as we've discussed before, to cross-sell our
products to their customers, and their product to some of our customers, and we are
actively working on that strategy right now, and identifying how we're going to go about it.
But, we think there is an up-side opportunity there.
And, lastly, we are more impressed today with their management and their leadership.
They've got a terrific leadership team. So, with their experience in the business, their use
of metrics that is very impressive, and the cross sale opportunities, we feel as good about
that acquisition today as we did when we first looked at it -- actually better. The market -the workers' comp market is tough. But, we think we've got a team here that really
understands, that sticks to their knitting on the small accounts and the small towns, and,
over time, they will perform well for us.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Meyer Shields of Stifel Nicolaus. Please

Q - Meyer Shields

Thanks. Good morning, everyone.

A - Tom Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Hello, Meyer

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

I guess, let me start with Richie. Do you think -- can you contrast the amount of the
reserve development this year that was from settling claims at lower than reserve
amounts to just actual actuarial adjustments?

A - Richie Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Settling claims versus actuarial adjustments? And, I want to make sure I understand that
question. I mean, how do you differentiate from the two?

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Well, in one case, you have liabilities. You just have a more optimistic expectation for what
you're going to pay.

A - Richie Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Right.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

In the other case, you've actually paid it, so the claim is closed.

A - Richie Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Yes. Well, let me try it this way. I wouldn't say that things are settling faster or that we
settled out any sort of enormous claims in the Fourth Quarter, or in the Third Quarter,
where we were -- there was a big range around it in terms of volatility, and so we were
holding a lot of IBNR. I think, quite honestly, it was just; really just more of the same.
But, probably the addition was, as I said in a previous answer, we did release some in the
2002 and prior sort of bucket, if you will, at Markel international, where we probably
haven't looked at those years in a while. We've just -- not, not looked at them, but
Page 17 of 27



Company N ame: M arkel Corp
Company Ticker: M K L US Equity
Date: 2011-02-03

probably not as hard, because we just sort of have been letting them sit there. And, it was
clear there was redundancies in that bucket. And, so we made releases there. But, there
was -- really, nothing stood out as unusual in terms of -- did a big claim settle, anything like
that. It was a very consistent process to what we have done in the past. Nothing unusual.

FINAL

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay, that's very helpful. When you look at accident year 2010, did your expectations for
that change at all over the course of the year?

A - Richie Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

I don't think so. The one thing I will say, the expense ratio in the Fourth Quarter, it was up a
good bit. And, I think you've got to be a little careful about that expense ratio because,
obviously, we had some nice redundancies from prior accident years throughout 2010.
And, when that happens, obviously, we increase bonus accruals related to those prior
accident years.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, we've got the loss reserve coming down as a result of prior accident years. We've got
our current year expense ratio going up because we're putting up additional bonus
accrual on for those prior accident years. So, in the Fourth Quarter, I don't know what the
numbers would be. But, if you looked at the accident year combined ratio, it would look
high. And, part of that is because the expense ratio is getting hit for prior accident years
developing favorably and the bonus accruals we're putting up.
But, I think in terms of 2010 we know the pricing is thinner because we've had to -- as hard
as we held on to it, we've had to give up some price over the past few years. So we know
it's not going to be as -- it's not going to be as good as 2009, it's not going to be as
good as 2008, but, at this point, no surprises in terms of what it looks like.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. That's quite thorough. One quick question for Mike, if I can. Obviously, the
continuing rate competition that we're seeing now does not involve decreases that were
as big as they were, let's say, two or three years ago. Should that pattern continue where
we get smaller and smaller decreases into modest increases just because of back
momentum? Is that the hard market we should be anticipating whenever?

A - Michael Crowley

{BIO 7345383 <GO>}

That's a hard one to answer, Meyer. But, no, I don't think you can model that the
decreases will get smaller, smaller, smaller and then start climbing a little bit, and then get
larger, and larger, and larger. I don't think -- that's just not the way the business works.
I think -- everything that I've seen and everything that I've read, and it's hard to predict,
but I think what we will see in 2011 -- a market that is similar to what we saw in the third
and Fourth Quarter of 2010. The decreases weren't as bad as they were further back, but
they were still decreases. And, so I think -- I would simply look at the Third Quarter and the
Fourth Quarter, and look at 2011 as more of the same.

Q - Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

That would be great. That would be helpful, thank you. And, then, also, in the quarter, I'm
looking at sort of the other revenues, minus the other expenses, presumably that's the
ventures business. And, it looked like the income, the net of those two, was down quite a
bit. Can you talk about why that might have been? And, maybe -- correct me if I'm wrong,
but I thought that was mostly the ventures business?

A - Richie Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

In terms of revenue, Jay, yes. In terms of the net income right now, no. And, that is
because of the Aspen MGA business. And, as we said, 2011 is going to be sort of a -- well,
they came on board October 15th, obviously on board for all of 2011, but we are booking
a loss right now on the Aspen MGA business, both in the quarter and probably for the full
year of 2011. That is because that MGA business is set up with a base commission, and
then a contingent commission based on profitability. Right now, to be conservative, we
are booking loss reserves that would result in no contingent commission being paid on
that MGA business, and thus we're recording it at a loss.

Q - Jay Cohen

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay, thank you. I was just wondering, these really severe storms we've been experience
in 2011 already, do you anticipate that they could have an impact on your losses for the
First Quarter?

A - Richie Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Sure, Beth. I mean, obviously, you'll -- with the amount of snow and things, roof collapses,
you name it -- we will, of course, have exposure to that. And, typically when you have a
bad winter, a stormy winter, our property results aren't that hot at the end of the First
Quarter. So, just given what we have been seeing across the US, I would expect our
property numbers won't look too terrific at the end of the First Quarter. But, often, that
doesn't necessarily mean we end up with a bad property year. You can go the rest of the
year and have a pretty nice year. So, it would not surprise me at all if we start out with a
tough property year.

Q - Beth Malone

Do you think, with that in mind, is that going to have any effect, do you believe, on the

Yes, from a book value point of view, the traditional two main engines of insurance and

that nature. So, almost -- I can't think of any change that would happen in the book value

A - Richie Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Dave, it's Richie. We currently -- we've got two things going on. And, we're probably going
to be moving away from the Atlas initiative. We're getting to the point, probably after
2011, where it's really just run-rate investment and technology to run our business. So, the
Atlas initiative really probably winds down in 2011.
We still have going, as a result of that, our data warehouse initiative, and Mike mentioned
some of the initiatives around our broker web sites, and, so forth, and make business
easier for them to do with us. And, we would expect something on the order of probably
fairly similar to what we had this year, a little bit less than what we had this year. So, I think
it was roughly three points on our combined ratio this year. It's probably going to be less

Q - Ken Billingsley

{BIO 6971717 <GO>}

Good morning. I wanted to follow-up with some commentary that you had on -- I think you
talked about rates and reserves and how the implications maybe were in the past going
forward. But, on the rate side, could you just talk about maybe a new versus renewal rate,
what you're seeing, and also what you're doing, from termed and condition to
deductibles, what competition you're seeing there on the ones that you're winning, and
the business that you're not winning?

A - Michael Crowley

{BIO 7345383 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Probably the best way I could answer that is that -- two things. One, we're not out buying
business. We look at new business with the same jaundiced eye, if you will, that we do
renewal business, and use the experience that we have on lines of business that we write
on renewal, when we look at new business opportunities. So, I don't see a big difference.
I will tell you that other carriers are very aggressive in the new business arena right now
and that's certainly a challenge for us. From a pure rate standpoint, again, I just have to -it's hard to say, but I still look at 2011 like I look at 2010. What was the other part of your
question?

Q - Ken Billingsley

{BIO 6971717 <GO>}

Just, on that, I guess my -- the question on that, on the new versus renewable, are you
having more success with holding rate on renewal business? I'm going off of commentary
that we're hearing from some surveys that have been out recently.

A - Michael Crowley

{BIO 7345383 <GO>}

I might say that, it's easier -- we've done better from a percentage basis of retaining
business than writing new business. It's challenging to write new accounts. It's a feeding
frenzy in a lot of the things that we do.
With regards to deductibles and coverage, as I said earlier, a lot of our product line
leaders are looking at our coverage forms. We did a deep analysis on a lot of casualty
forms last year. We're refreshing those forms, but the enhancements we're making on
them and the improvements are still with a strong eye on underwriting profit. We're not
going to jeopardize our underwriting profit. But, we do refresh forms and look at those on
a regular basis.

And, so -- and then from a shopping standpoint, are you feeling like you are being
shopped, your business is being shopped a little bit less than, maybe, it was back in
2009?

FINAL

A - Michael Crowley

{BIO 7345383 <GO>}

I don't know that I can answer that accurately. I mean, our business gets shopped. I don't
know that it's any more now than it was in the past or any less.

Q - Ken Billingsley

{BIO 6971717 <GO>}

Very good, thank you.

Q - Charles Gold

{BIO 17653874 <GO>}

Congratulations lady and gentlemen on the quarter. The question's about the investment
income line. It looks like that had a nice bump up in the quarter and was the highest of the
year, if I'm correct on that. Obviously, some of that can be attributed to dividend increases
and increased size of investments. But, I wonder whether the municipal problem we're
going through now could also be a blessing and whether, now, some of that money is
rolling over at a higher yield rate than the money it's replacing? In other words, your rollover rate now positive instead of a negative?

A - Richie Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Yes, Charles, I think you have correctly answered your own question. That's correct. And,
the other thing, I would refer back to the earlier comments about where the money is
going, and those global blue chip companies. 2010 was a pretty nice year of dividend
increases.

Q - Charles Gold

{BIO 17653874 <GO>}

Right.

A - Richie Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

So, in many cases, those were yielding just as much as an alternative bond solution. And, I
have one friend who refers to sort of that set of companies as almost corporate tips. You
get an inflation adjusted yield because of the pass-through nature of the company, and
their ability to raise prices and be doing well enough that shows up as pure cash, which
they're in turn using to pay dividends and buy back stock.

My other question, Jay alluded to, which was, the number of the other line where the
revenue and the expenses were the same, and I think the answer had to do with Aspen's
expenses, being on the expense side. If you take that out, were the margins roughly the
same as the first three quarters for the other income and expenses?

FINAL

A - Richie Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

I think roughly so. And, yes, in terms of the -- looking at a real businessman's look at the
businesses we own, that's exactly what is happening. There's distortions in purchase of
accounting, especially in the amortization line when you buy something, and you create an
amortization expense that obscure it a bit in the financial presentation. But, if you were a
businessman, and you were looking at these businesses, they are performing as
expected.

Q - Charles Gold

Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from Meyer Shields of Stifel Nicolaus. Please
state your question.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Thanks. I apologize, this is a question because of my ignorance. What's the tax rate on the
international underwriting profits. If the -- pardon me, if the profits aren't going to be
repatriated?

A - Anne Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

If they're not going to be repatriated, we aren't providing taxes for them. But, if your
question is what is the statutory rate in the UK, it's about 28%.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay, I guess what I'm asking is whether we should apply a different tax rate to the
underwriting profits of the London book?

A - Anne Waleski

{BIO 16735457 <GO>}

It would be -- it would still be in those low 20's if you're doing it on an effective rate.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Yes.

Because they also have tax exempt.

FINAL

A - Richie Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

They are -- I think it would probably be safer than try to put it -- break it into its pieces. I
think it would be safer to tell you that we would expect a low 20s sort of tax rate next
year, as long as we don't have some other change in the tax code or other things going
on.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay, thank you.

Thank you. Our last question is a follow-up from Amit Kumar from Macquarie. Please state
your question.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks. Just very quickly going back to the point you made on Aspen and the $30 million
underwriting loss expected for 2011. I assume that is for the current loss picks for their
business. But, when you looked at Aspen's loss reserves, was there any adverse reserve
adjustment in Q4 results relating to Aspen, and how do you feel about their loss results
going forward?

A - Richie Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Well, I'll say going forward, we feel good about what we're setting reserves up at, and we
feel good about the reserves on the balance sheet today. During purchase or at
purchase, there was an adjustment made to Aspen's loss reserves. It did not go through
Fourth Quarter -- or, our Fourth Quarter earnings -- but there was an adjustment made to
loss reserves to sort of bring them in line with our reserve and standards. So, I can say
that we feel good about the reserves, and we believe they're at a consistent level with
the rest of the company.
But, two things -- workers' comp is relatively new to us; and two, workers comp is
incredibly volatile and a tough market right now. So, I couldn't tell you I have the same
confidence that I have with the reserves that have been on our books for 10 years, and
some of the other lines of business that we've been writing for 10 and 20 years. I just;
we're not there yet.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Thanks. I'm just trying to get some comfort -- and we've seen workers' comp trends
develop in a meaningfully adverse for some other companies over 2010. And, I'm just
wondering, you are retaining $200 million out of $300 million book. Why is that -- if it's

Page 25 of 27

being re-underwritten, I would have expected the number to go down, not up. Maybe,
can you just refresh me on that?

FINAL

A - Richie Whitt

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Yes. Well, now, the $200 million that we're retaining, the book has gone down. I think
Aspen -- or FirstComp -- at their peak, wrote almost $400 million of premium. And, they
finished last year at around $300 million, and we're actually projecting that they write
something a bit south of that for 2011. And, we are increasing our participation on that, our
retention of that business, and we're going to be keeping, we think today, $200 million.
Now, they have taken price increases in some of their states, particularly California. And, if
those price increases result in less business, we'll be keeping less than $200 million. And,
we're perfectly comfortable with that, because the key is to get the price right and write
business to an underwriting profit.
So, I'm not -- while certainly there is the potential for adverse development, I'm not
particularly concerned about the loss reserves that were on the balance sheet when we
bought it, after the reserve adjustment there. Clearly, even though we're taking price
increases, we don't -- the market is volatile. And, we don't know where that's going to
end up yet.
