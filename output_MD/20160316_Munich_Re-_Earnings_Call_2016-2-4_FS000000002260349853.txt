MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Christian Becker-Hussong

{BIO 19080254 <GO>}

Thanks for joining us. Today's call is, as announced, on the Results of the 2016 1st of
January Renewals and our Preliminary Figures for 2015. Set up is as follows. We will start
with an introduction of our CFO, Jörg Schneider and then go right into Q&A.
And with that, I hand it over to Jörg.

Jörg Schneider
Thank you, Christian. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. We met our guidance for 2015
in full and clearly beat our original target with a net profit of around €3.1 billion. This good
result demonstrates our robust reinsurance earnings, supported by our strong balance
sheet. It translates to an ROE of 10% and a RORAC of 11.5%. This is quite pleasing given
the challenging reinsurance market conditions, low interest rates and capital market
volatility.

FINAL

In an increasingly uncertain economic environment, Munich Re continues to deliver
financial stability and reliable earnings. The Q4 result of more than €700 million was quite
decent, but requires further explanation as they were again counterbalancing one-off
effects. As already indicated in early November and as a consequence of the prevailing
low interest rates, we made a goodwill impairment in ERGO's life and health segment,
with a negative impact of €429 million. On the other hand, Q4 earnings benefited from a
positive FX result.
Our capitalization remains very strong according to all metrics and our healthy balance
sheet continues to provide the basis for quite resilient returns and further high payouts.
Pending remaining methodology uncertainties, mainly in calculating owned funds, the
economic solvency ratio, according to Solvency II standards, should have increased
compared to the end of September and even versus yearend 2014.
In German GAAP accounting, the low yield effect is reflected in a book value write-down
of €1.1 billion in the parent company's holding in ERGO. This impact on earnings under
German GAAP is more than compensated by a strong underwriting results and positive
tax effects.

Bloomberg Transcript

Even after further strengthening of the equalization reserve, we achieved a German
GAAP result of €2.6 billion. Since this is higher than dividends and share buybacks in 2015,
we increased our distributable revenues over the course of the year.
Let me now give you the highlights by business segment. Please bear with me that I will
have to stay on a rather general level. The numbers are preliminary and have not been
fully audited yet. I do not expect any major changes but wish to respect the ordinary
procedures.
Let us start with life reinsurance. The technical result of around €90 million in Q4 is more
or less in line with the average quarterly run rate. As indicated earlier, the technical result
for the full year fell short of our €400 million ambition due to two large single claims in the
third quarter and the fourth quarter. These random effects do not concern us as they are
part of normal earnings volatility. The underlying profitability of the business remains
sound and all major markets performed in line with expectations.
I will now move on to P&C reinsurance. The combined ratio was a very good 78.6% for the
fourth quarter. This was partly down to good luck due to low major loss activity and it was
supported by reserves from prior years doing even better than expected with releases
accounting to 16.5%, net of commissions, in Q4.
For the full year, basic loss reserve releases, adjusted for commissions again, were 7.2%
of net earned premiums; once more above our 4% guidance. It is important to note that
we did not sacrifice the reserve strengths on the P&C book and remain at the high end of
the range of best estimates.

FINAL

On a normalized basis, however, the combined ratio has continued to increase over the
course of the year, amounting to slightly above 98.5%. Price reductions experienced in the
renewals were mitigated by positive FX and business mix effects. In the current soft
market, we have not given up on our underwriting discipline. Our initial estimates still
seem to be quite conservative.
During the renewals of our reinsurance treaties at January 1, 2016, the market
environment was almost unchanged compared with 2015. There was sufficient capacity in
all classes of business. Prices remained under pressure, but to a lesser degree than in
previous years. Terms and conditions were largely unchanged, as was the demand for
reinsurance cover. We were able to limit the decrease in prices for our portfolio to just 1%.
As we took advantage of attractive business opportunities resulting from our preferential
client access and leading risk know-how, we even posted a slight increase in premium
volume after adjustment for FX movements. The projected profitability of our portfolio is
still comfortably above our cost of capital.
ERGO posted a disappointing net loss for the full-year 2015, mainly due to the goodwill
write-down and the disposal loss for the Italian units. Positive earnings in German non-life
business only partially offset losses in life and health and in international operations.

Bloomberg Transcript

In Q4, the combined ratio of 103.9% in Germany was largely due to nat cat losses and a
strengthening of the comfort level of claims reserves in liability business. Adjusted for
above-average large claims and the reserving impact I mentioned, the full-year combined
ratio comes a lot closer to our 93% guidance.
The Q4 combined ratio of our international non-life operations amounted to 115.3% and
suffered from a deterioration in Poland, reserve increases in Turkey, and in UK legal
protection business. The combined ratio for 2015 as a whole increased to almost 105%,
clearly above our guidance at the beginning of the year. Furthermore, the sale of ERGO's
Italian business contributed around minus €80 million to the segment's negative Q4
result.
The need for action is obvious. My colleague, Markus Rieß, ERGO's new CEO, is due to
present his program for generating a sustainable earnings improvement during the
second quarter.
Owing to a somewhat weaker performance in Q4, Munich Health slightly missed the
upper-end of our full-year guidance of €50 million to €100 million. To a large extent, this is
due to unfavorable claims experienced in U.S. health reinsurance business.
And now a few remarks on the investment result. In the last quarter, reduced impairments
on equities resulted in lower net write-downs than in the third quarter. However, there
were also reductions in net gains from disposals. Losses on derivatives were somewhat
higher, mainly in primary life and health, where equity derivatives and interest rate hedges
lost value.

FINAL

In reinsurance, the result from commodity and inflation derivatives improved significantly
against the substantial losses experienced in Q3. For the full-year 2015, we are quite
pleased with an investment result of €7.5 billion, given the low interest rates. Our cautious
investment policy, prudent duration management and high degree of diversification once
more proved beneficial. The strong U.S. dollar compensated for the impact of low yields
on regular income.
Although we almost refrained from active harvesting, we recorded slightly higher disposal
gains. These mitigated net losses on derivatives that we are prepared to accept as they
support economic stability. The decline in investment income compared to 2014 was
mainly due to higher write-downs, which were a consequence of elevated capital market
volatility. But you can rest assured that, going forward, we do not intend to change by
taking on substantially higher investment risks.
We want our shareholders to benefit from the Group's good performance. The increase
in the dividend to €8.25 per share is further confirmation of our attractive and reliable
dividend policy and our trust in Munich Re's sustainable earnings power.
Thanks for listening. I am now happy to take your questions.

Thank you, Jörg. Now, quickly back to the operator. Just one remark, please, as always,
my typical housekeeping; a maximum of two questions per person, please, in order to
give everybody a fair chance to ask their questions.
Thank you. We can now start with the Q&A. Who is the first?

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will take our first question from Xinmei Wang from Morgan Stanley. Please
go ahead.

Q - Xinmei Wang

{BIO 17860767 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning, it's Xinmei Wang from Morgan Stanley. My first question was on
reserving. I was wondering if you could give some more detail on the reserve increase in
ERGO liability lines, what it relates to in particular, any underwriting years or lines. And
maybe also on the reserve strengthening in Turkey and how that relates to the overall
reserve buffer of the Group.
My second question is on energy. I appreciate you don't normally split this out, but given
what's happened to the oil price, I was wondering if you could provide us your exposure
to energy in your portfolio. Is there anything we should be factoring in here? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Jörg Schneider
Hi, Xinmei. I'd start with reserving in ERGO. This is general liability business and refers to a
couple of years. Nothing serious, I can say. Yeah, so it's just to increase the level of
comfort and to bring it closer to the level in reinsurance. Different in Turkey; in Turkey,
we've been suffering from a constant move upwards of the personal injury claims. And
the last trigger here was a change in the minimum wage law, which just came up in the
first days of this year, which has direct impact in the personal injury claims and the
reserves. And we had to move upwards, and then we, within the reasonable range of
best estimates, we went to the upper-half, I would say. But this is unfortunate. So, we are
still suffering from old claims, whereas the current business is in good shape.
And your third question, could you repeat it? I'm sorry. I was so busy in looking up the first
one.

Q - Xinmei Wang

{BIO 17860767 <GO>}

Okay. It was on energy, on your energy exposure, given what's happened on the oil price,
could you give us an indication of your exposure there? Is there anything we should be
factoring in?

A - Jörg Schneider
Yeah. So, are you referring to investments here?

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Xinmei Wang

{BIO 17860767 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Jörg Schneider
Yes. Okay. It's a substantial exposure. But overall, you must see our corporates only make
up some 10% of our overall fixed income portfolio. And within that part of the portfolio,
we more or less invest according to the big indices, where oil and gas plays a substantial
role. The reason is that the oil and gas industry is a heavy lender – debtor, and therefore
it's in line with the market. We observe it with some caution, but it does not develop into a
major problem of us, due to the fact that our overall corporates exposure is relatively low
in comparison to the market.

Q - Xinmei Wang

{BIO 17860767 <GO>}

Okay. Great. Thank you.

We will take our next question from In-Yong Hwang from Goldman Sachs. Please go
ahead.

Q - In-Yong Hwang

{BIO 18784369 <GO>}

FINAL

Hi. It's In-Yong from Goldman Sachs. Two questions from me. Firstly on the very significant
reserve release that we saw in the fourth quarter, just a bit more detail on where it's
coming from. And we're seeing obviously a run rate above the 4% normalized level for
the full year. But when you kind of look at the reserving position, do you kind of see
maybe not quite this level, but a level above the 4% being sustained for the foreseeable
future? That's my first question.
And second question on your net income for 2016, I think I saw something in the media
about Jörg, you're saying that the earnings going forward won't be below €2.5 billion. Just
wanted to check whether that was correctly attributed to you. And just wondering on kind
of the confidence behind that, given that it was kind of the low-end of your guidance for
last year? And kind of – so the dynamics in the underlying reinsurance market seems to be
telling you that things are probably going down rather than up. So yeah, just a bit on the
guidance for next year. Thank you.

A - Jörg Schneider

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Thank you, In-Yong. I'll start with your first question on reserve releases. From a line
of business perspective, the impact is driven by property lines and to a lesser extent by
third-party liability, engineering and marine. And especially what I want to emphasize is we
have not weakened our strong balance sheet. I don't know whether I can predict
something for next year, because we do not willingly over-reserve here. But I do not have
a reason to believe that the situation changes dramatically, as long as inflation stays so
low. This is a caveat I have to make.
With regard to our guidance for 2016, if you look at the 2015 result, we had the factor of
good luck with major losses, the A versus E, so the reserve release is clearly above 3%.
We had, on the other hand, FX losses. And if you take all these one-offs, these and many
others, and you could argue long time what has to be adjusted for and what not, but you
end up somewhere between €2.5 billion and €2.7 billion or so. So this could be the
baseline for next year.
Then we have ongoing pressure from the low yields. We have somewhat mitigated, but
still ongoing pressure from the rates. So let's say that we can seriously earn €2.5 billion,
and then we are sitting on a very strong balance sheet. And it's, according to my own
experience, when this balance sheet runs itself off over time, it is only natural that you
have additional gains. Therefore, it's too early now, we will do that in March to give a profit
prognosis. But I do not have a reason to believe that we would go below €2.5 billion. And I
would rather think that there is some space above. But I have to keep it so general at the
moment.

Q - In-Yong Hwang

{BIO 18784369 <GO>}

Yeah. No, I completely appreciate that. Thank you.

We will take our next question from Michael Huttner from JPMorgan.

FINAL

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 21417183 <GO>}

Fantastic. Thank you very much. And I had two questions. One is, in the past, you said that
hedging, you would look at it, the hedging for commodities. And I just wondered whether
that was already done when you'd spoken about that in Q3 or, in other words, taking off
the energy part, which doesn't seem to correlate with much at the moment. And then –
and maybe you can say how much of that is in the investment income. I guess it's all the
derivative loss?
And then, the other question is the solvency. So 260% was a figure we had in – or you said
in November. And now, say, it's even above Q4 (20:51) last year, so above 277%, so let's
round it to 280%. How do you jump 20 points in a quarter? It's fantastic, but if you can
explain how that works, that'd be really lovely. Thank you.

A - Jörg Schneider

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Michael, good morning. First, commodities, yeah, we had somewhat reduced our
exposure to these derivatives here, but it's still there, yeah. So, reduced, but not to zero.
And the losses we had here is not only from the commodities and from the inflation
linkers, but also from equity derivatives, yeah. So therefore it's a mixture. But it's fine,
yeah. So I don't worry too much, I must admit. It looks so ugly, but it's part of an overall
well-balanced investment policy.
And the ratio for – and our economic solvency ratio, we do not have a precise number yet.
But in tendency, we should have benefited from a number of factors, be it interest rates,
be it FX. And that means when we do very simple calculations here, which are to some
extent reliable already, then we should end up slightly higher than at the end of 2014 and
clearly higher than at the end of third quarter. This is the number we published in London
when we explained all the methodology of our Solvency II economic solvency ratio here.
So, I'm very confident that it will end up in this area.

FINAL

Hi. Thank you very much, Jörg. First of all, how would you help us characterize the awful
numbers that ERGO has printed? Is there an element of kitchen sinking going on here so
that Markus can be more optimistic from January 2016, or do you think there is still a sign
that there are a number of underlying problems in ERGO, that means the outlook for 2016
and beyond should still be somewhat cautious?
And then secondly, can you give us an update on whether Munich's strategic thinking has
developed in terms of the opportunities for M&A in the primary and reinsurance market
versus your appetite for capital repatriation? Just sort of general strategic update there,
please.

A - Jörg Schneider
Thank you, William. Good morning. Kitchen sinking, officially not. We do not give any order
that they should present everything which could turn into a loss during the next couple of
years. But I wouldn't be surprised if at one or the other location in the Group, one had the
tendency to be a little bit more on the conservative side in such a phase of new start, so
that you do not want to come up with surprises one or two years later. Therefore I think it
will be something in the middle. On one hand, a quite cautious look at a number of
existing problems, on the other hand, not very rigorous and extreme action of kitchen
sinking. Second question.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Jörg, if I may just butt in. I'm sorry, just to come back on that. Again, just given what you
said about the Group earnings, €2.5 billion or higher, directionally within that, are you
assuming that ERGO is already able to achieve the 2015 target that it failed to reach or
could ERGO still be underperforming against what you think is a normal target?

A - Jörg Schneider
That is, it could still underperform. So we got accustomed to our reinsurance operations
producing much more than originally anticipated. We cannot build any prognosis on
another year of good luck; that doesn't help. But the strong balance sheet could also
produce additional earnings. So when we talk about IFRS results, then it's not our intention
to give up our prudence with regard to reserving or with regard to tax reserves or things
like that. But as I said before, and I would be surprised if all these sources of additional
IFRS earnings would come to an end now, and that means there could be an additional
room for compensation.
With regard to ERGO, it's premature now to say. There could be an impact from the
change itself, yes, be it restructuring expenses, be it write-downs here or there, but I do
not have any clear evidence for it at the moment, so it's a bit too early. And any positive
impact from changes will only show up in the following years, and I'm sure that they will
show up, but not in 2016.
So therefore let's say, if ERGO is still somewhat lagging behind its mid-term potential, that
could be compensated by other sources here. But this is quite general and you can't do a

FINAL

lot with that. But when I look at the IFRS earnings of the last couple of years, they turned
out to be extremely resilient.
On your second question, no major change about our view about M&A. We have been
and are interested in making fantastic acquisitions at good prices. Unfortunately they are
not easily at hand here and I do not see a change here, because so many companies are
currently desperately looking for growth and investing in enterprise acquisitions, that we
still see a level of prices which does not adequately reflect the challenges from the
business. Therefore, I personally regard it as highly improbable that we do very big
acquisitions. You might see mid-sized ones like you did in the past. But I hope that you can
rely on us being on the rather conservative side when it comes to valuations here.

We will take our next question from Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Hi there. Thanks. Just a quick question on the German GAAP earnings, which you said, I
think, were €2.6 billion or €2.5 billion after the goodwill write-down, implying a very high
level of underlying German GAAP earnings. I'm just trying to relate that to what a
sustainable level of German GAAP earnings is going forward. I appreciate there's yet
another benefit from a reduction or even a reversal of equalization reserves to occur
beyond this year. But were there some gains or other positive one-offs inflating that
number? Or is the underlying €3.5 billion (28:32) of German GAAP, is that sort of the
ongoing run rate? I'm just trying to – just some guidance there would be useful.
And very quick second question. What was the net benefit to the combined ratio – the
normalized combined ratio for the full-year from FX? Thanks.

A - Jörg Schneider
Easy one is your second question, roughly 0.5%, yeah, so positive impact from FX. That
means our U.S. business is more profitable than the average and therefore we have a
positive impact here.
Your first question, extremely strong German GAAP result in spite of the write-down of
the ERGO shares, it's partially sustainable, partially also driven by positive effects. Let's
take – we have, for example, a write-up also not to the same magnitude as to write-down.
With regard to our U.S. American operation, we had again very low taxation under local
German GAAP, and we had an excellent underwriting result driven by low major losses

FINAL

and the reserve releases. And in spite of the contribution to the equalization reserve, we
had a positive net underwriting result, which was fantastic. So very good circumstances, I
would say.
Going forward, for 2016, we do not expect further need to contribute to the equalization
reserve, which is beneficial, and for 2017, even a major reduction in the equalization
reserve. Both should support our distribution capacity. Therefore, I'm today very confident
that the current level of distributions can be sustainable for a long while.
Yeah, so I was always concerned. I never wanted to propose to my colleagues and to the
Supervisory Board distributions, where we can already see that our revenue reserves
would expire over a reasonable mid-term period. But this is not the case. So I'm very
confident that the very high distributions of Munich Re can go on.
On the other hand, I do not want to create too much fantasy that we have a huge one-off
step or so. So please take our boring attitude, our reliability also as a plus from a capital
market perspective. Thank you, Andrew.

We'll now move to our next question from Olivia Brindle from Bank of America. Please go
ahead.

Q - Olivia Brindle

{BIO 17273762 <GO>}

Hi there. So two questions from me. Firstly on the renewals. Just around your volumes, I
was wondering if you could explain the differential versus last year. I mean the pricing
trend wasn't that different. And last year you sort of went through explaining that half of
that was from big transactions, half of that was from various other things. So could you just
talk through what the volume trends were this time around? That would be helpful.
And then the second question, you say that overall you are comfortably above your cost
of capital at this point, which makes sense. I was just wondering whether that (32:18) are
parts of your portfolio where that is no longer true, sort of pockets within that. That would
be helpful to hear. So thank you.

A - Jörg Schneider
Good morning, Olivia. Thank you. First, a lot came from major transactions and also very
pleased that we see some business from – which is Solvency II-driven, which we had
always hoped for but never showed up. But now that it becomes reality, we also see
business coming here.

FINAL

There's also the FX effect. We were quite strong in casualty proportional business
because we saw there a quite good stabilization. So overall it is a well balanced picture at
the moment.
Cost of capital, there were buckets where we do not – do no longer earn our cost of
capital. In most cases, we withdrew from the coverage here. In other cases, we stayed
within the contracts because we could either subsidize it from other sources or in very
specific cases, where we see a strong chance that this client we develop so favorably that
we will make a lot of money with him over time. But it's a mixed picture meanwhile. For
example, in marine offshore business, that is an example which I can give you, there we
would say that we are already below our cost of capital.

Q - Olivia Brindle

{BIO 17273762 <GO>}

Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. And then maybe just could you make a quick
comment on cat in that context? Is cat still above cost of capital, would you say?

A - Jörg Schneider
U.S. cats, yes, that is okay. In other areas it's mixed, yeah. So for example, Europe was
worse than U.S. U.S. proved to be more stable here.

We will take our next question from Frank Kopfinger from Deutsche Bank. Please go
ahead.

Q - Frank Kopfinger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. I have two questions. My first question will be also again on your
economic solvency position. Are you somehow worried on the high volatility that we see in
this number? Is this the new normal that we should expect or are there also some
instruments, I would say, to mitigate this volatility?
And my second question is on tax provisions. I believe that you did not use additional tax
provision releases in Q4. But could you confirm this and also provide an outlook on what
we should expect in terms of tax provision releases going forward and how they
contribute to the 2016 guidance?

A - Jörg Schneider

FINAL

Frank, good morning. Your question on high volatility, our economic solvency ratio is
volatile, but we are not concerned because we are on such a high level and it doesn't
make a lot of a difference whether you are 260% or 290% or so.
And the other reason is that, unlike others, we do not use some tools to stabilize it
artificially, if I may say so. Yeah. So for example, no dynamic volatility adjuster, things like
that. That means that we show our exposure to capital market movements because we
can afford it, yeah. And because this gives us internally better information and gives us the
necessary stimulus to reduce volatility where we regard this as being appropriate. That is
the huge advantage for us of running an internal model which is fully in line with our
internal steering and which is very close to economic realities that helps us enormously.
But that explains partially the high volatility of the numbers you see from the outside.
Second, tax provisions, difficult to answer. I can confirm that there were no major
movements in the fourth quarter. What will happen in 2016, I don't know. So when we see
an open tax question, then we typically tend to set up the reserve. And in the past, in
some cases, it turns out – it turned out to be more benign than originally anticipated.

Bloomberg Transcript

To predict that for the future is difficult because governance need money, and especially
the German government will need money, if I may say so. And therefore, in tenancy, there
are some new tax rules which could slightly increase our tax rate going forward. But we
still stick to the range between 20% and 25% for the Group, perhaps more on the upper
than on the lower end.

Q - Avinash Singh

{BIO 17348287 <GO>}

Yeah. Hi. Avinash Singh from Nomura. A first question on your ERGO International
business, given that – I mean, the conditions in Poland and Turkey remains challenging,
what's your guidance or view on the combined ratio for 2016?
And secondly, maybe a repeat, but for your 2016 profit guidance, in 2015 operating
numbers you almost had sort of €1.5 billion favorable, sort of €700 million, I can say, ever
normal (38:29) reserve releases of the similar number in terms of a low nat cat losses,
and also higher regular investment income because of a strong dollar. So I mean – and
also the tax rate was lower. So how confident are you with the €2.5 billion floor for 2016
profits? That's my two questions.

A - Jörg Schneider
Thank you, Avinash. First, ERGO International for 2016, yeah, I'm personally very optimistic
with regard to Poland. Poland is by far our most important market here and we have a very
strong company on side (39:10). And I trust that their market position is so strong that
they will reverse the negative trend of the last couple of years. Short-term, it could still be
suffering from the market developments, yeah. So for 2016, it is difficult to predict a
reversal. But going forward, I'm very confident with regard to their strengths and to their
profitability.
Other markets may be more difficult. In Turkey, these are legacy problems. So the current
portfolio is small, but in good shape. But the impact from Turkey from legal expenses U.K.
and so on is nothing in (40:03-40:09). Oh, sorry. I was just told that the microphone was
out there, so I have to repeat. I'm confident with regard to Poland mid-term; short-term,
2016, can still be difficult because the pressure on – in the markets, the competitive
pressure is still strong.

Bloomberg Transcript

With regards to the 2016 result for the Group, yes, it's a challenging time. We have
pressure from investment income, from – still from reinsurance rates. We have the various
one-offs in both directions. Mid-term to long-term, I'm sure that we will succeed in
mobilizing much more profit potential from expanding the barriers of insurance. Shortterm, there are dampening effects, but these dampening effects should be somewhat
mitigated, if not overcompensated by the effects of the strong balance sheet. Therefore,
I'm still confident with regard to our IFRS result for 2015 – for 2016. Thank you, Avinash.

We will take our next question from Michael Haid from MainFirst Bank. Please go ahead.

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Good morning. Two questions. The goodwill impairment in life and
health, €429 million, why did you write-down the goodwill of health insurance? I thought
that was a business which is quite resilient.
And the second question, the book-will (41:55) write-down of ERGO, the €1.1 billion, what
exactly did you write-down? I mean the book value, you must have written down
something on the asset side, I guess.

A - Jörg Schneider
Yeah. Michael, good morning. Health is very resilient. Good profits and also from an
economic point of view in good shape, but it's part of the same segment, yeah. So we
were forced to compare the value we see in this segment with the book values. And since
life is under pressure and since we had to reduce our reinvestment assumptions, we had

to write down the whole goodwill. And let me frankly say, we did not make any efforts to
aggressively defend it, which would perhaps been possible within reasonable estimation
ranges.
Second, the goodwill write-down, this is the – the write-down in local GAAP. This is the
write-down of Munich Re on its ERGO's share. That means the same phenomenon, low
interest rates, lower profit expectations here for the whole ERGO translated into a
revaluation and to a loss from impairment. That's an asset impairment here.

We will take our next question from Andy Broadfield from Barclays. Please go ahead.

Q - Andy D. Broadfield

{BIO 7273415 <GO>}

Hi, Jörg. Two questions, please. On the proportional side of the renewals, I think you'd
make (43:57) assumptions around the underlying primary trends in order to reach your
overall 1% price decline. I was just wondering whether you could give us some color on the
main components of that. Your peer avoids that discussion yesterday and typically does,
but you try to do this, take some view on that, so I'd appreciate that color.
And secondly, in your very good disclosure, you gave last year on Solvency II. I was just
wondering around the economic earnings whether – two things, whether the things like
the reserve releases and these balance sheet strength, they largely – in my assumptions,
they largely come through the economic earnings as well.
And secondly, whether the level of economic earnings, it was coincidentally, in 2014, very
similar to the IFRS number, but clearly they move very differently. Just whether you feel
that the direction of that is broadly consistent with the messages you've been giving
about renewals, et cetera.

FINAL

Your second question – Andy, good morning. Yes. So we do not have better indications at
the moment. So the reserve releases and the good luck with major losses translate itself
into economic earnings one by one. Then we have the impact from the changes in the
capital market, but these were minor, the economic earnings here, because we see – in
spite of the huge volatility in the course of the year, we'll see a surprising level of, how
should I say, of stability when I just compare end 2014 with end 2015.
With regard to proportional business, I also listened into Hannover Re's conference
yesterday and I found it also interesting that in accordance with their earlier practice, that
they do not give pricing guidance for the proportional business. We try to include that into
our number on the basis of original rates here which we expect to be rather stable.
In the U.S., there could be increasing pressure, which – and we assume a development
which is flat to up to minus 2%, 3% or so. But overall, our assumption is stable rates in
primary insurance. And this is what we build into our calculation for the overall price
change. And we feel quite comfortable in the last couple of years that worked pretty well.
Thank you, Andy.

Q - Andy D. Broadfield

{BIO 7273415 <GO>}

Thanks, Jörg. Can I just say very quickly, last year 2014 – or the 2014 disclosure, economic
effects was quite a big positive and I know there are some other negatives, particularly
around ERGO and the operating earnings. I was just wondering whether we should be
looking at that operating earnings adjusted for the ERGO – the big ERGO negative last
year as a sort of base line. We should assume some positive economic effect as a matter
of course.

A - Jörg Schneider
The economic effect just compare the end of 2014 to 2015, yeah. So this is – we'd not
have the same impact as we had in the course of 2014, because in 2014 the interest rates
went drastically down, whereas in 2015 they were between start and end, more or less
similar. Therefore, I do not expect many – or a lot of negative effects here from – yeah?

Hi. Good morning, gentlemen. I have a follow-up question on the cost of capital. What are
you currently putting in your assumptions for the underwriters? Is it based on RORAC? Is it
already based on Solvency II capital?

FINAL

And my second question is on the renewals. From a technical standpoint, if you sign a deal
with a public scheme, let's say a Flood Re, would we see that in the numbers of these
renewals or is it something that is segregated? Thank you.

A - Jörg Schneider
Good morning, Thomas (48:25). Cost of capital in the order of 8%, but this is highly
subjective, but it's not very aggressive, in my view. Then any business with public schemes
which comes up at 1st January as part of our renewals disclosure here. And in tenancy, it
should have a growing importance over time coming from small origin at the moment.
Thank you.

We will take our next question from Vinit Malhotra from Mediobanca. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Good morning, Jörg. Just one thing I wanted to highlight is that in the manmade claims,
we seem to be frequently above the budget over last three years, four years now. Is
there an internal discussion to review this? And why I ask is because obviously it's
important for normalizing the numbers. That's the first question.
On Solvency II, I just wanted a quick clarification. I missed it, I think. I think you mention a
number of almost 280% or something for the full year, if I'm not mistaken. But does that
include the dividend – oh sorry, does it already count the deduction for dividend or not?
So that's something that I'm a bit confused about. If you could clarify, that would be very
good. Thank you.

A - Jörg Schneider
Hello, Vinit. First, manmade claims, whether there is a discussion to review our prognosis
of 3.5 percentage points, yes, there is. Yeah, so we still see the manmade losses of 2015
as being partially random, but nevertheless, there is an ongoing discussion. And there
could be a change, but I do not expect ending up in a totally different range here,
perhaps a slight increase.
Second, I did not dare to give a number for the economic solvency ratio because this is
just not possible. It's so complicated with adding up all the solvency capital requirement
and the eligible own funds. And with the eligible own funds, we also have some open
points which are in the final clarification with the auditor and with the regulator. So there

FINAL

could also be movements by 10% up or down or so, fortunately on a very comfortable
basis that one, so we are not worried at all. But this is the reason why I would never dare
to give a clear prognosis.
What we do is we only deduct, and that is on your question, dividends which have been
publicly announced at the date of the calculation or to which the calculation refers. This is
different from some competitors, not from all competitors. It is in line with the regulation.
That means only at the end of the first quarter we would deduct the dividend because at
that time the proposal which was made by the board of management to the supervisory
board, which we present today to the capital market, this is for us, the triggering event for
deducting the dividend. So in our calculation for end 2015, the dividend will still be in. But
we will inform the market about that quite clearly and it's an easy calculation.
