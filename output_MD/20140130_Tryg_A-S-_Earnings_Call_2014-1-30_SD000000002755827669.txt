{BIO 18028603 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone. Here's Lars Moeller from Tryg. I'm the Head of Investor
Relations. We are here to present our 2013 results. And with me this morning I have
Morten Hubbe, our CEO, and Tor Lonnum, our CFO.
We have changed our concept slightly so we will do it like an audiocast, so no pictures or
only a picture of Tor and Morten here today. And after the presentation from Morten and
Tor, we will of course have our Q&A session, as usual.
So with these words, over to you, Morten.

Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Thank you, Lars. And if you turn directly to slide 3, we show the Fourth Quarter highlights,
of course impacted signiﬁcantly by 45,000 storm claims in Denmark, where we expect to
pay out DKK650 million prior to reinsurance. And despite that, we deliver a strong result
in the Fourth Quarter.
The pre-tax result is unchanged, roughly, at DKK640m, while the technical result, at
DKK550m, is somewhat below the previous year but clearly above consensus in the
market.

FINAL

If we look at what are the positive result drivers in the Fourth Quarter, clearly we are
helped by an investment income which is DKK150 million higher year on year, but also the
eﬃciency measure program has an impact positively of DKK112 million in the Fourth
Quarter. And as you see, a very signiﬁcant drop in the cost ratio for the quarter. But also
bear in mind that ordinary winter claims and large claims are lower in the Fourth Quarter
than usual.
And if we turn to slide four we show the full year, with a stable pre-tax result of DKK3b,
while the post-tax result is up 7% year on year. Technical result stable, at DKK2.5b;
reported earnings up 8% in private lines and some 46% in our Swedish business.
But clearly, across the board, the core driver is our eﬃciency measurement program, with
a total impact of DKK380 million for the full year, or roughly 2 percentage points to the
combined ratio. And as a result, you see that the cost ratio is down 0.8%, while the
underlying claims is down a bit more than 1 percentage point for the full year.

Bloomberg Transcript

And I guess that is the main reason why we're able to absorb the storm, which costs
DKK400 million after reinsurance, but also that the year-on-year weather comparison is
helped by the fewer winter claims. So all in all, weather cost DKK260 million more in 2013
than 2012. And all in all, that results in even a slightly improved combined ratio for the full
year.
If we turn to slide 5, clearly the more important news is our continued work on new
products and price diﬀerentiation. In 2013, we have come to the market with as many new
products as the previous seven years put together. And with all of our new products, we
see that our hit ratio on sales is higher and we see that our improved price diﬀerentiation
improves selection and reduces our expected claims from new customers signiﬁcantly,
and that's why it's extremely important to continue that trend in 2014 and 2015.
We also announced today two new IT agreements. Our IT infrastructure sourcing is
moved from CSC to Tata in India and our application development, which has been inhouse so far, is now being outsourced to Accenture, both of which will be important to
support that we reach our cost targets.
On slide 6, we show how the businesses contribute to the combined ratio, clearly with the
main improvement in private lines where combined ratio is down 1.7 percentage points,
and Sweden where combined ratio is down 4.1 percentage points. Commercial and
corporate are slightly higher than the year before but still report a combined ratio of 88%
and 89%, respectively, including the signiﬁcantly higher weather claims.
On slide 7, we show the key initiatives strategically, both for 2013 and 2014. And as you
see from the top, clearly we continue with increased price diﬀerentiation being the
number one key strategic driver for the longer term, and clearly that is extremely
important. We continue with our DKK1 billion savings program for the short and medium
term, until 2015, as a key driver of earnings.

FINAL

Then we add customer journey and what we call success culture, because we believe that
we will be able to improve our customer experience, our customer loyalty, by making
much more simple and much more eﬀective our customer contact points, and through
that create more value with our customers than today. And that will also include raising
the performance culture in the organization, both to the beneﬁt of our customers and our
bottom line.
If we turn to slide 8, clearly the eﬃciency program the main driver of earnings
improvement in 2013, and that will be the case in 2014 and 2015 as well; DKK380 million
impact in 2013, DKK1 billion total program by 2015. And it basically means that we still
have some DKK460 million to deliver for 2014 and 2015, which will positively impact
earnings.
And on slide nine we show the cost part of the impact, where clearly the reduction in cost
ratio is very signiﬁcant at 0.8 percentage points, now 15.6%, and we remain with a target
to reduce the cost ratio to below 15% in 2015. Bear in mind that you also see that the
nominal costs are actually down almost DKK300m, also to manage the lower top line, and
that we are 200 heads fewer than the year before.
And over to you, Tor.

Tor Lonnum

{BIO 16534375 <GO>}

Thank you, Morten. If we move to slide number 11, ﬁrst and foremost we see that there is
still some decline on the top line, both in nominal and in ﬁxed currency, albeit relatively
high decline due to the fall in or the drop of the price of the Norwegian krone.
If we look at the underlying related to the private lines, you can see that if you adjust for
premium and proﬁt-sharing agreements there is actually a more or less ﬂattish
development in Q4, which we think is a positive development.
If we look at the technical result, it has improved in corporate. There is a decline in the
other areas, due to the weather related events, as Morten commented.
If we move to slide number 12, you can see that in terms of customer retention there is a
positive -- continued positive development in terms of private lines in Norway. We see
that there is a decline this quarter as well in Denmark, primarily due to the competition
level.
If we look at the commercial side, there is a positive development in Denmark. I think we
have mentioned before that we have seen a high number of foreclosures and
bankruptcies in Denmark. We see that there is a small positive trend in that area now. In
terms of the Norwegian portfolio, there is a small decline in the retention level, but we
think that is more or less temporarily.

FINAL

If we move on to slide number 13, the house prices, house prices reﬂect the indexation in
Denmark. If you look at the increase in average premium, we see that it's a somewhat
smaller increase in Norway but more or less in line with inﬂation.
If you look at the motor portfolio in Denmark, there is a small decline in the average
premium. It reﬂects two things. I think we have mentioned before the size of the new cars
being sold is relatively speaking smaller, but we also see a small shift in terms of
coverage, so that people doesn't select CASCO as frequently as we've seen before.
If we move to slide number 14, looking at the Swedish portfolio, you can see that in terms
of the retention levels there is still a continued impact of the Nordea portfolio, and I guess
that is a development that we will continue to see throughout 2013 -- sorry, 2014.
In terms of the proﬁtability levels, it's a relatively strong proﬁtability, as Morten mentioned.
I guess it's worth mentioning that if you compare to Q4 2012, you see that there was some
accrual issues in last year's numbers. So I guess, more or less, if you look at the year
overall it's a positive development.

Bloomberg Transcript

If we move to slide number 16, as Morten mentioned initially, you can see that there is an
improvement in underlying for the quarter of about 0.2 percentage points, so marginally
better than last year. We see that private continues to improve; we see that there is a small
negative in commercial and Sweden. I've mentioned Sweden before, but it's important to
note that commercial is coming from a very strong level in last year's numbers, and we do
see an improvement in the corporate segment in Q4.
I guess it's worth mentioning as well that if you compare to the next level sourcing, the
procurement initiatives that we have mentioned before, we see that there is smaller
impact than the reported numbers. And I think it's important to say that some of that will
be reﬂected in the weather numbers, but some of it will also be due to price level
changes in the market.
If we move on to slide number 17, we can see that one of the key reasons why, as Morten
mentioned initially, there's not such a huge impact from weather related claims in Q4 is
due to the fact that large claims is signiﬁcantly lower than last year. It's actually as much as
3.2 percentage points. Run-oﬀ is slightly better than last year but more or less ﬂattish.
If we move to slide number 19, as Morten mentioned, there is a strong performance in
terms of investment returns in Q4, DKK150 million more than last year, primarily driven by
equities but also some returns on high yield. There has been both some upward and
some downward movements in terms of interest rates in Q4, and that has also given some
yield.
There is a number of one-oﬀs in Q4, related to the adjustment of the value of the HQ but
also some minor value adjustments in the real estate and the equity portfolio.

If we move to slide number 20, you can see that the buﬀer capital in terms of the
Individual Solvency is at 50% after dividend, a strong and favorable position.

FINAL

As we have mentioned before, there will be new regulation in Denmark in Q1. We do
think that that will give a small shift upwards in terms of capital requirement, but it
shouldn't be a signiﬁcant impact. We're talking in the area of some DKK100m. If we look
at the development in pure equity, it's more or less ﬂattish.
And I guess that leaves it back to you, Morten.

Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

And I guess we can summarize that we are quite pleased that we're able to handle the
two signiﬁcant storms while still delivering a strong development in our bottom line result,
and clearly satisﬁed that the main driver is our eﬃciency measurement program, which
will also be the main driver of earnings improvement in 2014 and 2015.
And on slide 21, we just summarize our ﬁnancial targets. The combined ratio we target at
or below 90%. The expense ratio we target below 15% in 2015. And the ROE we target at
20% post-tax also in years where the investment income might be more normal or lower
than we saw in 2013.

And with that, I think we have concluded our presentation.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Per Gronborg, Danske Markets.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Hello. It's Per Gronborg from Danske. One question related to the storm impact. You had
two big storms in Denmark, a number of medium-sized events in Norway. You state in
your report that you have DKK150 million for own account on each event. How have you
been able to limit the total impact to DKK255m, which is pretty impressive?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well I guess we can say, Per, that we have the DKK150 million for own account per event
and then we pay the reinstatement premium for each, and the total of that, in eﬀect, is
DKK400 million for the two events. Then I guess limiting that further on the total weather

Page 5 of 17



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2014-01-30

impact is mainly that weather in general on winter, etc., has been lower. So if you look at
the two storms net/net, bottom line, they are actually DKK400m.

FINAL

A - Tor Lonnum

{BIO 16534375 <GO>}

And I guess, just to supplement Morten in terms of the weather events you talk about in
Norway, Per, they're so limited in their eﬀect that it doesn't really have a large inﬂuence in
the numbers. And bear in mind that the winter has been extremely favorable both in
Norway and in Denmark in Q4. And so I guess if you look at the overall impact, yes, there
was some signiﬁcant weather events, but there were also some positive events that took
the total eﬀect down.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

What has the cost been for the four events in Norway?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Sorry?

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

What has the cost been for the two medium-size storms in Norway and the two smaller
storms we had in Norway in the Fourth Quarter?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Tor Lonnum

{BIO 16534375 <GO>}

A very, very limited eﬀect. It's not very visible. We're talking in the area of low -- I would
say somewhere below DKK20m, so it doesn't really have a large impact.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Operator
Hakon Fure, DnB Markets.

Q - Hakon Fure

{BIO 16623060 <GO>}

Yes. Hi. Good morning. It's Hakon from DnBNor. A few questions. Firstly, on the sideways
reinsurance, could you remind us how much of the DKK500 million in weather related
claims you're expecting for this year that you expect in the ﬁrst half? And am I right in
assuming that, given that you're now in the money on the sideways reinsurance, we
should expect, eﬀectively, no weather related claims in the ﬁrst half?
And secondly, on run-oﬀs, am I right -- if inﬂation remains close to zero in Denmark,
should we expect the current run-oﬀ gains level to remain, going forwards?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}
Page 6 of 17



Company Name: Tryg A/S

FINAL

Well I guess if I comment on the run-oﬀ and you can comment on the reinsurance. I think,
Hakon, on the run-oﬀ, we will remain with our previous communication that long term we
are in the region of 2.5%, roughly, of run-oﬀ gains, whereas the roughly 5% we're at
currently is also something we would expect for the shorter-term future. And I guess, all in
all, our assessment is that our reserving margin at the end of 2013, if anything, is slightly
higher than at the beginning of 2013.
And reinsurance?

A - Tor Lonnum

{BIO 16534375 <GO>}

Yes. Hi, Hakon. I guess it's important to say that, in terms of the sideways cover, you are
right that we're more or less covered in terms of larger weather related events, but bear in
mind that it's always a threshold on the bottom of DKK20m. Did you understand that?

Q - Hakon Fure

{BIO 16623060 <GO>}

Yes. That's perfect. And ﬁnally, given the proﬁtability that we're seeing in some products,
especially motor comprehensive, how do you see prices trending in 2014 compared to
2013?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Tor Lonnum

{BIO 16534375 <GO>}

We're talking -- if we should split the question between Norway and Denmark, I guess, I
think I have mentioned already that in terms of the Danish market we have seen
competitive pressure. I guess our take is that we should be able to push through the
annual indexation. But there's no doubt that the competitive pressure in the Danish
market is noticeable, and that's really why we need to continue to focus on our internal
improvement programs, which is going to be the main driver for proﬁtability.
In terms of the Norwegian market, I think I'd argue that it's slightly more benign in terms
of competitive level, but the large uncertainty is really related to the macro development
in 2014.

Operator
Jakob Brink, ABG.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 7556154 <GO>}

It's Jakob from ABG. Just three questions. The ﬁrst one's relating to the combined ratio in
Norway. It's extremely low, at 78% in the Fourth Quarter, but also it's a very big movement
compared to last year in the Fourth Quarter. Could you maybe give a bit more detail on
that one?
Then secondly, Tor, you mentioned that premiums had actually been roughly stable in the
Fourth Quarter, if you adjusted for currency and bonus -- sorry, proﬁt sharing, but still you
do write that it's down 1.5% year on year and 2.4% in local currency. Isn't that a worrying
development still, that premiums keeps declining quarter after quarter, and what exactly
Page 7 of 17



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2014-01-30

are you going to do about it? You said that you are expecting to push the indexation. Is
there any risk that you might not do that?

FINAL

Then, thirdly, did you mention anything about the Solvency II capital requirement, that
you expected that to go up in 2014, and if so, how much? Thank you.

A - Tor Lonnum

{BIO 16534375 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you, Jakob. The ﬁrst question, in terms of what is going on in terms of
movements in Norway, I think ﬁrst and foremost, and I guess Morten mentioned that as
well, if you look at Norway in Q4 I think it is almost unprecedented with a combined ratio
below 80, so that is a really strong result. And it goes back to Per's question as well, about
the impact of weather related claims.
I think ﬁrst and foremost it's important to understand that when you do the comparison to
the same quarter last year, there was a signiﬁcant impact of large claims in the numbers
last year, which -- it moves around about 10 percentage points in terms of combined ratio.
Then if you add weather related events on top of that, that explains the signiﬁcant change
in terms of combined ratio. If you -- sorry.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Then I guess on your second question, Jakob, on premiums, you're absolutely right that
there's still a negative top line development in 2013, which we're perfectly willing to
accept. But what we do see is that there is less of a negative trend in Q4 than in the full
year. We also see several business segments where there's a slight positive net number of
customers development during the autumn.
And if we look at the coming years, what is positive is that our commercial customer
loyalty and retention is increasing. Our private lines retention in Norway is increasing. But
we still need to improve our retention rate in private lines Denmark, where we've been a
bit surprised at how much sales Trop[ph] is able to carry out with Danske Bank, and that is
the main driver of retention being slightly lower than planned.
But what we actually do about it is not by hesitating carrying out the market indexation on
price. But what we'd rather do is we work on the new products and the price
diﬀerentiation where, as I said, clearly, the new products we have already done, the hit
ratio on sales is higher and the quality of the risk is also higher, so the expected claims
ratio of these new customers is actually lower than just a year ago and two years ago. So
that is a strong, also longer term, valuable way of moving it.
But also, more short term, we have increased slightly our sales eﬀorts for 2014. We will do
more outbound cross-sales. We will do a bit more franchising business in Norway, to
increase our sales there a little bit. Then we expect to do more bancassurance, which is
one of the strongest quality customer bases we have.
And I guess we've seen with Trop and Danske that it can be moved further upwards, and
we plan to do that with Nordea in both Denmark and Norway. Then we start up our new
Page 8 of 17



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2014-01-30

cooperation with Danske Bank in Sweden. I think, as Tor said, that the lapse or the loss of
Nordea customers in Sweden, that will continue, because eﬀectively that is a small run-oﬀ
portfolio with an agreement that we no longer have.

FINAL

A - Tor Lonnum

{BIO 16534375 <GO>}

Yes. Then, on the ﬁnal question about the Solvency II, as you mentioned, Jakob, there will
be a change in Danish regulation, and we do expect that that will adjust the individual
solvency requirements somewhat upwards. We're still in the midst of calculations, but I
would say that we're talking in the area of DKK200 million to DKK400m. So that's why I
said it wouldn't be signiﬁcant, but we would see an upward shift.

Hi. Good morning. Just two questions from my side. The ﬁrst one, I just wanted to follow
up on all the comments on Danish private. My question is whether you felt any impact
coming from aggregators during the last quarter of the year.
And secondly, you continue to deliver ahead of schedule on the cost program. Just
wondering if that's due to the bringing forward of the program or whether you've been
able to identify additional opportunities as you've gone along. Those are my two
questions. Thank you.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I think, on your ﬁrst question, the answer, if you look at the actual numbers, is no. There's
no real impact. The only area where we've seen aggregators being slightly successful in
the Nordic scenery has been in Sweden with Insplanet. And now we see that Insplanet is
losing business to the next new aggregator, so they're cannibalizing each other a bit.
What has happened, though, is that there is more attempt to put light on the pricing on
motor, which has led us to a discussion on our bundling discount between motor and
other products, in the sense that more than 90% of our customers buy motor and one
more product, at least. But every time a price is displayed on the Internet, it is displayed
prior to that discount. So it leaves us to not want to reduce prices in any way, but want to
show the bundling discount in a way that doesn't take us oﬀ the screening process of the
customers.
So really, Internet still plays a very, very low role, but we see that customers more
frequently use the Internet for screening and then they call us, and clearly those are the
best leads we have. So still very, very slow movement in that area.

FINAL

A - Tor Lonnum

{BIO 16534375 <GO>}

Yes. Hi, Daniel. In terms of the cost program, I guess it's fair to say that it's a valid
comment you make, and I think Morten mentioned the drop in nominal expenses. We
see, actually, for Fourth Quarter alone that it's a drop of DKK100 million in nominal
expenses. So yes, we are quite pleased with the development in terms of the eﬃciency
programs. And as Morten mentioned, we also have the agreement with -- the new
agreement with Tata and Accenture, which we think will support the cost program that we
have initiated.
However, I think it's fair to say that we are -- we have realized slightly more than 45% of
the total target, and thus I think it's too soon to say that we are going to do any steps in
terms of the targets for the cost program. I think at the moment, at least, we're more or
less focused on making sure that we will be able to realize the targets that have been set.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

But we're happy with the results in the pipeline for the next couple of years. That will keep

Gianandrea Roberti, Carnegie.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning, from me as well. A couple of questions on aspects that you have
already touched upon. I think in the last six months in the Danish market, if I leave aside
what is probably Denmark's ﬁrst real aggregator, I can count at least six, seven new
ventures. Some of them are brand new, but some of them are actually companies that
were looking at niche markets, niche segments, actually, and then they are now deciding
to make it full blown in the private market. It's probably the ﬁrst time in 10 years that I've
seen something like that, and I'd like to hear a bit your view.
You're obviously stating that movements, particularly aggregators, are very, very slow. I
would say actually you can't really see them, but then again they've just started. So is this
a threat in the midterm, or how you see this?
Apart from that, DKK350 million to DKK370 million is the net savings from the savings
program in 2014, right? I guess that should be netted oﬀ by some sort of inﬂation. I just
want to double check the assumption there.
And the ﬁnal question, I thought it was an interesting statement in your annual report
where you talk about that in conjunction with the capital plan you have a contingency
plan, should the Company decide the capital position be threatened, and I'd like to know
Page 10 of 17



Company Name: Tryg A/S

if there is a plan also if the Company's capital position is deemed well above the
necessary level. Thanks.

FINAL

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Morning to you as well, Gian. I think, on your ﬁrst question, you are absolutely right that
it's a paradox that on one hand the aggregators in Denmark are not visible at all in the
numbers. On the other hand, you're completely right that there are many new attempts
currently and more new attempts than we have historically seen. I guess the way we view
it, one of these new players have even argued that they are targeting 40% market share in
two years. I don't know whether to laugh or cry about that, but I guess it doesn't sound
very likely.
The way we try to approach it, more seriously, is that when we target a cost ratio below
15%, I have yet to see a player on the Internet with a cost ratio signiﬁcant below that. And
the players that are new to this market, they don't start with a portfolio; they start from
scratch. So they will start with a cost ratio which is signiﬁcantly higher than that level.

Bloomberg Transcript

With the current eﬃciency measures we're doing on claims procurement, our eﬃciency of
paying claims will be dramatically stronger than a newcomer to the market. And what
we're doing currently on selection and price diﬀerentiation means that we are
continuously improving our risk selection and our claims ratio for new players. I've seen
that some of the questions that these newcomers to the Internet will try to post and which
they will base their pricing upon is so simple that I don't ﬁnd it likely at all that they can
actually create proﬁt from that.
So actually, that is the way we approach it. The only real issue we see is the transparency
issue on bundling and pricing, where we are trying to work on methodology where it is
clearer what is our pricing, with or without bundling discount, so that we don't get scored
too negatively in a before bundling discount pricing measurement. That is really the issue
we take the most seriously.

A - Tor Lonnum

{BIO 16534375 <GO>}

Yes. Hi, Gianandrea. I guess you're right in terms of the savings eﬀect full year 2013 is
DKK300 million or somewhat above[ph] DKK380m. And you're right; that was really what
I was trying to indicate earlier in terms of the presentation, that we will see some
competitive pressure. That means that you won't see the full eﬀect of the savings ﬂowing
into the numbers, and I guess that is an eﬀect that you see in Q4.
In terms of contingency plans, yes, there is deﬁnitely a contingency plan for the downside.
In terms of the upside, as you mentioned, I guess that is -- I think Morten was very clear in
his statement. We are aiming for the 20% return on equity target also in 2014.

Sorry. I'm just following up on Tor's comment earlier on the sales trend in comprehensive
motor insurance. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about that, what's
driving that, and particularly in the context of an unbundling debate in Danish motor.
Thank you.

Yes. I guess the comment that I made, Daniel, was really related to, when you look at the
development in terms of the average premium for the portfolio, there has been a trend,
and I think we have mentioned that for the last few quarters, that you do see a shift in
terms of people switching from larger cars to smaller cars, which gives an impact on the
average price per car.
But in addition, of course, you see that there is a somewhat shift where people are not
selecting CASCO, and of course that is related to the fact that if the value of the car is
signiﬁcantly lower people don't select CASCO as a part of the insurance. And that is just
one of the explaining factors for why the average insurance premium is slightly down.

I guess -- on the bundling question, Daniel, I guess there's two diﬀerent debates in the
Danish market, as we see it. One is that if you look at our Norwegian private bundling,
there is a clear incentive for the customer if you even pick up product four, ﬁve or six. The
incentive gets bigger, the more products you pick up. Our current bundling program in
Denmark gives you the full bundling impact already at product number two.
So I think, longer term, we will need to work with bundling in Denmark that creates more
incentive also with further products than just two, while at the same time, at the other end
of the scale, being able to create transparency on what is the motor price after bundling
discount, because more than 90% of the customers actually get that discount. So those
are the two diﬀerent trends.

Okay. That's clear. Thank you.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Yes. Sorry. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. In Norway, in the private lines, I think in
December DnB non-life was telling me that they were raising prices 2%, 3% in 2014 in the
private lines, motor and house, to counter -- to oﬀset the expected claims inﬂation. Is that
something that would -- is that assumption in line with how you see it? That's the ﬁrst
question.
The second question, back on your point on the expense ratio, Morten, the 15% versus the
new entrants, it's my understanding that actually the acquisition cost part of the expense
ratio for an Internet player is around 5% because of the really bone -- the really very, very
small setup and all contacts via Internet, while, if I understand correctly, in Denmark you
have an average acquisition cost around 15% when clients come in from the telephone. It
seems a big diﬀerence, and I'm just wondering if that together with a diﬀerent customer
approach to all this can take away more customers from you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I think, if I take the last question, you can take the ﬁrst one, Tor. Well I guess if the
acquisition cost on the Internet was only 5%, then I guess a company like Admiral should
have a much lower cost ratio than we should, and I guess in eﬀect they don't. So I guess
you're right that as a starting point the structure of the Internet of course creates lower
cost ratios than the traditional distribution levels.
But I don't see a level as low as what you're pointing to, and I guess we have yet to see an
Internet player proving a sustainably below 15% cost ratio. And those are Internet players
or direct players that have been in the market for a long period and have a portfolio to
distribute their costs on, whereas these players are completely new. They have
traditionally, or most of them, have no experience with insurance. So they have no
experience of setting up an eﬃcient process and they have no experience on risk
selection and pricing.
And I seriously doubt that they would come to a cost ratio that is below ours, and I'm
completely sure that they would not come to a claims procurement eﬃciency level that we
are able to deliver and will further strengthen in our program. And I'm completely
conﬁdent that the risk selection that we're improving further and further, as we speak, with
the price diﬀerentiation as being number one strategic initiative, that with the questions
they're asking they would come nowhere close to that risk selection, and also maybe that
will punish their results.

A - Tor Lonnum

{BIO 16534375 <GO>}

And I think, Gianandrea, just to supplement Morten a bit, we do have some experience in
Tryg from using aggregators in Sweden, and I haven't seen a number -- an acquisition
cost in the area of 5%, to be frank. So it might be that that's a new trend in their market,

but at least what we have -- the experience we have from other markets isn't in line with
that kind of number.

FINAL

I guess, to your ﬁrst question in terms of the price increases in private lines, that is in line
with our own expectations.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks. So just to clarify, just to make my point more clearly, was that the 5%
acquisition cost is not from the aggregator but it's from some of these Internet players.
But thanks a lot for your answer. I appreciate that.

Hi. Hello, guys. A very quick question, if I could. Obviously you highlighted that top line is
quite diﬃcult in terms of top line growth. One of your competitors may be about to sell
some assets very close to you in the Baltic region. Would you have any interest at all in
acquiring those? And thank you very much.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well I guess good morning to you as well. We have clearly deﬁned the Nordics as being
our geographical footprint, and we have no plans of acquiring Baltic assets.
And I guess our view is that we are focused primarily on continuously improving our
earnings. We accept that the top line is slightly low for a period. We see an improved
trend towards the end of 2013. Realistically, we will see negative growth in 2014 as well,
but an improvement towards the end of 2014 and then we expect to see a slight positive
top line in 2015. And while we do that and continuously improve our earnings as we move
along, we're perfectly happy with that route.

Hi. Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Two questions, please. One is on the retention
in Denmark. On the commercial side, I see the bar again -- the line again coming back up
in Danish commercial. Is it that new customers are coming in, or is it that the people that
you've cleaned up ones or the portfolio cleaning-up ones and they're just staying on?

FINAL

If you could just comment on that, and it's linked to the growth comment because in 3Q
the underlying was minus 2 and now you mentioned ﬂat, if I recollect. So if you could just
comment on the Danish commercial.
And second question, please, on the underlying combined ratio trend. If I look at last few
years, Fourth Quarter was around 90% in 4Q 2011 then the 85% mark in 4Q 2012, and now
it's again back -- it remains at the 85% mark line. 2012, one of the ideas was that frequency
was abnormally low, and again in 4Q 2013 we are hearing that weather conditions have
helped a lot. Would you say that 4Q 2013 versus 4Q 2011, the 5 points improvement,
would you say most of that was due to this good luck factor, or some of it was some risk
selection features in your portfolio or some other diﬀerentiation features? So if you just
take a two-year view Fourth Quarter, it would be great. Thank you very much.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

If I take your ﬁrst question, on commercial Denmark, I guess it's fair to say that if you go
back just four years our combined ratio in commercial was more than 100. So the price
increases we carried out with Danish commercial customers were very steep, in a period
where the commercial companies in Denmark were really struggling, and as a result we
saw an impact on the retention rate dropping.

Bloomberg Transcript

What we've seen in 2013 and continue to see in 2014 is that we do not have the same
need to carry out signiﬁcant price increases. We also see that our commercial -- we have a
new head of commercial since the autumn, which is working very hard to further improve
eﬃciency for making sure that our -- both risk selection and product oﬀering towards our
commercial companies or customers become stronger and stronger.
And as a result, I think it's very natural to see an upwards trend in the customer retention
rate. We will have a number of customer experience enhancing initiatives in 2014, where
we run a rather large program on that, and as a result we expect the customer retention in
commercial to continue further upwards. And as a result, we should see the negative
trend on commercial top line in total start to become smaller and gradually become
positive, but that is probably in 2015.

A - Tor Lonnum

{BIO 16534375 <GO>}

Yes. Hi. And to the question about the underlying development, I guess you're right; we
did mention that 2012 was a very benign insurance year. And I guess if you look at the
development in the commercial segment, for instance, you do see that there is a
weakening of the underlying numbers, but it comes in from a very, very low level. So I
think that, at least from my point of view, underpins the fact that we had a very benign
2012.
Then I guess, if we move on to 2013 and look at the overall development, clearly, there is
no doubt that there has been a number of weather related events that we have talked
about before, and so you can always deﬁne what is a -- discuss what is a benign insurance
year or not. There is a level of small claims, there is a level of medium-size claims, and you
do see some movements in those areas as well.

So I guess overall we would argue that 2013 has been, as Morten said, initially a good
year. There has been signiﬁcant weather related events. And I guess we stay committed to
our proﬁtability focus for 2014.

FINAL

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

And I guess it's fair to say, while your question is on commercial, that our price
diﬀerentiation initiative started in private lines ﬁrst, and now it's picking up more products
also in commercial lines. So clearly we have a pipeline for the next couple of years to
further improve our commercial products, which will enhance our risk selection further in
commercial and also help our sales in commercial.
We have examples of key products in commercial where the product is 10 years old, and
our future plan is that no product should ever be more than one year old. So clearly a
signiﬁcant step-up in the price diﬀerentiation and risk selection area as number one on
the strategic agenda, and that will help commercial in the coming years.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Thanks. And sorry, the reason I ask is because in 3Q I distinctly remember there was a
comment that you were saying that mid-size claims are going up. That clearly went back
to normal in Fourth Quarter, just to follow up? And maybe that was related to commercial.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Tor Lonnum

{BIO 16534375 <GO>}

That was related to the corporate segment. So you're quite right; we did make a comment
about the corporate segment in Q3. And as you can see from the underlying, there is a
slightly better development in Q4.
However, I don't think we should underestimate the fact that when we look at our Swedish
book of business, for instance, we deﬁnitely need to follow and monitor the situation
closely, going forward. And I guess if you look at the geographic information, you can see
that very clearly.

Q - Vinit Malhotra
