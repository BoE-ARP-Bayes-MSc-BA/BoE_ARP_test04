FINAL

Good morning. Thank you, Nicole. Welcome to the Markel Corporation year-end 2018
conference call. This is Tom Gayner, the Co-CEO of Markel, and it's my pleasure, along
with my Co-CEO, Richie Whitt, and our CFO, Jeremy Noble, to welcome you to our yearend 2018 conference call.
These calls are designed to give you a quick report on current conditions, financial results
and our thoughts on the business environment for the Markel Corporation. We appreciate
your longstanding partnership and interest as we continue to build your company over
time and we look forward to answering your questions at the conclusion of this call.

Bloomberg Transcript

In short, 2018 was a fascinating year for Markel. We posted record revenues. Those
revenues meant we served more customers with more products and services than ever.
The revenues reflect our efforts to grow and expand the scope and scale of the Markel
Corporation over time. Unfortunately, at the same time we're reporting record revenues,
we also reported a comprehensive loss for the year. Our loss in 2018 reflects volatile
equity markets and declines in our equity portfolio, especially in the fourth quarter. We
also experienced mark-to-market losses in our fixed income portfolio from higher overall
levels of interest rates.
The cluster of challenges in 2018 also included a second year in a row of historically high
catastrophe losses in the insurance industry and specific challenges at our CATCo
insurance-linked securities operation. In each and every circumstance of challenge that I
mentioned, I also believe that we learned how to better operate your company and to
continue to build upon the multi-decade record of excellent financial results. We are
optimistic about 2019 and beyond.
At this point, I'm going to turn the call over to Jeremy Noble to give you a quick rundown
on the numbers we just released. Following Jeremy, Richie Whitt will update you on our
insurance operations and then I will return to discuss our investment and Markel Ventures
operations. At that point, we will open the floor for questions. Jeremy?

Jeremy A. Noble

{BIO 20687803 <GO>}

Thank you, Tom, and good morning, everyone. Our 2018 results included another record
year of operating revenues, totaling $6.8 billion, an increase of 13% over 2017. For the
year, our earned premiums grew by 11% to $4.7 billion, while revenues from our Markel
Ventures affiliates increased by 43% to $1.9 billion.
We reported a comprehensive loss of $376 million for the year versus comprehensive
income of $1.2 billion in 2017. The comprehensive loss in 2018 was driven by decreases in
the fair value of our fixed income and equity security portfolios, due to rising interest rates
during 2018, and the decline in the equity markets in the fourth quarter.
Comprehensive income in 2017 included a one-time tax benefit of $340 million as a result
of last year's U.S. tax reform legislation and 2018's comprehensive loss included charges

associated with our Markel CATCo operations. The unfavorable impact of these yearover-year changes was partially offset by underwriting profits of $114 million in 2018 versus
underwriting losses of $207 million in 2017.
Turning to our underwriting results first, gross written premiums within our underwriting
segment was $5.8 billion for the year compared to $5.3 billion in 2017, an increase of 10%.
The increase in gross premium volume was attributable to an increase in our insurance
segment due to the impact from our new surety and collateral protection lines acquired in
2017, along with organic growth across several product lines.
Retention of gross written premiums decreased from 84% in 2017 to 83% in 2018. This
decrease was driven by lower retention on our personal lines business within the
insurance segment and an increase in property catastrophe reinsurance coverage
purchased in 2018 compared to 2017. Earned premiums increased 11% to $4.7 billion in
2018 due to higher written premiums in our insurance segment.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our consolidated combined ratio for 2018 was 98% compared to 105% last year. The
2018 combined ratio included underwriting losses of $287 million, or six points, from
Hurricanes Florence and Michael, Typhoon Jebi and the wildfires in California. The 2017
combined ratio included underwriting losses of $565 million, or 13 points, from Hurricanes
Harvey, Irma, Maria; the earthquakes in Mexico and the wildfires in California. Excluding the
impact of the catastrophe losses in both 2018 and 2017, our combined ratio was 92% in
both years.
Next, I'll cover the results of our Markel Ventures segment. Revenues for Markel Ventures
increased to $1.9 billion in 2018 compared to $1.3 billion a year ago. The increase in
revenues was primarily attributable to Costa Farms, which we acquired in August 2017,
and Brahmin, which we acquired in October 2018, as well as higher sales volumes in both
our products and services businesses.
Operating income for Markel Ventures was $77 million for 2018 compared to $115 million
last year. EBITDA was $170 million for 2018 compared to $188 million last year. In 2018,
operating income and EBITDA were both impacted by expenses related to an
investigation and remediation associated with the manufacture of products at one of our
businesses and an impairment charge related to intangible assets at this reporting unit.
Additionally, 2017 operating income and EBITDA benefited from insurance recoveries in
excessive storm losses related to Hurricane Irma. These items were partially offset by the
contribution to operating income and EBITDA from having a full year of operations from
Costa Farms in 2018.
Next, I'd like to briefly discuss the operating results from our program services division
and ILS investment management operations due to their increasing contributions to our
operating results. Our State National program services business, which we acquired in the
fourth quarter of 2017, added $96 million in operating revenue in 2018 compared to $15
million in operating revenue in 2017.

FINAL

ILS investment management operations, which consist of Markel CATCo and Nephila,
combined to report $92 million in operating revenue in 2018 compared to $29 million in
operating revenue in 2017. As a reminder, we closed in the Nephila acquisition in midNovember. The increase in our operating revenue is attributed to higher year-over-year
net assets under management at Markel CATCo and the Nephila acquisition in 2018.
Our ILS investment management operations are not included in a reportable segment,
but are captured as part of the $144 million loss from other within the components of
consolidated operating income for 2018. This loss is primarily due to certain adjustments
made during the fourth quarter of 2018 at our Markel CATCo operations, which I'll discuss
in more detail now.

Bloomberg Transcript

As previously announced, effective January 18, 2019, two senior executives of Markel
CATCo are no longer with the company. We had accrued $64 million of incentive and
retention compensation for the two individuals as of September 30, 2018, all of which was
reversed in the fourth quarter. Note, for the year, the reversal of this accrual in the fourth
quarter resulted in a $35 million reduction in services and other expenses in our
consolidated statement of loss and comprehensive loss for the full year of 2018.
During the fourth quarter of 2018, we also reduced the carrying value of the goodwill and
intangible assets of the Markel CATCo reporting unit to zero, which resulted in an
impairment charge of $179 million. In light of governmental inquiries into loss reserves
recorded in late 2017 and early 2018 at an entity managed by Markel CATCo, and taking
into consideration the departure of two senior executives and certain redemption rights
that are now being offered to investors in ILS Funds managed by Markel CATCo, Markel
CATCo's ability to maintain or raise capital has been adversely impacted. As a result, we
performed an assessment of the recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets at the
Markel CATCo reporting unit as of the end of the year and determined the impairment
charge was necessary.
Turning to our investment results, net investment income increased to $434 million in
2018 compared to $406 million in 2017. The increase was driven by higher short-term
investment income, primarily due to higher short-term interest rates and higher dividend
income due to increased equity holdings. Net investment losses included in our net loss
for 2018 were $438 million compared to $5 million in 2017. The loss in 2018 was primarily
due to a decrease in the fair value of equity securities during the year, attributed to the
unfavorable market value movements and a decline in the fair value of our investments in
the Markel CATCo ILS Funds.
We recorded net investment losses totaling $125 million for the year versus $52 million last
year related to our investments in the Markel CATCo managed ILS Funds. These losses
resulted from decreases in the fair value of the ILS Funds, which were driven by the losses
associated with the 2017 catastrophes.
As a reminder, effective January 1, 2018, all changes in the fair value of the equity portfolio
are included in net income rather than other comprehensive income. Net unrealized
investment gains decreased $300 million during 2018, reflecting a decrease in the fair

FINAL

value of our fixed maturity portfolio resulting from rising interest rates. Given our longterm focus, variability in the timing of investment gains and losses is to be expected.
Now, if we take a look at our total results for the year, our effective tax rates for both 2018
and 2017 are not meaningful due to a small pre-tax loss in 2018 and large non-recurring
items in both 2018 and 2017. So instead of talking about the tax rate, I'll focus my
comments today on the dollar impact of tax benefit and tax expense associated with
transactions that caused our overall tax expense to differ from that what you would
expect by applying the U.S. statutory tax rate to our pre-tax loss.
First, the impact of our decision to elect to treat two of our UK subsidiaries as U.S.
taxpayers beginning in 2018 resulted in a one-time deferred income tax charge of $103
million this year. Additionally, last year, we reported a one-time benefit of $340 million
related to the enactment of U.S. tax reform legislation in late 2017.
Excluding the 2018 non-recurring item, our income tax expense differs from that expected
by applying the 21% U.S. statutory tax rate to our pre-tax loss, primarily due to nondeductible losses related to our investments in Markel CATCo managed ILS Funds,
partially offset by the impact of tax-exempt investment income.

Bloomberg Transcript

We reported a net loss to shareholders of $128 million in 2018 compared to net income of
$395 million a year ago. Comprehensive loss to shareholders for 2018 was $376 million
compared to comprehensive income of $1.2 billion a year ago. Comprehensive income for
the year was driven by the net loss for the year, the components of which I just discussed,
along with a decline in the fair value of fixed maturity securities since the end of 2017.
I'll close my remarks this morning with a few comments on cash flows, capital and our
balance sheet. Net cash provided by operating activities was $893 million for 2018
compared to $859 million in 2017. Operating cash flows for 2018 reflected higher net
premium collections, lower payments for employee profit sharing compared to 2017. 2018
also included higher claims payments, driven in part by the impact of the 2017 and 2018
catastrophe losses.
As we previously disclosed, we completed two acquisitions in the fourth quarter, adding
Brahmin Leather Works to our Markel Ventures operations and Nephila Holdings to our ILS
management operations. Both of these deals were funded from cash on hand. Even after
considering the funds used for these acquisitions, we held $2.6 billion of invested assets
at the holding company at December 31, 2018, compared to $2.7 billion at the end of last
year. Total shareholders' equity stood at $9.1 billion at the end of 2018, a decrease of 4%
from 2017.
And now, I'll turn it over to Richie to talk more about our underwriting results.

Richard R. Whitt, III

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Thanks, Jeremy. Good morning, everybody. Today, I'll focus my comments on our
underwriting operations and I'll also provide a brief update on our State National

FINAL

operations and ILS investment management operations.
So, first, I'll start with the insurance segment. Gross written premiums for the quarter are
up $153 million or 15% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. On a year-to-date basis,
writings are up $608 million or 15%. Our recently acquired Markel Surety and the State
National collateral protection product line added $23 million in additional premiums in the
quarter and $194 million in premiums on a year-to-date basis. Our premium growth for
both the quarter and on a year-to-date basis, excluding these two new product lines, was
driven by organic growth in our general liability, professional liability, and personal line
products.
Earned premiums for this segment are up 10% for the quarter and 14% on a year-to-date
basis due to similar reasons as the gross written premium increases. The combined ratio
for the insurance segment was 99% in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 88% for
the same period a year ago. The 11 point increase in the combined ratio was largely driven
by more cat events during the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the same period last
year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Cat losses added 7 points to our 2018 quarter-to-date combined ratio compared to 1
point in 2017. The remaining increase in the quarter-to-date combined ratio was due to
decreases in favorable development on prior accident years' losses, along with the
impact of higher earned premiums on the prior accident year loss ratio.
The year-to-date combined ratio for the insurance segment was 94% versus 97% last
year. The 3 point decrease in the combined ratio was largely driven by lower losses from
cat events in 2018 compared to 2017. Cat events added 3 points to the 2018 year-to-date
combined ratio compared to 8 points in 2017. The remaining change in the combined ratio
was due to the unfavorable impact of growth in earned premiums on our prior years' loss
ratio.
Next, I'll discuss the results of the reinsurance segment. Gross written premiums for the
quarter are up $29 million or 34% compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. On a year-todate basis, writings are down $61 million or 6%. The increase in gross written premiums
for the fourth quarter of 2018 was driven by higher premium volumes in our general
liability and professional liability product lines due to favorable premium adjustments, new
deals and renewal increases.
The decrease in gross written premiums on a year-to-date basis was driven by a large
specialty quota share treaty, which we entered into during the first quarter of 2017 that did
not renew in 2018, along with a decrease in our property lines due primarily to nonrenewals. These decreases were partially offset by growth in our surety product line, as
well as higher premium – gross written premium volume in our general liability,
professional liability and workers' compensation product lines due to favorable premium
adjustments and timing of renewals.
We have non-renewed marginal property business where rates and/or terms did not
improve sufficiently to meet our profitability target. As mentioned previously, significant

FINAL

volatility in gross premium volume can be expected in our reinsurance segment due to
individually significant deals and timing of renewals on multi-year contracts. Earned
premiums for this segment increased by 3% for the quarter and decreased by 1% on the
year-to-date basis for the same reasons mentioned for written premiums.
The combined ratio for the reinsurance segment was 151% in the fourth quarter of 2018
compared to 122% for the same period a year ago. The 29% increase in the combined
ratio was largely driven by higher losses from cat events in 2018 compared to 2017, and a
slightly higher expense ratio. Cat events added 63 points to the fourth quarter 2018
combined ratio compared to 25 points in 2017. The increases in losses from cat events
was partially offset by a lower attritional loss ratio due to lower losses in our general
liability products lines, as well as more favorable development on prior year loss reserves
in our medical malpractice product line.
The year-to-date combined ratio for the reinsurance segment was 113% compared to
132% last year. The 19 point decrease in the combined ratio was primarily driven by lower
losses from cat events compared to 2017. Cat events added 19 points to the year-to-date
2018 combined ratio compared to 32 points last year.

Bloomberg Transcript

The reinsurance segment's 2017 results included $85 or 9 points on a year-to-date basis
of adverse development on prior year loss reserves due to the decrease in the Ogden
Rate. Excluding the impact of Ogden, this segment had less favorable development in
2018 compared to 2017 due to less favorable development in our property reinsurance
lines, inclusive of some adverse development in 2018 related to the 2017 cat events.
Next, I'll make a few comments about State National. Just as a reminder, the State
National business is comprised of two primary products, a collateral protection insurance
coverage, results from which are included in our insurance segment, and a fronting
platform, which provides insurance licenses, rated paper and services for a fee. We refer
to this business as our program services business.
The program services business is almost entirely non-risk bearing to Markel, and is
reported separately from our underwriting operations. The program services business
added $488 million in the quarter and $2.1 billion for the year in gross written premium,
which is almost entirely ceded. The business is a fee business and contributed ceding
commission fee revenue of $28 million in the quarter and $96 million for the year. These
amounts are reported in services and other revenues within our operating results. We're
very pleased with State National results for their first full year as part of Markel.
Now, moving to insurance-linked security investment management operations, with the
completion of the Nephila acquisition in November of 2018, we have significantly
increased our ILS investment management operations. With Nephila and Markel CATCo,
we have approximately $14.5 billion of net assets under management at the end of 2018
compared to about $3 billion of net assets under management at the end of 2017.
Starting with our acquisition of CATCo in 2015, State National in 2017 and, most recently,
the Nephila acquisition in 2018, we've been working very hard to build our capabilities in
Page 7 of 21

Date: 2019-02-06

FINAL

the insurance-linked securities and program service area. We see significant synergies
possible between our insurance, reinsurance, ILS and program services businesses.
In a recent Aon publication, they stated that 2017 and 2018 were the costliest back to back
catastrophe years on record, with insured losses approaching $240 billion. This level of
loss activity was an extreme challenge for the ILS market in general and for Markel
CATCo, in particular. Not only did Markel CATCo funds incur significant losses in 2017 and
2018, but their initial estimates for 2017 losses were too low.
As we announced in early December, we received inquiries by U.S. and Bermuda
authorities into the loss reserves recorded in late 2017 and 2018 at an entity managed by
Markel CATCo. We're cooperating fully with these regulators. We continue to investigate
these issues and have retained outside counsel to conduct an internal review. The internal
review is ongoing and no conclusions have been reached.

Bloomberg Transcript

As previously announced, we have installed new management and oversight at Markel
CATCo and are providing additional resources as needed. We expect to learn from the
cat events of 2017 and 2018, and we plan to adapt our Markel CATCo strategy
accordingly. We remain confident in the future of ILS and we believe ILS will be a valuable
important component of Markel's overall strategy in the future.
I'll finish up with some market commentary. I would sum up market conditions at the end
of 2018 as more good than bad news. We saw continued modest improvement in most
insurance pricing during 2018. In fact, December rate increases were our strongest of the
year. So that's the good news. And I view it as very good news, considering that over 80%
of our risk-bearing premiums come from insurance lines.
The bad news was that property reinsurance rates continued to disappoint at the
important January 1 renewals. Property reinsurance rates were inexplicably flat after a twoyear period of record catastrophe losses. We continue to push for rate increases where
needed and shed reinsurance business at January 1 that did not meet our profitability
requirements.
I will say that our hope is not lost as the Japanese and Florida market renewals would take
place in the second quarter of 2019. Both markets have handed reinsurers significant
losses over the last two years and should rightfully be in payback mode. Our expectations
are that rates should be up meaningly for these renewals. However, if they're not, we will
be reducing our writings accordingly.
I want to thank you for your time today, and now, I'm going to turn it over to Tom.

Thomas Sinnickson Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Thank you, Richie. As Jeremy reported earlier, we experienced a negative total return on
our investment portfolio of 1% during 2018. Our equities declined 3.5% for the year and
we made 1.3% on our fixed income holdings.

FINAL

Just to start to lengthen out the time horizon a bit and in keeping with our normal pattern
of looking at results over five-year periods, here are the five-year numbers. In our equity
portfolio, we earned 9.7% per year over the last five years, and in our fixed income
operations we earned 3% per year. I'm pleased with these results. Over 1 and 5 and 10
and now 30 years, we've exceeded the returns of the S&P 500 by over 100 basis points. I
will happily sign up for those sorts of results for the next 30 years in a New York minute.
Obviously, I'm not thrilled to report negative returns to you for 2018, but I do see them as
reflecting normal and expected volatility that is the very warp and woof of financial
markets. Fortunately, this is nothing new for us. We've navigated through financial markets
for decades with a straightforward and consistent discipline throughout.

Bloomberg Transcript

In 2018, we stuck to our longstanding four-part discipline of looking for: one, profitable
businesses with good returns on capital, and not too much leverage; with two,
management teams with equal measures of talent and integrity; with three, reinvestment
opportunities in capital discipline; at, four, reasonable prices.
At any given point in the investment business, a true professional looks either dumber or
smarter than they really are. In 2018, that discipline produced a return of negative 3.5%.
While that is better than the S&P return, it remains a negative return. We'll put 2018 in the
category of times when we look dumber than we really are. By contrast, in 2017, we
earned 25.5% on our equity holdings, an amount also greater than the S&P 500 returns of
that year. We'll put 2017 in the category of times when we look smarter than we really are.
Over time, the true level of intelligence or skill of an investment discipline reveals itself.
And as I said earlier, we've outperformed the S&P 500 in fixed income alternatives for
decades, the process works.
In our Markel Ventures operations, we reported revenues of $1.9 billion versus $1.3 billion a
year ago. We also reported EBITDA of $170 million compared to $188 million a year ago.
On the surface, this doesn't jump off the page as a spectacular result, but I'd like to
suggest it is meaningfully better than what it looks like at first glance.
First, in 2017, EBITDA benefited from certain insurance recoveries related to Hurricane
Irma, which pulled some earnings into the 2017 number a bit ahead of what would have
occurred otherwise. In 2018, the effects of purchase accounting and first full year
ownership circumstances, which include tax adjustments, the payment of better-thanexpected earnouts and certain one-time charges at other Markel Ventures units, all went
through the 2018 EBITDA calculation.
I've spoken in the past of my expectations that the Markel Ventures portfolio would
normally produce EBITDA margins in the low to mid-teens. In 2019, if our operations
perform at the same level they did in 2018 economically, we will earn and report EBITDA
in that range since we'll have burned off a good chunk of purchase accounting related
charges by that point.
One other data point that might be helpful is also to view Markel Ventures in a similar fiveyear time period as we do throughout Markel. Almost each and every year, I find myself

FINAL

writing in the annual report or speaking in these conference calls about accounting and
how it is important to sort and sift through the first pass of presentation to gain more
understanding about the underlying economic performance of Markel Ventures. The good
news is that we're long term around here, and in the long term, the effects of purchase
accounting diminish over time and burn off. On a completely unadjusted, no comment, no
color commentary basis, five years ago, Markel Ventures reported revenues of $683
million and EBITDA of $77 million.
In 2018, we reported revenues of $1.9 billion and EBITDA of $170 million. Have we made
some mistakes along the way? Are there things we need to get better at? The answer is
absolutely yes. We're making mistakes and we're learning. And in aggregate, the results
indicate that the process at Markel Ventures is working.

Bloomberg Transcript

We follow the same discipline at Markel Ventures as we do in our equity process. We look
for profitable businesses with good returns on capital and not too much leverage, with
management teams with equal measures of talent and integrity, with reinvestment
opportunities in capital discipline at reasonable prices. Just as with the case with our
equity results, the long-term record of this approach has created immense value for
Markel over time. Just as is the case with our equity results, it does not happen in a
straight line or in smooth year-by-year progressions.
The five-year view of our insurance, investment and ventures operations begins to set
things at the same focal point as the one we use to run the business. We hope you're
pleased with the five-year results, understanding of the year-to-year variability and
volatility, and as excited and as enthusiastic as we are to apply what we've learned for the
next five years.
Thank you for your interest and partnership. And with that, we look forward to your
questions.

FINAL

Could you talk about the redemption rights? You mentioned that there's a opportunity for
investors in the ILS Funds to presumably redeem some capital. Where are we in that
process? How much is exposed to that process? And at this point, does it impact your
own capital?

A - Richard R. Whitt, III

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Okay, Mark. This is Richie. Yes, given those circumstances at Markel CATCo, we felt it was
appropriate to offer investors a special redemption right, which they can exercise by
March 31. The likelihood is most of the investors will wait until March or close to March 31
to exercise their option. And my expectation is, just given the uncertainty that we
mentioned in terms of the decisions we made around accounting, I would expect most
investors to exercise their option, that we've given them, at March 31. But we'll obviously –
we're in contact with the investors, we're talking to them. We're providing them updates
and we'll see what they decide to do. In terms of impact to Markel's capital, no impact to
Markel's capital. Obviously, if investors redeem, what we're able to do in terms of
investing for the 2020 year would be impacted by their decisions.

Q - Mark Hughes

{BIO 1506147 <GO>}

And then, is there a magnitude – it sounds like you think most will exercise. How many
potentially could exercise or how much capital is involved?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Richard R. Whitt, III

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

It's everything in the private fund. The public fund board needs to take its own decisions in
terms of what they want to do in terms of the public fund. But it would be all the capital in
the private fund, which is roughly, what, 85% of – I don't have an exact number, but it's a
significant amount of the capital.
If I put myself in the shoes of investors, they've received an option. There is quite a bit of
uncertainty. They have the ability later in the year, if the uncertainty is resolved, to come
back in, if they'd like. So, that would be my expectation.

Q - Mark Hughes

{BIO 1506147 <GO>}

And then of the $14.5 billion, how much of that was Nephila?

A - Richard R. Whitt, III

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

About $11.5 billion, roughly.

Q - Mark Hughes

{BIO 1506147 <GO>}

So, if I'm thinking about it properly, the majority of the balance would be open to
redemption, is that right?

FINAL

Q - Mark Hughes

{BIO 1506147 <GO>}

Okay. Just more of a small-bore question, but professional liability, I think you talked about
growth there in the – maybe both reinsurance and in the insurance segments. Anything
there that is catching your eye, any dislocation in that market, I'm thinking medical
professional, in particular.

A - Richard R. Whitt, III

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Medical professional continues to be challenging, probably amongst the professional lines
that's still one of the more challenging areas. I think it's – I think what we're seeing
primarily is, I mentioned sort of modest rate increases, we're starting to – or we saw
throughout 2018 modest rate increases in professional. We're a big writer of professional,
both insurance and reinsurance. And I think relative to other areas that we could deploy
capital and write business, we think professional is becoming more attractive. So – and
nothing really kind of stands out to me in particular, just kind of a gradual improvement
that we've seen in the pricing environment and the risk reward around professional
business.

Q - Mark Hughes

{BIO 1506147 <GO>}

Within that, medical professional is a laggard, perhaps.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Richard R. Whitt, III

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

I'm sorry, say that again.

Q - Mark Hughes

{BIO 1506147 <GO>}

I said within that, looking at professional liability, would you say medical professional, I
used the word laggard, but still one of the more challenging areas I think was what you
said?

A - Richard R. Whitt, III

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Yeah, yeah, I think it is. I mean, that's an area that's been over time really good to us, but
it has – it's been very competitive in the last few years. And for whatever reason, it has
been slower to react to the losses that have been incurred over the last few years and I
would – yeah, I'd say that pricing movement has lagged some of the other professional
lines.

Q - Jeff Schmitt

{BIO 19747235 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning, everyone. Could you discuss maybe just kind of broadly what you're
seeing for commercial loss trends in the U.S.?

FINAL

A - Richard R. Whitt, III

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Well, loss trends, I mean, we are – we stay wary of inflation and in particular when it comes
to insurance claims inflation. For quite a while, inflation has been pretty tame, it's been
under control. And as a result of that, claims inflation has also been fairly tame and under
control. And I think the entire industry has really benefited from that.
We continue to remain wary of that. And I do think we are starting to see some signs of
claim trend ticking up. And I think we've seen some signs of severity of losses ticking up.
Now, that can be inflation or socioeconomic issues, legal issues, but I think we're seeing
some tick up in both of those and we're trying to build that into the pricing that we think
we need to hit our return goals on those products.

Q - Jeff Schmitt

{BIO 19747235 <GO>}

Okay. And just thinking about AIG and Lloyd's kind of pulling back in E&S space, can you
maybe discuss what you're seeing there, where there is opportunities for Markel?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Richard R. Whitt, III

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Well, E&S is an area that actually – I mean that's kind of really where Markel started, cut its
teeth, and it's still a very big part of our business. So, the E&S wholesale market has been
a really good market for us the last few years. We grew nicely in 2017, and then on top,
again, in 2018, off of that already nice growth that we saw in 2017. So that's been a real
positive I think in terms of our businesses the last couple of years.
Now, whether that's a result of whatever AIG is doing or the things they're doing at
Lloyd's to address the lower performing lines, I'm sure that has some impact, but that's
probably not all of it. Certainly, some of the factors, but not the only factors.

description of the tax rate of the last two years. Do we have an estimate of what it will be
going forward?

FINAL

A - Jeremy A. Noble

{BIO 20687803 <GO>}

Yeah. John, thanks for the question. If you think about, to the extent you can think about
and predict kind of normalized amount of pre-tax income, think about taking the U.S.
statutory tax rate and that we would come in slightly lower than that predominantly
because it's sort of tax-exempt investment income. I caution you because as we talked
about, that variability particularly marking to market equities through our pre-tax income
can create some variability with the extent to which those permanent differences like taxexempt investment income move the rate. But generally, what you haven't seen in the last
couple of years, we should come in slightly lower than the U.S. statutory tax rate.

Q - John D. Fox

{BIO 1796608 <GO>}

Okay, great. And then in the investment management business, you had revenue in the
quarter of $39 million and then I thought I heard you say because it had accrual at CATCo,
there's a $35 million reduction of expenses in the quarter?

A - Jeremy A. Noble

{BIO 20687803 <GO>}

Actually, year-to-date benefit would be about $35 million reduction; in the quarter, that
amount was $65 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - John D. Fox

{BIO 1796608 <GO>}

Got it. Okay. Thank you for that. And should we think about that line item growing as the
asset balance has gone from $3 billion to $14 billion? Is that like a traditional asset
management business where there is a fee income in the revenue part and then
whatever the margin as it falls out, is that the right way to think about it?

A - Jeremy A. Noble

{BIO 20687803 <GO>}

I think so, John, yup.

Q - John D. Fox

{BIO 1796608 <GO>}

Okay. And then Richie, expanding on CATCo, I mean, what are the risks to book value
going forward? I mean, you did take a goodwill charge. I mean, if there's an awful scenario
here in CATCo, let's say, just kind of goes out of business, is there a potential for further
goodwill? And then I think you have $58 million invested in the funds. That obviously could
make money or go down. So can you just kind of going forward put some size on the risk
in CATCo at this point?

A - Richard R. Whitt, III

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Sure. Well, I think you did a good job of it, John. Obviously, at this point, we've written off
all the goodwill and intangibles related to CATCo. So if we get to the other side of the
challenges we currently face and we don't have – we're not able to continue the business,
there's no more goodwill or intangible hits to tag.

Q - John D. Fox

{BIO 1796608 <GO>}

terms of cat activity. But – and then there is obviously ongoing cost to the business on a
reduced asset base, we'll see how that works out. And then legal contingencies, we'll
have to see how those things play out.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - John D. Fox

{BIO 1796608 <GO>}

Right, sure. Okay. And then my last question is more of a strategic one for you and Tom.
I'll use Tom's five-year long-term timeframe, which the reinsurance business is writing
close to a $200 million underwriting loss and Richie, you gave an excellent description of
the market where we had two back to back record cat years, but really very little increase
in rate in the marketplace for a variety of reasons. So strategically, is this a business that
you like less, you like more, where does it fit in? And given the expansion also in ILS
market, is it a business where you can make a Markel-type return and how're you thinking
about that?

A - Richard R. Whitt, III

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Sure. There's a lot to unwrap there, John.

Q - John D. Fox

{BIO 1796608 <GO>}

There is.

A - Richard R. Whitt, III

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

The first thing I'd say is, if 2017, 2018 level of catastrophe activity were to continue,
nobody's business model works that writes property, just...

Q - John D. Fox

{BIO 1796608 <GO>}

Right.

A - Richard R. Whitt, III

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

...period end of statement. Everything's going to have to change if that level of activity
continues. We found ourselves in this place once before not that long ago after 2004 and
2005 when we had multiple events in back to back years. Katrina, Rita, Wilma in the 2005
year and we were all asking the same questions. And so, the question is going to be,
Page 15 of 21



Company N ame: M arkel Corp
Company Ticker: M K L US Equity
Date: 2019-02-06

FINAL

where – does this level continue, do we end up somewhere in between, do we go back
to the old way, you'd go a number of years of light cat activity. Nobody can answer that.
And you've got the additional question of global warming or climate change or whatever
you want to call it.
The bottom line is over the last two years as we've seen what's happened, we've been
reducing our property writings. We're writing less property today than we were at the
beginning of 2017. We're going to probably write less property in 2019 if pricing doesn't
get better quickly. So, we and everybody else will continue to back away from property
risk unless the risk reward equation gets back into an appropriate balance. So we're not
going to kneejerk, we're going to adjust as we always do sort of gradually, but we're not
going to knowingly continue to take losses on a product line.

Q - Will Allen

{BIO 17711795 <GO>}

Hi, guys. Thank you very much for your time. I just had some questions regarding Nephila,
particularly if you could help me on the performance in 2018. You just mentioned that they
have $11.5 billion of AUM currently. I believe that's down from the $12.3 billion at closing,
and then also I think they've peaked at $12.5 billion in August. So can you just explain the
decline in $1 billion of AUM there? Could you also talk about whether they – how their
performance was and whether there was any Irma loss deterioration and how you think of
that in the context of what happened to CATCo?

A - Richard R. Whitt, III

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

Sure.

Q - Will Allen

{BIO 17711795 <GO>}

FINAL

I have a few other questions relating to Nephila, but let's start there.

A - Richard R. Whitt, III

{BIO 7084125 <GO>}

All right. All right, let's start there. Thanks, Will. First of all, it's probably good to understand
Nephila is in a very different space to CATCo in the ILS market. CATCo is a very niche
business, writing retro and not only writing retro, but writing a very specific product, a
tailored product. So they're in the retro space of the ILS market.

Bloomberg Transcript

Nephila is in the reinsurance space. They write virtually no retro and they're writing more –
all the time, they're writing more insurance. So, they're a reinsurance and insurance
business, whereas CATCo was a retro business. The decrease in AUM is going to be
largely due to losses in 2018. The redemption activity was not out of the ordinary. There
were also people coming into the funds. So, I don't know the exact number or the exact
net, whether it was a net redemption or a net increase, but it was relatively modest. Most
of that reduction in AUM or NAV is going to be due to losses in 2018. Because they write
reinsurance and insurance and they're closer to the risk, their losses were smaller than
CATCo and also more predictable. So, I don't think they've had the same issues with loss
creep that CATCo had.
All reinsurers had creep issues with Irma and some of the other storms, certainly not to
the extent that CATCo saw. And they had small losses for 2018, but I would say within
expectations given the type of year that 2018 and 2017 were. So, they fared – and they
did a good job. Frank, Greg and that team, I truly believe they are the best in the business.
And they've been doing it for 20 years. And that experience and knowledge of ILS has
really shown through in terms of their performance in 2017 and 2018. They'll be the first to
tell you, it's not what they want to do. They want to produce for their investors. But I think,
given all the challenges of 2017 and 2018, they came through it very well.

Q - Will Allen

{BIO 17711795 <GO>}

Thank you. Just linked to that, I guess, and I guess linked to CATCo, but could give us an
assessment of how to think about the goodwill that you've paid for Nephila. Obviously
KKR and Man Group did very well on their investments, but obviously during that period,
they had good results and increased their AUM significantly. And then as moderately
linked to that the one thing I was surprised by in the results last night was actually the
amount of compensation that the individuals at CATCo had been receiving. Can you give
us an idea of how much of the economics of Nephila were recurring to the team there
versus shareholders?

A - Thomas Sinnickson Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

Sure. I'll do my best. In terms how to think about the goodwill on Nephila, I mean we were
basically behind the future stream of operating cash flows. So, Nephila is a fee business.

Company N ame: M arkel Corp
Company Ticker: M K L US Equity

FINAL

It's an asset manager and you think of it – in terms of thinking about it, I think you think
about it in terms of a multiple of EBITDAs, which you're willing to pay for that future
stream of cash flows. I think we paid a fair multiple of the future – of what we think the
future stream of cash flows will be to the selling shareholders. There is no question ILS
has now been challenged two years in a row. Everybody was questioning the resiliency of
the ILS market after 2017 and then 2018 is another bad year, and so additional questions
come about.
I am not so much concerned about 2019 or 2020 in terms of ILS. We are thinking much
more about the next 5 and the next 10 years, and that's how we think about the goodwill
that we paid for Nephila when we bought it. We're thinking about the next 10 and 20
years and what that looks like, and we think it's a very bright future for ILS.

Bloomberg Transcript

Going to your compensation question, in the CATCo deal, we deferred a significant
portion of the proceeds for the deal over the next three to five years. And so, that is why
– it was about a third of the proceed – or third of the value of the deal was deferred in the
CATCo deal. And so, that's why that number is so large. It is because of roughly a third of
the purchase price was deferred, and it was divided between performance and, basically,
stay bonuses. So, that's the reason there. We took a different approach with Nephila, and
a big chunk of it was not deferred, but to achieve alignment with investors. The selling
management, Frank, Greg and team, took a big chunk of their proceeds and invested
them side-by-side with the investors in the Nephila funds. And they wanted to do that to
show alignment and support of the investors in Nephila. And we were very glad that they
wanted to do that. And so, we agreed that a big chunk of their proceeds now sits in the
funds alongside the investors.

Q - Scott Heleniak

{BIO 15171212 <GO>}

Hi, thanks. Good morning. Just the reinsurance growth was really strong this quarter and I
know you mentioned it was professional and general liability. Just wondering if that was –
was that driven by a large treaty or two or did you see that kind of across the board? And
do you still expect to see sort of pockets of growth in reinsurance in those liability lines
this year even if pricing doesn't – yeah, doesn't improve a whole lot? And just on the
liability side. I know property is obviously a different story.

FINAL

Company N ame: M arkel Corp
Company Ticker: M K L US Equity
Date: 2019-02-06

Yeah. Nothing sticks out to me. I'll be honest. Like, we try to always caution, timing can –
these are big contracts in relationship to the size of the overall portfolio. So, it doesn't – it
only takes one – or the timing on one contract to slip or speed up and all of a sudden
you're talking about big increases or decreases quarter to quarter. We are clearly focusing
more on professional and liability, because, as I think I said earlier, we see rates moving in
a positive direction on those two lines. And we view the relative pricing adequacy of those
as being better than what we're seeing in property and some other areas. So we
definitely are more interested in those areas. But I don't – if we don't see continued
progress in terms of rate, we're not going to put our foot to the gas on casualty or
professional. I just think relative to other areas they look a little more attractive to us right
now, but it's not a let's go out and write all we can. There's still some work to be done in
professional and casualty.

Q - Scott Heleniak

{BIO 15171212 <GO>}

Okay. And then on the property side what kind of rate increases would you want to see
to, I guess, get more interested in some of that property business at 4/1 and 6/1
(00:57:06). Obviously flat's not good enough but even low-single digit seems like not
much of a help. Would you want to see 5% to 10% rate increases or what are your
thoughts on how much pricing has to move to become more interested?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Thomas Sinnickson Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

I'm probably not the expert there. I'd want to leave that to my – to Jed Rhoads and the
guys who run our reinsurance operations. If I had to guess what they would tell you, is it
would depend on the scene and I don't think single digits gets it done. I think teens is
probably needed for people who have had relatively decent performance and something
much better than teens is probably needed for people who really need to pay back
losses that they've handed to us over the last couple of years. So – but to get more
specific on that I think I'd have to ask the team to get involved. There's probably a little
more art – there's art and science in that I guess I'd say.

Q - Scott Heleniak

{BIO 15171212 <GO>}

No, that's helpful answer. Appreciate that. And then I guess the last question. I don't know
if you gave this out, but how much of the one-time costs that you had from CATCo
investigation that were in expenses and anything else unusual impacted the expense ratio
in the quarter?

A - Jeremy A. Noble

{BIO 20687803 <GO>}

Yeah, Scott, It's Jeremy. We didn't disclose any figure with regards to those ongoing
expenses, but they are not significant in the period and really nothing else you will have
seen in the expense ratio. It's pretty consistent period-on-period across the piece. So,
there's not much to sort of point to there.

Hi. Yeah, just wanted to follow up real quick on CATCo. Does Markel have to reinsure any
CATCo's losses if investors redeem? I mean could you be on the hook for anything there?

A - Thomas Sinnickson Gayner

{BIO 1896932 <GO>}

We do not reinsure CATCo. CATCo purchases some protections on their own and
obviously those would be available to the extent they're triggered, but Markel did not
provide any reinsurance to Markel CATCo funds.
