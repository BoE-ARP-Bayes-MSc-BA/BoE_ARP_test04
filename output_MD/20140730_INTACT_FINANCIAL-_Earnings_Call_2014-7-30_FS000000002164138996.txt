{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

All right. Thanks, Dennis, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we announced the
second quarter net operating income of $206 million or $1.53 per share, much improved
from the levels we've recorded in recent quarters. Improvement was driven by our
underwriting performance with particular strength in personal lines and commercial auto.
Overall, our 92.9% combined ratio was closed to 5 points better than a year ago.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our solid underwriting performance was complemented by strong investment returns
leading to growth in book value per share of almost 10% from a year ago. We reported an
operating ROE of 11.6% despite the heavy cat burden in the second half of 2013. More
recently, the annualized operating ROE for the ﬁrst half of the year is closed to 15% aided
by our property improvement initiatives, which helped deliver a year-to-date combined
ratio of 92.6% in that line of business.
In property, we've talked about being an early mover with our 10-point improvement
initiative. I'd say that the industry is catching up as market conditions have continued to
ﬁrm and our relative position has improved. Units were down 1% in the quarter in that line
of business, improved from being down 2% in recent quarters despite now reﬂecting our
full product changes and rate actions. Though more time is required for our results to fully
reﬂect our corrective actions, year-to-date, we've shown a 2-point improvement in our
underlying loss ratio in our property business.
We maintain our positive view towards personal auto, a line of business that generated a
combined ratio of 91.5% in the second quarter. Overall, we're operating in an environment
where both competitors and regulators behave fairly rationally, and costs have been
generally stable in the recent past.
In Ontario, the government's auto insurance costs and rate reduction strategy has so far
led to a reduction in ﬁled rates of 5.4% across the market as a whole. Our process of
reducing rates to customers by 5.3% on average began in early April. We believe the
newly elected liberal maturity government fully understands that further rate reductions
can only come in conjunction with meaningful cost reduction measures. To this end, we're
encouraged by the introduction of Bill 15, which is a combination of two pieces of
legislation that had been impacted by the dissolution of parliament in the spring.
In the current environment, due to the cost reduction measures already implemented and
our own proactive actions. We're comfortable with our margins in this market and we'll
continue to pursue growth opportunities. While commercial auto delivered the very

FINAL

strong underwriting performance in the quarter, our commercial P&C business reported a
combined ratio of 100.5%. Clearly, we're disappointed by these results and we're taking
action.
Earlier this month, we implemented a new pricing algorithm with which we'll continue to
push through even more targeted rate increases. We've also geo-mapped our risk to
better highlight potential concentration issues. I expect these actions should enable this
line of business to generate a combined ratio in the low 90%s.
When it comes to our outlook for the industry, we foresee low single-digit growth in
personal auto and commercial lines, but upper single-digit growth in personal property.
We continue to expect the current hard market conditions in personal property to
accelerate for the foreseeable future. While we did not see signiﬁcant acceleration in the
ﬁrst half of the year, the commercial P&C market has shown signs of ﬁrming in the past
year. Renewal rates across the portfolio for us were up by close to 5% in the second
quarter roughly double the pace from a year ago.

Bloomberg Transcript

The low interest rate environment and elevated losses from catastrophes should support
our growth outlook. From a proﬁtability perspective, we expect the industry's combined
ratio to improve in 2014, given the unprecedented level of cats seen in 2013. Overall, we
expect the industry's ROE to trend back towards its long-term average of 10% this year.
Looking speciﬁcally at Intact Financial, we believe we will outperform the industry's ROE
by at least 500 basis points aided by our strong relative performance in Q1 with a
combined ratio six points better than the industry.
As we've discussed in the past, our objective is to leverage this outperformance by
reinvesting our excess capital into growth initiatives. At the end of June, our ﬁnancial
position was strong with more than $650 million of excess capital. Our view towards
capital deployment has not changed. Clearly, our focus has been and remains on ﬁnding
actionable manufacturing or distribution opportunities right here in Canada.
In fact, during the ﬁrst six months of the year, we invested more than $160 million into our
distribution activities. BrokerLink for example has grown its premiums from $625 million at
the end of 2013 to $830 million today, well on its way to reach the $1 billion level we spoke
about a few years back at Investors Day. Beneﬁts from these investments are starting to
become meaningful in our results as distribution income reached $30 million in the
quarter.
I've also spoken many times about our planning for future growth. A portion of which we
expect will come from abroad. It's in this context that we made a small investment during
the quarter in an online insurance broker in Brazil. While we're still continuing to explore
various opportunities around the world, we've decided to invest in distribution in Brazil,
where we can leverage both our data analytics as well as technology skills. This
investment is consistent with our strategy to expand beyond Canada in a prudent manner
and build an organic pipeline with meaningful impact over time.

In conclusion, we remain energized by our prospects for the remainder of 2014 and
beyond, and believe that the disciplined approach in operating our business will continue
to serve us well. I'm conﬁdent that we're well positioned in the current environment aided
by a strong capital position, which enables us to execute upon opportunities for proﬁtable
growth.

FINAL

I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Louis Marcotte.

Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Thanks, Charles. Today, we reported our highest quarterly net operating income per share
to-date of $1.53 per share, up from $0.89 last year. The improvement year-over-year was
driven by solid operating results, including $110 million fewer catastrophe losses,
compared to the second quarter of last year. The actions we took in the personal property
line of business, in response to the severe weather continue to bear fruit and helped drive
a combined ratio of 93.5% this quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

Lower catastrophe losses in the quarter were oﬀset in part by storms in June that did not
reach our cat threshold of $7.5 million. The continued severe weather has been supportive
of hard market conditions, such that despite our rate and product changes, retention to
date has been better than expected, helping drive underlying growth of 6% in the
personal property line of business.
In personal auto, continued growth in our direct-to-consumer business and rate increases
in Alberta were more than oﬀset by the impact of government-mandated rate reductions
in Ontario. Our combined ratio remains healthy at 91.5%, despite lower favorable prior
year's claims development attributable mainly to risk-sharing pools and to quarterly
ﬂuctuations.
The commercial auto line of business continues to deliver excellent underwriting results,
with a combined ratio of 79.5%, 10 points better than last year, aided by higher favorable
prior year claims development and lower claims frequency. Commercial auto premiums
were up 3% from a year ago, despite competitive market conditions.
On the commercial P&C side as Charles said, we are taking corrective actions as this line
of business delivered a combined ratio of 100.5%, 8 points better than Q2 2013 on lower
catastrophe losses, which were partially oﬀset by higher claims severity.
Premiums in commercial P&C grew 2% in Q2 2014, despite our actions to reduce
earthquake exposure and improved proﬁtability in the worst-performing segments of our
portfolio. Next quarter will be our ﬁnal quarter under the earthquake reduction program.
Our expense ratio improved half a point from Q2 2013 to 31.3% driven by lower general
expenses and reinstatement premiums in Q2 2014, oﬀset by higher variable commissions.
Our eﬀective income tax rate of 14.7% beneﬁted by 5 points from the settlement of an old
tax ﬁle.

FINAL

Net investment income of $105 million in the second quarter of 2014 was up 3% from a
year ago as higher investments more than oﬀset the small decline in yields. We expect net
investment income in the second half of the year to be similar to the level reported in the
ﬁrst half of the year. We now have 5% of our portfolio in U.S. bonds and equities in order
to provide geographic and sector diversiﬁcation.
We remained in a strong ﬁnancial position at quarter end with an estimated MCT of 208%,
$657 million in excess capital, and debt-to-total-capital ratio of 17.8%. Book value per share
grew 4.3% quarter-over-quarter to $36.29 driven by solid earnings and the positive impact
from capital market strength.
Our results this quarter, again, demonstrate that we have both the expertise and balance
sheet strength to build for growth. We are pleased with the performance of the home
improvement plan, both from the top- and bottom-line perspective, and are taking
corrective actions in our commercial P&C business with similar discipline.
This quarter, we have taken a ﬁrst and prudent step towards gaining expertise in an
international market through our investment in Brazil. But we continue to focus our growth
ambitions, ﬁrst and foremost, on the domestic market.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Dennis.

Thanks, Louis. Jeremy, we are now ready to take questions.

Q&A
Operator
And your ﬁrst question comes from the line of Geoﬀ Kwan with RBC Capital Markets. Your
line is open.

Q - Geoﬀrey Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. First question I had was just on M&A. I know you talked a little bit
about the Brazil opportunity, as well as on the distribution side. I just wanted to get a
sense from the Canadian, if I just focus on Canada ﬁrst – on the manufacturing side, how
that market is? Has it changed at all in the past quarter or two? Then also with respect to
Brazil, obviously it is a small investment at the moment. But just kind of what – the thought
process in terms of how you build this out going forward?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Thanks, Geoﬀ. I think from a manufacturing point of view in Canada, our perspective has
not changed. We think they'll be 15 points, 15 to 20 points of market share that will
change hands, probably within ﬁve years. We think it's not going to be back-ended, it's

Page 5 of 21

Date: 2014-07-30

FINAL

likely to be front-ended. And the catalysts for change really have not changed in that
regard, so we see this clearly as the main area to deploy our excess capital in the near to
mid-term, and that's right up there, on the list of things we're focused on.
When it comes to the investments we've made in Brazil, I think – and our thought process
was the macro one that is identifying Brazil as a fantastic market to deploy our core skills
of data analytics, of claims management as well as technology or web expertise. The
investment opportunity that we found is small but leading edge as far as we're
concerned. It is in distribution, and therefore, data analytics and web skill set are areas
where we hope to lend some expertise in that partnership. We're in a minority position at
this stage.
So, the strategy of the business units itself, we think is very exciting and potentially
transportable. And then this is a fantastic platform to understand what we think is a
fantastic market as well. And as we validate some of our assumptions over time, this is
potentially a market where you could see more capital being invested, either in that
investment or potentially in manufacturing in time.

Q - Geoﬀrey Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Then just the second question I had was on Ontario auto, with the liberal win. With
the conversations you have had with them, how has the tone or your sense of the speed
and the potential magnitude of the changes that they are looking to put in place – has that
changed versus pre-election?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I've always been conﬁdent about the liberals' understanding of the issue and their intent
to bring cost reduction measures to generate 15 points, even though I've said that 15 was
really quite a stretch. We've engaged either through ourselves or the Insurance Bureau of
Canada over the past year or two in very constructive discussions about cost reduction
measures. And you've seen either and what's been done so far and what's in Bill 15.
Many of these measures, there's another long list of meaningful cost reduction measures
that we've been talking about with them, and that they've been open about. And I think
the fact that they're in a majority position really helps to make sure that they do what's
best for Ontarians. It's I think less political and much more focused on getting the best
outcome for Ontarians. So I think that net-net, the situation is positive as far as we're
concerned.

Q - Geoﬀrey Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of John Aiken with Barclays. Your line is open.

Q - John C. Aiken

{BIO 21267604 <GO>}

FINAL

Good morning. Just wanted to expand upon the distribution that the increase. You talked
about the deployment that took her (00:18:32) during the capital. What's the pipeline for
additional deployment? And where do you think the run rate contribution for this can end
up heading into 2015?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

So when it comes to distribution activities, John, there's really – you can think about it in
two buckets. The ﬁrst bucket is our broker link distribution platform, which I referred to in
my remarks. This is clearly a business unit that has grown tremendously. We think that if
you take a 24 to 36 months' perspective, we'll see meaningful growth on that side of the
house. It's heavily personal lines driven. It provides tremendous optionality in distribution
for us. And it's a big supporter of Intact Insurance. So it helps on the distribution front but
I think in time, certainly, we'll move the needle in manufacturing front. That's the ﬁrst half,
and I will let Louis Marcotte, our CFO, to talk about his perspective for prospective
earnings in that business.

Bloomberg Transcript

The second half of the distribution operation are what we call broker ﬁnancial services
where we have a number of partnerships from coast to coast, 50%/50% partnership with
very good brokers, very entrepreneurial brokers who understand that growing through
acquisitions is the way to win the game in the personal line distribution. And that's the
second half of our investments in distribution.
We're prepared to invest provided the returns in both these segments are very good. And
clearly, a lot of upsides in BrokerLink and certainly a fair bill of upside in broker ﬁnancial
services, so two areas we're prepared to support. I've talked about the fact that this
generated in the quarter only $30 million. So it gives you a sense, I think, prospectively of
the earnings power, but I will let Louis complement some of the points I've made.

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

So, ﬁrstly, on the pipeline, Charles talked about the pace in the quarter. We expect a
similar pace going forward in the next 12 months, maybe a bit slower but in the same
range. On earnings, on distribution earnings and I will point out that those are not
including in our underwriting income. They're separately reported, but they're part of the
operating income. And the run rate, annually, were roughly in the $75 million, and we
expect that the acquisitions will grow that by 15%, 20% going forward. So it is a point of
combined ratio if you compare it to premiums, and that will grow as we take it forward.
And then, obviously, there are some premiums that will beneﬁt from through those
acquisitions.

Q - John C. Aiken

Great. Thanks. I appreciate the color.

Your next question comes from the line of Tom MacKinnon with BMO Capital. Your line is
open.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah. Thanks very much. Good morning.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Good morning, Tom.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

I was wondering if you want to elaborate a little bit more about what you are going to do
to improve results in commercial and some of the actions you are going to be taking. It
sounds like a rate hikes haven't been able to keep up with the increase in severity. It is –
are you going to be planning on taking a little bit more segmented approach to your
business with respect to commercial lines?
I know that this is a bit of a balance, because you have got to certainly maintain – you
don't want to lose any of your good groups there, and you want to maintain your
relationships with your distributors as well. So maybe you can elaborate as to what you
might be looking at trying to do in commercial, and how long before we would be able to
see the results hit your target of, I believe, low 90%s.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. So, I think, Tom, we're disappointed by these results and we will act and accelerate
our action if needed until we're comfortable that this thing is going back in the low 90s.
That's the ﬁrst point I will make. Now, we've taken action based on slightly over a year of
bad results which included some bad luck in there. And as such, we think that what we
have in the pipeline right now is enough to get us in the low 90s, but it's in a quarter or
two, our perspective change you'll see the actions change further than what we've
changed right now.
And when I talk about – look, I'll give you an example, of course, there has been storms,
we've had large losses from the past, creep up a bit, and when I look at the second
quarter, unlike the previous three or four quarters, the commercial lines performance was
highly uneven depending on the region and in fact, the poor combined ratio of 100% is
driven exclusively by one region where the other three regions were operating well in the
90%s.
So I think what we ought to do is assess the opportunities available in the market where
we can move the needle on rate, where we're convinced that it's not bad luck but pure
bad performance and that's on that basis. Fair bit in the pipeline, and I will let Alain
Lessard to talk about some of these action.

FINAL

Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2014-07-30

Yes, thank you, Charles. So I think, Tom, you have to look at also the rate increase, the
keeping up of the rate increase. The rate increase in this quarter are about 4.8% basically
5% in the last two months and that's being increasing quarter-to-quarter for the last
quarter. We started six quarter ago at pushing about 1.9% rate increase now we're
pushing up to 5% rate increase. And those rate increase are not – they're in average, but
they're pretty segmented – pushing a lot more rate increase towards the worst part of the
portfolio, the worst 25% that we've mentioned so there's a little bit of time for that to take
eﬀect.
We've also implemented following the catastrophe of last year minimum deductible on
ﬂood coverage, okay? We're also have geocoded all our risk to improve the capacity
management but I think that's important to understand that geocoding brings us also
alternative because we will be implementing in the third quarter, new rates for sure
backup and ﬂood, and the ﬂood territory are basically based on all the geocoding we've
done on our risk to make sure that the risks that are within close vicinity of a river or
exposed to ﬂood are the one getting the higher rate increase or even higher deductibles.

Bloomberg Transcript

We are also reducing our earthquake exposure. I think Louis mentioned that it's going to
be the third or the last – the next quarter will be basically the last quarter of our
earthquake management. This will translate also in reduced cost of earthquakes that will
materialize in the future quarter.
We're reviewing broker performance in the worst region to make sure we're getting the
best portfolio of the broker, we are not anti-selected. We have implemented in early Q3,
basically two weeks ago, a new pricing algorithm based on GLM that will also help us
improve the selection and the risk segmentation.
So we think that all of those, all combined together, are suﬃcient to bring us back to the
low 90%. But like Charles mentioned, if more action are needed and are warranted
following the next quarter, or two or three quarter, we're prepared to take on more action,
both on rate selection or segmentation.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Thanks, Alain. I think what's important to realize also is the fact that despite the fact that
we think our commercial lines performance is not good, it's still industry-leading. And
what that tells me in a low interest rate environment is that the industry is bound to
change. And I think, Alain pointed to the fact that the industry has changed in the past
year but it might be worth, Alain, giving some ﬂavor on what you see in the market these
days.

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 21962461 <GO>}

Well, like we've seen, we have a few facts that tells us that the market is really ﬁrming up.
We are pushing more rate increase every quarter and our retention is still holding, we had
pushed a lot of rate increase also on new business, mostly at the last quarter of 2013 and
early in 2014, and we saw because of that some pressure on the closing ratio. The closing

Page 9 of 21

Date: 2014-07-30

FINAL

ratio is how much of our submission transform into a new business. So, we had seen a lot
of pressure and a drop on that.
And in the second quarter, we're seeing an increase in our closing ratio on commercial
P&Cs, so that's telling us that our rates are better accepted in the market. Okay? And on
more anecdotal basis, we also see company pulling out from niche market. We're seeing
company that are more and more taking a ﬁrmer stance in rate increase at renewal.
Although there's still a healthy appetite for good proﬁle or the best risk proﬁle business,
we see a lot more action anecdotally on increasing or ﬁrming up the market.
So, we think that this is in fact the reaction to low interest environment. We think it's about
the third year in a row that the commercial P&C business had a combined ratio in excess
of 100%. The insurance cost increased a little bit in 2014. So, all of that seems now to
converge into a market ﬁrming up.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I think, though, let's be clear, it's still very competitive for new business in aggregates. I
wouldn't want people to think that we're headed full speed in a hard market at this stage.
I think there's still a fair bit of appetite for new business in the market, but I think
directionally speaking, we think it's headed in the right way.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Charles, you mentioned you think what's in the pipeline is enough to get in the low 90%s,
although you sometimes you come across in a quarter a bit of bad luck. Was there any
bad luck in this quarter? It doesn't look like there was any kind of cat loss issue, and the
prior development was actually pretty good. So was there any bad luck in commercial
P&C in this quarter?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

So the issue was the performance in the west primarily, and I will let Alain comment on
what we've observed there because, as I've mentioned, all the other divisions had a pretty
good performance. Not good enough but pretty good, just for the record.

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 21962461 <GO>}

Yes. So overall, the underlying loss ratio deteriorated by a few points versus year-on-year
last year. It's driven basically by two elements. There's a little bit more large losses on a
national basis, all of them mostly concentrated out West. We also saw an increase in
severity. And the severity increase is driven pretty much by ﬁre losses. We had more ﬁre
losses.
Although the severity was stable, the mix between liability and ﬁre losses changed, and
the severity of ﬁre losses are much higher than any severity of liability, the severity of
enlarged – in ﬁre are both six times what we normally see our liability, which are smaller
cases. So clearly, the fact that we have more ﬁre, more increase on the ﬁre side as

Page 10 of 21



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp

Date: 2014-07-30

FINAL

translated into deterioration. And that relates to what Charles was saying because we
have diﬀerent quarters, and the situation from quarter-to-quarter has been very diﬀerent.
Last year was pretty much cat driven issue. The ﬁrst quarter was more related to weather
losses as well as some large losses, but more water damage. And this quarter, it's much
more out West ﬁre losses that are being aﬀected. So we don't see a common pattern or
something emerging out in every quarter. But in spite that, it's still ﬁve quarter in a row
that we're disappointed with the results, that's why we're taking the current corrective
action.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. That's it. We're not going to rest until we're conﬁdent. This is headed in the right
direction. Tom, at the end of 2013, we had 3 points loss ratio outperformance to the
industry. So that feeds into our view about where the market is going.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning. So, Charles, I recall from last call that you appreciate the
reﬂection questions. I want to change the topic of conversation a little bit here, away from
commercial P&C, and ask about personal auto. One of your growth initiatives starting I
guess well over a year now was to push the premiums written in GTA speciﬁcally, since
you thought the risk-price dynamics had improved in that market. Is that still the case?
And what kind of progress have you made?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I guess it's refreshing to talk about Ontario auto in relationship with growth, Paul, so you
can take that for credit. I think – so what's our perspective and our appetite for growth in
Ontario automobile right now? I'll let Patrick share his perspective on the margin and as a
result, what it means for us in terms of growth.

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Yeah. Our view is still very positive about Ontario auto growth perspective. We have – the
industry has taken a bit more than 5% rate decrease as we did as well at Intact. During the
second quarter, we have implemented that rate increase and we were doing it a bit later
than most of our competitors and...

...decrease, sorry; I said increase. Decrease, 5% decrease. So, it put pressure a bit on our
new business production during the quarter. But the reforms on cost reduction measures
that have been implemented the ones that are included in the – they'll ﬁt some of the
other discussions we're having with the government allow us to be very positive about
growing in Ontario and now that this ﬁrst wave is there I think we're in better position to
continue to grow the units in Ontario.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. No, exactly. I think we are assessing – it's been important – rate dislocations, as you
know, across many markets. So we're in the process of reassessing where additional
opportunities might lie for us. The folks in the direct channel, in better direct in particular,
are seeing very healthy growth there and we're pretty comfortable with that growth. And I
think the cost environment is actually pretty good.

Bloomberg Transcript

I think reforms are holding pretty steady. We're pleased with the cost reduction measures
that the government is talking about. And we're sitting with BI and AB adjusters last week
just to make sure that we were in touch with what these guys saw, and I think very much a
good environment to operate in. There is inﬂation. There's no doubt, a little bit of inﬂation
in the system, but nowhere near what one could have expected as a result of reforms, so.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Okay. Continuing on Ontario auto, rate reductions to date are roughly 5.5% with a 15%
objective for August next year. 10 points, call it 9.5 points, 10 points over the next year
seems like a pretty aggressive target. Is that achievable at this point?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Well, I've always said that 15 points of cost-reduction measures focused on Accident
Beneﬁt would be very diﬃcult to achieve. And I think I've said that from the moment that
the number was thrown out. I think one way to get there, in which we've engaged the
government, is to focus not only on Accident Beneﬁt but to focus on the tort side of the
house as well, on bodily injury litigation, so to speak, which is available for excess
economic damages as well as pain and suﬀering awards if you're severely injured. We
think that there's room there. And I'll let Patrick give his perspective on directionally
speaking the sort of measures that could be considered to get towards 15%. So bottom
line, long answer to say, 15% is a stretch. But I think it's possible to get there and it's the
basis on which we engage with the government.
Go ahead, Patrick.

FINAL

So the bill 15 that is currently being introduced, as Charles I think mentioned in his
opening remarks, is the combination of two legislations that were put aside at the last –
the last election. Those are worth a few points already in our view and we believe this bill
will be passed quickly.
We are already in discussions through the Insurance Bureau of Canada and ourselves with
diﬀerent parts of the government to discuss some of the next steps that could be
implemented quickly after the bill 15. And some of those – there are some that continue to
be targeting the AB side. So I think the catastrophic impairment deﬁnition is one example,
trying to shorten the med rehab beneﬁt period from 10 to 4 years to be more in line with
other programs from government. There's a threshold also in income replacement beneﬁt
that is being looked at.
The tort system and ﬁrst, in the tort system there are a lot of the fees that are paid and that
don't go directly to the injured. And that's the ﬁrst part we would like to target. And
there's also a discussion about potentially revising the ﬁling process. Those are all ideas
that are starting to be discussed and there's probably more than the 10 points needed
overall in those actions. It's just a matter of how quickly now they can be implemented.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

In the past, you have talked about the appetite to increase the proportion of premium that
comes from the commercial P&C, including, I believe, through acquisition. Has that
appetite changed at all, given your recent experience in the commercial P&C lines?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Nope. Not all. I think the track record is a great one of 6 points (00:39:10) of
outperformance in the past ﬁve years. I think that – Tom was asking earlier about
segmentation and more segmentation in commercial lines. I would say that when I look at
where Alain's team and the actuaries have taken our ability to segment in commercial
lines, I mean, it's as sophisticated, if not more sophisticated than in personal lines. I think
we have a great business model for small and medium businesses, and the more capital
we could put there, the better. I think it's an important core competency of ours and,
therefore, if we could put more capital there, we would.
The other area that we are performing quite well is in specialty lines. And specialty lines,
in general, has been on upper 80%s and low 90%s segment of our business. We really
bulked it up with the AXA acquisition, and I think we're still quite under represented
there. So if we could capital to grow that segment, we certainly would.
And it's not the fact that the past four quarters, ﬁve quarters have been bad that will
change our strategic perspective on that. I think if you have sustainable outperformance,
you ought to build on that. But we have to operate in the low 90%s, and that's what we're
focused on right now. So Alain, I don't know if there's anything that you want to add there.

No. But I think you've mentioned that specialty solution or specialty lines also remains an
opportunity as our presence or our market share on those is very variable across Canada.
And there is some – a region where we are really underrepresented in that segment, and
that's opportunity for the future.

FINAL

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Okay. Final question with respect to personal auto and reserve development there. A few
quarters ago, I think you suggested that reserve development in that line of business was
likely to stay above average for 12 months to 24 months. This quarter it came down, and
you identiﬁed a couple reasons why. Is there any change in view with respect to the
longer-term outlook – or I guess really the short-term outlook, the next 12 months, call it,
having higher than normal reserve development?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

No, I think Patrick might want to give additional color on the favorable development but
no, I mean it's just the three months, it's three months in automobile insurance, it's not a
lot. It's within the range or view. Our view has not changed and if anything, I'm very
comfortable with the reserving position that we have. Patrick, maybe you want to give a
little bit more color there.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Yeah, during the quarter, there was a couple elements that contributed to the lower
favorable development we have observed in personal auto. The ﬁrst one is an
unfavorable development coming from the pools of the RSP and the Facility Association.
Most of it is coming from Alberta.
Development patterns in those pools contain lags, as they rely on data coming from many
diﬀerent companies. And as you know, on our side we have kept ourselves on top of the
situation over the last 18 months, and we believe that this is just now the reﬂection of the
same patterns that's the pool are doing, and that are already recognized in our own
portfolio. So we don't expect this to have any impact on a – or any signiﬁcant impact in the
future from the assumed pools.
The other part that we can mention is also just on favorable developments on a very few
large old ﬁles that aﬀected during Q2. But that's also, in our view, just a one-time impact.
When we combine those two considerations, I guess the prior year development during
the quarter is very much in the range, as you mentioned, Charles. And year-to-date, even
with those impact, it's also within the range of our long-term view.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

It might be good to get Mathieu's perspective at the end of the day, these guys are
putting up most of their reserves so any additional color you can bring, Mathieu?

FINAL

Yes, I'll – operationally, we see nothing that concerns us in the prior year development.
And as you mentioned, we think the reforms are holding, and we have no adverse
decision in arbitration so far. Our percentage of med cases is holding above the reform
assumption in the mid-60s. In BI we observe a lower frequency increase than expected
with their reform assumptions. So, as you mentioned, talking to adjuster on the ﬂoor, no
trend that would concern us at this point.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is open.

Q - Brian R. Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yeah. Good morning. A couple questions here. First, Charles, I was wondering on the
personal auto segment, back there, your underlying combined ratio there, the ex-cat, exreserves development deteriorated on a year-over-year basis. Does that have anything to
do with some of the delayed stuﬀ coming through in Ontario as far as loss initiatives?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I'll let Patrick comment. We'll focus on the underlying loss ratio maybe not get into
expenses and commissions here, because that's where your question is going.

Q - Brian R. Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yep.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

So I'll let Patrick comment on the fact that the underlying lost ratio deteriorated just a little
bit during the quarter.

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Yeah, it deteriorated by – it was less than a point during the quarter driven by severity. It's
comforting, though, when you look at on the severity side the year-to-date numbers, the
severity has not increased, so it's ﬂat. So overall, when we look at the year-to-date
number, the only impact that's left year-on-year is the increased frequency coming from
the other winter conditions.
But if I go back a bit, and all the way up until prior to the Ontario reforms, you would
recall that the underlying loss ratio there was in the 76%, 77% range. The Ontario reforms
were expecting to get about 12 points improvement coming from Ontario, and the
Ontario book being half of the overall book, that meant about 6 points overall.

Page 15 of 21



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp

FINAL

And that's what you've seen in the two years after that in 2011 and 2012 with about 70%
range underlying loss ratio. There was a slight deterioration in 2013, so a bit more than a
point. But as you mentioned, Charles, there's normal inﬂation also a bit in the system. First
quarter year-on-year was due to the hard winter conditions, higher frequency and as I said
in Q2, just a slight deterioration. But nothing concerning from our point of view.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

No. I think, Brian, so it's 0.8% worse than the same quarter a year ago, and we've seen a
bit of severity. We dug into severity and there are many pieces that make up severity.
That's why we went, sat down with the adjusters in the past few weeks, tried to ﬁgure out
whether there was anything of substance there, or any trend. And the answer is clearly no,
in my mind. And again, at three months, so 0.8% deterioration, three months over three
months, nothing concerning there.

Q - Brian R. Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you. Then my second question, just to go back to the commercial P&C, because I
understand it's a little bit better. If you are talking about getting around 5% rate right now,
and I think you said that also you expected the pipeline right now, what you see, is going
to get you back to the low 90%s in the commercial P&C business. That would imply to me
that the bad luck is close to 10 points of bad luck that you have been having over the last,
call it 9 months. Is that correct?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 21962461 <GO>}

Okay. I think – probably not totally correct, because we have other than only rate action
coming through. We think that the rate action are giving us more than just the rate
because the segmentation we see – the business we're losing on the renewal are the one
where the rate increase are the largest. And these have had very negative loss ratio and
combined ratio in the past. So there's more than just the rates aﬀecting that.
We also have some impact coming from the reinsurance cost reduction and exposure on
earthquake that's coming through. And it's going to come through more in the second
half of 2014 but mostly in 2015, okay? Combined with some increase on deductible we
see and some broker management, we feel that there's more than – if you think that the
rates of about 5% would account for only 2 points, we see our – the overall plan as being
able to generate something more in the range of the 5 points, okay? And that, bringing us
to low 90s. Kind of the bad luck we see is much less than the 10 point. We say that's
probably more in the region to 3 to 5 points.

Q - Brian R. Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you. Makes sense. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Doug Young with Desjardins Capital. Your line
is open.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Hi, good morning.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

FINAL

Good morning, Doug.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

First question, just going back to the prior year reserve development, I just wanted to
clarify. So the historical average has been 3% to 4%. Is the indication that you anticipate
that you will continue to be above that? Because you have been running quite a bit above
that over the last while. And how quickly do you think you get back to the 3% to 4%? And
then can you quantify – you kind of outlined two items that happened in quarter in
personal auto. Can you quantify what the impact those two items had? That is my ﬁrst
question.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So, you're at the very high level. I think one should think about favorable development
going forward, thinking about the historical average. Is there a bias towards more than
historical average in the near term. I would say probably. But I think you want to think
about favorable development using the long-term average. Because the visibility around
the bias above that is hard to have because it's about the maturity of the reforms. No,
you'll have a bunch of new cost-reduction measures introduced in the system. Don't
forget that we're going into it with expected impact. We'll need time to ﬁgure out what is
the actual impact of those future cost-reduction measures.
The second point is BI. As you know, the lag between accident ﬁling, serving the claim,
ﬁling the claim and settling the claim in BI is huge. And that has been a source of caution
on our part. Every sign we're seeing there turns out to be better than what was expected
when the reform came in. So I feel good about where we are from a reserving point of
view. But we think about reserving prospectively in line with historical ranges, and we're
very happy when it's more than that. But I wouldn't signal more than that necessarily with
great certainty in the coming 24 months.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

And is it possible to quantify what those two items were in the quarter?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. Absolutely.

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Yes. If I combine the two elements I discussed, so the unfavorable development from the
pools and a few large old ﬁles, in percentage of earned premium that would bring our
ratio from 0.4% favorable development to around 2%.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

To 2%? Okay. The second question, I know in the quarter, I think in June, you had a bunch
of losses that didn't hit the cat threshold, but I think it had an impact. Can you quantify
what that was? And has that all been put through, obviously, in second quarter?

FINAL

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

So it's all been put through in the second quarter. There's no doubt about that. I think it's
a hard one to quantify because you don't code these things as cat, and we don't have a
code for almost cat. So I think this is when you get into ranges I don't know if Louis, you
have more intelligent answer to give but it's a tricky one here.

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Yes, so it's roughly $10 million to $12 million in total in that range for those types. And
those are really the ones that don't hit that 7.5 threshold that is in the month of June. So,
that's roughly the space we're at.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, I think when I look at the quarter myself, if I just share timeline here. April was tough,
right? We had the tail end of the winter, a lot of water, a tough month and then May and
June, despite those non-cat weather events, we're actually pretty good. Like we felt we
were on a good run rate. So what the story doesn't clearly tell is that the tail end of the
winter weather melting really hurt us in April. But then, with the Angus Tornado and a few
things like that, hit a very nice run rate in May and June.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Okay. Just my last question. The MCT I believe declined sequentially. I think that was a
result of your required capital increasing. I guess my question is: What was that related to
in the quarter? Was that just a shift of investment assets and required capital went up?
Can you give some color?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah, so we have the both impact, the higher assets and some investments in higher –
that require capital, that really are the main drivers of it.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

FINAL

Good morning. This question sort of may capture some of the answers you have already
provided; but, Charles, throughout the press release there is references to higher severity.
It is in personal auto, it is in personal property, and also in commercial other. And I don't
suspect those three are anywhere related. But can you add anything to that? Like what
speciﬁcally do you think was driving that across the three segments?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. So, I would say that property whether it's personal or commercial in the quarter,
you've seen wind and storm events that lead to a higher average loss than what you
normally see in a quarter. And that's true in personal lines, and that's true to a certain
extent in commercial lines. In both personal and commercial, you've seen a greater mix of
ﬁres. That leads to a higher average loss in both personal and in commercial lines. So I
would say these two things cut across the non-automobile lines of business. And in
commercial lines, as Alain has pointed out, we've had a few large losses primarily in the
west that have contributed to it. So, on the basis of property, I'm not concerned on the
basis of these answers.

Bloomberg Transcript

I think on severity, Patrick gave a pretty good answer in my mind which is not concerning
to us and this is where I think in automobile insurance, while there is a reference to
severity, frequency is actually going down. And that's why the underlying loss ratio in
automobile insurance is only up 0.8%. And there's a number of small elements there that
are, in our view, one-oﬀ in nature, but I don't think there's much more to it than that,
Mario, and I can tell you that we've been peddling a fair bit in the past few weeks just to
ﬁgure out what I've mentioned here, and where there was not anything else under. And at
this stage, that's pretty much the story.

Q - Mario C. Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Okay. And then you make reference in your press release again – and this is something I
think you always refer to – the increased arbitration proceedings in personal auto, Ontario
speciﬁcally. Is there any connection between that arbitration or anything that is happening
in the arbitration? Is there any new information falling out of the arbitration that could
have impacted the reserve development in the quarter?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I'll let Mathieu take this one, maybe give a broader arbitration perspective and then
development in the quarter.

A - Mathieu Lamy

{BIO 15207469 <GO>}

Yes. As the mediation have gone down, the arbitration has gone up at the level of the
industry, but so far – and in our case, in fact, the number of arbitrations pending is quite
stable over the last few years. So on that point, I think it doesn't have an impact on the
reserved development.
In terms of decision on arbitration, we've seen only positive news, and we even had the
recent decision that reaﬃrmed that the onus of proof that you're outside the MIG – is on
the burden of that proof is on the person applying for being outside of the mix. So those
Page 19 of 21



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp

Date: 2014-07-30

are – this is a positive decision. There is no bad decision or adverse decision thus far. So I
would say no, there's no impact here on the reserve development, thus far.

FINAL

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. I think that the thing we tried to understand, Mario, in the prior development, there
were a number of large ﬁles whether it is BI, NAB. These ﬁles were looked at beyond the
guys who manage these ﬁles to make sure that it's not something in the system that has
led to a change in the reserve on these big cases, but rather new information on this ﬁle
or these ﬁles that would change our perspective on reserves, if you know what I'm saying.

Q - Mario C. Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

I do. So the information was speciﬁc to those cases and not something that you would
apply broadly.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Exactly right. And so there's about 20 cases across the business units that have been
scrutinized by Mathieu and his team. And the very speciﬁc question they were after is
exactly what you've asked, is there anything in the system that you could read through
across these ﬁles. And I don't think the answer at this stage is yes.
