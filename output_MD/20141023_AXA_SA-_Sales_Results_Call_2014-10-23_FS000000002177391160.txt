Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the First Nine Months 2014 Activity Indicators Release
Conference Call. I now hand over to Mr. Andrew Wallace-Barnett. Sir, please go ahead.

Andrew Wallace-Barnett

{BIO 18671460 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you, and good evening, everyone, and welcome to the AXA conference call on our
activity indicators for the first nine months of 2014. Gérald Harlin, our Group CFO, will firstly give
you a quick reminder of the main figures included in the press release which we issued earlier this
afternoon and which you can find on our website. And then following that, Gérald will be happy to
answer your questions.
Gérald, I hand over to you.

Gérald Harlin
Okay. Thank you, Andrew. Hello. Good evening and thank you. Before moving to the Q&A session,
let me give you a quick recap of the main figures for the first nine months.
Overall, we have continued to see growth across all business lines with total revenues up 2% on a
comparable basis. I would like to remind you that forex had a negative impact again this year with
the stronger euro on average compared to last year against most Asian currencies and the U.S.
dollar. This explains why on a reported basis, revenue were stable.
On the Life side, encouragingly, the APE was up 3% on a comparable basis for the first nine
months including an increase in APE in high-growth markets of 13%. The nine month 3% APE growth
comes partly from the continued success of our hybrid products in Continental Europe, and also
from the second consecutive quarter of growth in Protection & Health, more than offsetting the
negative impact we saw in the first quarter out of Switzerland and Germany. At the same time, the
NBV margin continued to increase, and is 34% versus 33% one year ago for the first nine months
of 2013.
P&C revenues were up 2%, benefiting from price increases of 1.9% on average and higher volumes
in Direct and Asia. Assets under management reached €1 trillion at the end of September, up 12%



from the end of 2013, driven by market appreciation, FX and positive net flows at both AXA IM and
AllianceBernstein.

FINAL

Note as well that our economic solvency is estimated to be stable at around 213% at the end of
September. Finally, I would like to remind you that we will come back to the market and to you on
November 20 with an Investor Day, which will be dedicated to our savings and asset management
activities.
I'm now happy to answer your questions.

Q&A
Operator
We have a question from Paul De'Ath from RBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Paul C. De'Ath

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Hi there. And thanks for taking my question. Couple of questions for you on this one. And
firstly just on the GMxB buyouts in the U.S., and obviously there's been a bit of a further outflows
due to that in the quarter. And I just wondered if you could remind us on how much more there
might be to come on that, and also what level of take up you've now seen on those buyouts.
And then, the second question was, again on the kind of flow side of things. You've obviously
highlighted good results in hybrid products across Continental Europe. But the Unit-Linked flows,
when you ex out the GMxB buyouts, are still relatively weak for the quarter. I just wondered if you
could expand on where else you're seeing outflows, if that's okay. Thanks.

A - Gérald Harlin
Okay. So let's start first with your question about the GMxB. So the buyouts, you remember that we
mentioned that the buyout ended with a negative outflow of €1.1 billion in the first quarter. And in
fact, now, it's a bit more than €1.3 billion. Where is it coming from? It's coming from the fact that
the New York State was quite late at validating this buyout, which means that in the third quarter,
we had still outflows of €0.2 billion.
On the first question relative to – the take up rate was €13.5 (4:50). So quite good. We are
extremely satisfied with this take up rate.
And as far as the outflows are concerned, what I would like to say that, indeed, we had, in the UK,
and that's I believe the reason why when you make the calculation in the third quarter, you end up
with quite poorer than expected figure in term of net flows in Unit-Linked. It's coming from the UK
where we had a net outflow on two large individual contracts, pension contracts, corporate type
(05:34) contracts of €0.5 billion.
As you may know, these contracts have a very low margin. And these contracts are moving from
one company to the other. And these moves are driven by consultants. So except this, we had a
good quarter and we are quite satisfied with our Unit-Linked business.

Q - Paul C. De'Ath
Okay. Thanks.

Operator
A question from Nick Holmes from SocGén. Please go ahead.



Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 21515144 <GO>}

FINAL

Hello there. Yeah. I had a couple of quick questions. The first one is, can you give us any idea at all
of the impact of the recent market volatility on your U.S. operations? And secondly, I think there's
been some bad flooding in France in September, and I just wondered any idea what that might
cost you? Thank you.

A - Gérald Harlin
Okay. So as far as the first question is concerned about the U.S. GMxB, in fact, we didn't suffer so
much from volatility. Why, because we are much more subject to equity volatility. And presently, we
have a quite high percentage of volatility, which is covered. And roughly speaking, today we should
be, roughly speaking, at 70% coverage of volatility. It was 80% at the end of September, and now
we should be at 70%, 75%. So no worry on the volatility.
And I just would like to tell you that on top of my head, if you take the realized volatility, for
example, last week, it was 12%. So it was relatively low. So we had a few days indeed, where
volatility went up, but I'm not worried.
Your second question was about the bad flooding in the south of France. I'm not expecting
something that would be – we are more or less in line. The FFSA and the French Association
announced a global cost of €320 million for the whole market. So taking our market share, I'm not
expecting something which would be worrying and that's part of – even if it's concerned natural
catastrophes, it's part of our attritional cost. It's in our pricing, I would say.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 21515144 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you for that, Gérald. Just one very quick follow-up. Just broadening out my question
on the recent market volatility, are you concerned at all about sales numbers? I mean, not just in
the U.S. but more broadly because of what's happened in the markets.

A - Gérald Harlin
Your question is about what? Sales?

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 21515144 <GO>}

Sorry. Yes, sales. I mean, just, whether you think the problems in the markets are going to have any
material effect for the sales more widely.

A - Gérald Harlin
Not really, not really. And we had – look at our figures, and when you look at our Q3 numbers, you
can notice that we started with APE sales in Life, which were negative in the first quarter, as I
mentioned. We were roughly at zero at the end of midyear for the first six months. And now, we
are at plus 3%, which means that in the end, we had a nice progression of this quarter. So honestly,
I would not say that we are suffering from this volatility.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 21515144 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

Operator
A question from (09:46) from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
Hello, Gérald. How are you?



A - Gérald Harlin
Hello. How are you?

FINAL

Q - Operator
Good. Thank you. Just one – actually two questions. I'm looking at your new business margins, and I
see you're making some nice progress in the U.S. and then Switzerland and Hong Kong as well, but
what is catching my eye is the reduction in margin you're seeing in the Mediterranean region, 5
points reduction in margin despite the fact that you're selling quite strong volumes of business
there. I just wonder what's going on there, and why you're selling so much volume of lower-margin
business.
And secondly, I wonder if you'd expect to see within the asset management business,
AllianceBernstein, in particular, whether you'd expect to see any benefit from some of the
dislocation you're seeing amongst some of the high-profile competitors in the fixed income
market.

A - Gérald Harlin

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Let's start with your first question, Blair (10:52). What I can say is that it's due to business mix.
That means that this business is quite sensitive to the business mix because we had large moves
and significant increase in APE because total APE went up by 31% in the MedLA region. And it
comes from the fact that, for example, as I mentioned, in Italy, I'll take the example of Italy, in Italy
with AXA MPS, we've been selling a lot of hybrid products that, in fact, mixing general account and
Unit-Linked.
And on the marginal basis, it had a lower profitability than the business that we did one year ago
over the same period. So we cannot say that it's a deterioration of our profitability, not at all. It's
exclusively a business mix issue.
On your last question about what you call the dislocation of the asset management business, I
would say not yet. As you know, we are doing well with AB, but for sure normally and taking into
account the size of our business, we should also get some benefit of these moves. And we will
see in the future, but we are quite happy with the evolution of our business receipts (12:37).

Q - Operator
Thanks. Thanks, Gérald. Just coming back on the first question, are you saying that – because my
understanding was the hybrid product was intended to increase the margins. Are you saying that
people are just choosing a more defensive structure within the hybrid products because of the
market or what's going on there?

A - Gérald Harlin
No. But we had a decrease in margin in MPS because there is a – as a result of flow of upfront
management fees, and that explains most of the difference. So no, we are – but look, at the same
time, in the MedLA region, the NBV margin is going down 1.9 points to 26.8%. So 26.8% remains
quite a nice margin. We cannot say that it's a margin which is poor at all. But at the same time,
keep in mind that it was driven by some deterioration in Mexico and Spain and higher volumes in
Italy. And that's why I explained that it was a matter of business mix. But honestly, I'm not at all – the
message is not to say that our hybrid products have a low margin.

Q - Operator
Yeah. Okay, Gérald. That's fine. We just leave it there. I'm still not entirely clear as to what's
happening to the business mix that's making it lower margin. I mean, you had a 5-point reduction in
the MedLA margin year-on-year.



A - Gérald Harlin
Okay. We'll come back to you by phone to give you more detail so that you are convinced by this
explanation. No problem. We'll call you back.

Q - Operator

FINAL

Okay. Thank you, Gérald. Much appreciated.
A question from François Boissin, Exane BNP. Please go ahead. Mr. Boissin, your mic is open.

Q - François Boissin
Yes. Good evening. Sorry about that. Good evening, everybody. Three questions please. The first
one is basically in terms of volumes, you are seeing very good volumes in Q3. I wondered if we can
extrapolate this in Q4, so maybe a few details on the outlook would be useful.
And second question on your Solvency, I mean, it seems that 213% has been impacted by market
conditions. Can you give a bit of breakdown into what was the impact from market items, and
basically what we can expect in Q4 especially given the higher volatility around interest rates that
we saw recently?

Bloomberg Transcript

And final question around the upcoming Investor Day. Do you have a program or, let's say, themes
if you want to address? Thanks.

A - Gérald Harlin
Okay. About the first question which is the outlook. No, what I can say is only repeat what we said.
You remember that at the end of Q1, we mentioned that we were expecting to grow this year, I
can repeat it. And other than the first nine months, what I can tell you is that we are right and I
confirm.
As far as the 213% are concerned, the most important impact, François, is mostly coming from
volatility. As you know, the implied volatility because it's done on a market consistent basis, and the
implied volatility went up. And you notice that last time we posted 215%, we had a drop of 2% from
215% to 213% in our Solvency II ratio, and there are plus and minuses, the minus is coming from the
drop of interest rates and plus on the equity side. But the most important impact which roughly
correspond to this 2% is due to the rise of the volatility.

Q - François Boissin
Okay. And presumably in Q4 to-date, volatility rose even more than in Q3?

A - Gérald Harlin
No, not yet because if I take the implied volatility, there was a spike last week, but now we are
back to roughly the same territory. It's really too early to give you such an impact, but it's not
something huge in term of impact. Your last question was about?

Q - François Boissin
IR Day.

A - Gérald Harlin
IR Day. No. The objective was just to make an update. First of all, we wanted to make an update on
the asset management side. And it was a good opportunity for us to extend it to all the savings
business, which is a significant part of our business that's mostly it. We very often speak from
Protection & Health because it was something very important, which is very important in our five



years ambition AXA plan. But we believe it was quite interesting to make a specific focus on the
savings part.

Q - François Boissin

FINAL

Okay. That's interesting. And can we expect from you guys an update or, let's say, some more
details around Solvency II or is it too early?

A - Gérald Harlin
No. It's not planned to make any plan. Let me tell you where we are. That's an opportunity because
I believe many of you would like to know exactly where we are in term of Solvency II. As I explained
to some of you, Solvency II, there is no much uncertainty around Solvency II, but there is a big
element which is the validation by supervisor of our internal models. We are not the only one in the
same situation. All the large companies are at the same step. It will take part of the – a significant
part of 2015, and we can expect to give you more clarity about the final framework only in the
second part of the year and mostly in Q3 or Q4 next year. Since then, I don't expect that we can
update you much more.

Q - François Boissin
Okay. It's very clear. Thank you very much indeed.

We have no more questions. A question from Atanasio Pantarrotas from Kepler Cheuvreux. Please
go ahead.

Q - Atanasio Pantarrotas

{BIO 5933123 <GO>}

Yes. Good evening. Thank you for taking my question. I have two questions. First of all, if you are
interested in maybe in acquiring the minority stake of your joint venture with Monte Paschi in Italy?
And the second question regarding your bank. According to a Belgian press, your bank could fail to
pass the stress test. And I wonder if you can provide some details if it is true or you expect to see
the results coming on Sunday. Thank you.

A - Gérald Harlin
First of all, I would like to say that I cannot make any comment. Let's wait until Sunday just to get
the final figures that will be released for the roughly 130 banks. What I can tell you, that bank is –
keep in mind that AXA Bank Europe is a bank which is relatively small. That means that it's a bank
which has, first of all, quite good rating because it's a A rating.
And second, that it's a bank which, yes, there are six banks, which have been selected in Belgium.
And, of course, AXA bank is one of the smallest. We have a 5% market share, and it's 8% if we
take the mortgage business. It's roughly €800 million of capital. So that gives you an idea that it's
relatively small. We will see on Sunday, and what are the result of all the banks and that's it.

Q - Atanasio Pantarrotas

{BIO 5933123 <GO>}

Thank you. €800 million refers to all your European bank activity or only the Belgium one?

A - Gérald Harlin
No, no, it's a Belgium activity.

Q - Atanasio Pantarrotas

{BIO 5933123 <GO>}



Okay. Regarding the possibility that you can acquire the minority stake of Monte Paschi in your
Italian joint venture.

A - Gérald Harlin

FINAL

No. But I believe that you read the press, and you read the, what Frédéric de Courtois said. So he
said that there was no interest yet for us to buy it. So I've nothing more to add.

Q - Atanasio Pantarrotas

{BIO 5933123 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

Operator
We have no more questions at the moment. No more questions. A question from Pierre Chedeville
from CM-CIC Securities. Please go ahead.

Q - Pierre Chedeville

{BIO 15076220 <GO>}

Yes. Good evening. I have one question regarding Germany. In 2015, we will have some reform in
Germany concerning the Life business and particularly a new way, I guess, of calculating technical
provisions and also a more stricter way to see difference between reference rate and guaranteed
rate. Do you think that this will have an impact on your activity in Germany in Life business next
year? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Gérald Harlin
I cannot tell you, there are plus – I could say that there are plus and minuses in this reform. And of
course, one of the positive is that, as you know, the guaranteed rate went down. So it's quite
difficult to tell you what will be the impact. What I can tell you is that, of course, you are referring
mostly to general account business.

Q - Pierre Chedeville

{BIO 15076220 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Gérald Harlin
And, for example, in the first nine months, we had a nice progression in our Unit-Linked business.
Whatever happens, and let's be clear, and it doesn't change from what we said before. We don't
have so much appetite for general account in Germany. What we want to do is, either in all our
countries to sell general account with Unit-Linked or to sell Unit-Linked. And we had a nice
progression on Unit-Linked in Germany that's what I can tell you. And for the pure general account
business, we will see next year. It's difficult. Again, plus and minuses.

Q - Pierre Chedeville

{BIO 15076220 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Operator
We have no more questions for the moment. We have no more questions. No more questions for
the moment.

A - Andrew Wallace-Barnett

{BIO 18671460 <GO>}

Okay. Well, thank you then everybody, for listening, and we look forward to seeing you in Paris on
November 20 for our IR Day on savings and asset management businesses. So thank you and
good evening.



A - Gérald Harlin
Thank you all. Bye-bye.
