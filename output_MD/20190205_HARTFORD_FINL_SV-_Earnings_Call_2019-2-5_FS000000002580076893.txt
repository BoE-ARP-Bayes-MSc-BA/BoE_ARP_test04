Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. 2018 was another great year at The
Hartford. We had numerous accomplishments including excellent financial results despite
a second consecutive year of high catastrophe losses. Full year 2018 net income was $1.8
billion and core earnings were $1.6 billion or $4.33 per diluted share, up 58%. The core
earnings ROE for the year was 11.6%, well in excess of our cost of capital.
With the exception of catastrophe losses, business metrics were in line or better than our
outlook. Group Benefits had an outstanding year with better than expected disability
experience and investment income. Commercial Lines delivered strong results including
superb Small Commercial underwriting performance, new business production, and
retention. The Commercial Lines underlying combined ratio improved about 50 basis
points to 91.5, among the best in the industry.

FINAL

Personal Lines results were negatively impacted by two hurricanes and the largest U.S.
wildfire loss in insurance industry history. However, the underlying Personal Lines combined
ratio of 91.2 was in line with our outlook and 2 points better than 2017. New business levels
were up in Personal Lines this year, which was a key goal that aligns with AARP objectives.
This partnership, which is approaching 35 years, is truly unique and collaborative. We
provide their membership with unique products and quality service, and we are working
together to grow the book with a focus on AARP's younger cohort, ages 50 to 60.
In addition to financial results, I am pleased with our effective and consistent operational
execution in 2018. We continue to make investments in people, processes and
technology, enhancing service quality and speed. Our customers and distribution partners
value the enhanced digital capabilities, broader product offerings, and an expanded risk
appetite that we are bringing to them.
Net Promoter Scores continue to climb, and claims quality ratings are strong. This year we
also made progress on our innovation agenda, including the launch of the Small Business
Innovation Lab located in New York City and the purchase of Y-Risk, a company
specializing in the sharing and on-demand economy.

Bloomberg Transcript

Finally, major strategic activities in 2018 included the sale of Talcott, substantial progress
on the integration of Group Benefits, and the announcement of The Navigators
acquisition.
Related to the acquisition, yesterday we announced the new operating model and
organizational structure and the formation of a new Global Specialty business. This
structure aligns with The Hartford's Commercial Lines businesses with The Navigators'
U.S. and global operations and will optimize underwriting expertise and distribution
relationships. Integration planning is well underway, and the new teams will be out in the
market quickly after closing.
In addition to its strategic contributions, we expect it to generate an attractive financial
return with incremental annual core earnings before amortization of intangibles of
approximately $200 million within four to five years after closing.
In 2019, we will build on our accomplishments and momentum. Doug will cover the outlook
for key business metrics in more detail, but I have a few macro observations.
Overall, we expect our businesses to perform well. The U.S. economy remains in a
relatively strong position compared to Europe and other parts of the world. That said, we
expect some slowdown in the U.S. economy. In addition, with Brexit still unresolved, the
volatile equity and bond markets, slowing global growth, and continued uncertainty about
global trade and tariffs, previous tailwinds may become headwinds particularly for
investment performance.
In P&C generally, we expect underwriting margins and earnings to remain strong in 2019.
With lower catastrophe losses, we expect Personal Lines to improve and underlying
margins to remain healthy. In Commercial Lines, we expect underlying margins to remain
Page 3 of 25

Company Ticker: H I G US Equity
Date: 2019-02-05

FINAL

very attractive but with some modest pressure on workers' comp. Finally, we expect the
Group Benefits core earnings margin to remain very strong although slightly down from
2018 due to lower projected limited partnership returns, consistent with our long-term
view.
For 2019, our strategic priorities remain consistent, and we will strive to maintain core
earnings ROEs well above our cost of equity capital. Achieving this, along with growing
book value excluding AOCI and dividends per common share, will drive long-term
shareholder value creation.
Turning to operational goals, expanding product capabilities and risk appetite remain key
pillars of our strategy. With the recent acquisitions, we will have what we need and we'll
be intensely focused on realizing the combined potential, including deepening distribution
relationships and meeting a broader array of customer needs.

Bloomberg Transcript

In addition to product depth and breadth, our strategy also emphasizes customer focus
and talent management as well as building capabilities that make us an easier company to
do business with. We take pride in our ability to attract and retain talent, and having a
diverse and inclusive workforce with a strong ethical culture. We are consistently
recognized for leadership in these areas, including being designated the World's Most
Ethical Company for the past 10 years by Ethisphere; and a member of the Bloomberg
Gender-Equality Index for the fourth consecutive year. Recently, we were named a Best
Employer for Women by Forbes and their first ranking on gender equality.
Finally, we expect our organic capital generation to remain strong in 2019 and beyond,
which will help fund the $1 billion share repurchase authorization we announced yesterday.
Beth will discuss our approach in using the plan, but I want to emphasize that our capital
management philosophy has not changed. We remain committed to a strong balance
sheet and we'll continue to balance investing in the businesses for profitable growth with
returning excess capital to shareholders that exceed business requirements.
To conclude, 2018 was an excellent year and I'm really pleased about our operating
performance and execution mindset. We are working hard to maintain and expand the
momentum of progress and look forward to sharing the results with you.
Now, I'll turn the call over to Doug.

Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. 2018 was an excellent year for Property &
Casualty and Group Benefits. Each of our business units delivered strong underlying
financial performance, and operationally we continue to hit aggressive targets on our
major initiatives.
It was an outstanding year for Group Benefits. We're meeting or exceeding all milestones
for the Aetna integration. Sales are very strong, and we delivered a year of record core
earnings.

FINAL

In Commercial Lines, we continue to set the bar for superior customer service and
underwriting performance among small businesses. Our Middle Market industry verticals
are gaining traction. And with the acquisition of Navigators, we are poised to deepen our
relationships with customers and brokers with an expanded product suite and new
underwriting expertise.
In Personal Lines, our underlying auto results were strong and the business is better
positioned for both auto and home new business growth in 2019. This is the second year
in a row marked by severe wildfire losses and hurricane activity. Our claims team and our
entire enterprise continues to respond with care and professionalism in the aftermath of
these tragic events. However, the losses were significant to our fourth quarter results.
We continue to evolve our catastrophe risk management strategies based on the loss
events in recent years with increased focus on wildfire. This includes refinement of our
loss models, exposure limits, underwriting guidelines and risk transfer arrangements.
While we're generally pleased with how our overall book of business and risk
management program performed, given the CAT events of 2018, we will continue to
refine our wildfire and tornado/hail catastrophe underwriting approach.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let me pivot now to summarize our financial performance for 2018, and then I'll conclude
with some thoughts about 2019. Beginning with Group Benefits, we posted core earnings
for the year of $427 million, up $193 million from 2017 with a core earnings margin of 7%.
This outstanding performance relative to our outlook was due to favorable disability loss
cost trends and limited partnership income.
The group disability loss ratio for the year improved by 3.4 points due to the emergence
of favorable incident trends on the most recent accident years and, to a lesser extent,
slightly higher pricing. The group life loss ratio remains solid, but was up 1.7 points versus
prior year due mainly to a mix of larger accounts from the acquisition which carry a slightly
higher loss ratio.
Fully insured ongoing sales for 2018 were $704 million, exceeding our expectations for the
year. And persistency on our employer group block of business was stable at
approximately 90%. This was simply an outstanding result from our sales and underwriting
teams.
As I noted earlier, our integration plans are on track. Our 2019 results will include
approximately $85 million of our $120 million expense savings target. We expect to
achieve the additional expense savings as we complete the conversion of business to our
new systems.
Conversion of Middle Market and large case customers to our newly launched Ability
Advantage claims platform has commenced and will continue throughout 2019 and 2020.
The reception of our new capabilities among customers, prospects and brokers has been
overwhelmingly positive.

FINAL

In Personal Lines, results for 2018 swung to a core loss of $28 million, including
catastrophe losses of $546 million before tax or 16.1 points versus our 2018 outlook of 5.6
points. The full year underlying combined ratio which excludes catastrophes and prior year
development improved 1.8 points to 91.2, driven by better results in both home and auto.
The Personal Lines auto underlying combined ratio improved 1.5 points to 98.2 for the full
year, driven by earned rate increases and moderate loss cost trends, partially offset by
higher expenses due to increased marketing efforts.
Commercial Lines core earnings were approximately $1.2 billion for the year on a
combined ratio of 92.6. This includes catastrophe losses of $275 million or 3.9 points
versus our outlook of 2.6 points. The underlying combined ratio was 91.5 for the year,
improving 0.5 point over 2017, driven by general liability and commercial auto. The
underlying combined ratio for Standard Commercial Lines workers' compensation was
generally in line with 2017, which was a very strong result, given the competitive market
and recent loss trends.
Renewal written pricing in Standard Commercial Lines was 2.1% for the full year, down 1.1
points from 2017 driven by workers' compensation. Fourth quarter 2018 renewal written
pricing was down sequentially from third quarter, driven largely by Small Commercial
workers' compensation.

Bloomberg Transcript

Overall, I'm very pleased with how effectively our team is balancing growth and
profitability. We continue to be confident in our ability to manage workers' compensation
loss cost trends despite the slight uptick in frequency we've noted in recent quarters.
In the fourth quarter, we began to see those trends flatten. Accordingly, we made no
changes this quarter to our workers' compensation loss picks for accident year 2018. This
flattening suggests that 2018 may have been a one-time step-change as the economy
adjusts to recent growth and record employment levels.
Shifting to our other business units, Small Commercial had another outstanding year. The
underlying combined ratio was 87, improving 0.8 points from prior year. Retentions remain
strong and new business increased to $637 million for the full year, up 7%. Total written
premium increased 1%.
In Middle Market, we posted an underlying combined ratio of 96.1 for the year, essentially
flat with 2017. The slight loss ratio increase was more than offset by a lower expense ratio
and a decrease to policyholder dividends. Retentions remain solid and new business
production of $553 million was up 14% versus prior year. Total written premium increased
by 5%.
We're achieving positive results from our investments in new industry verticals and efforts
to improve our underwriting process, which allows our underwriters to focus on building a
strong new business pipeline while making appropriate risk decisions.

Company Ticker: H I G US Equity
Date: 2019-02-05

In Specialty Commercial, the underlying combined ratio was 97.5, 0.3 points lower than
2017 driven by an improved expense ratio. Total written premium was up 2%.

FINAL

In national accounts, our underlying combined ratio improved by 3 points, primarily due to
a lower expense ratio. Bond delivered consistent underwriting results and 4% written
premium growth. And in financial products, our Middle Market-centric platform delivered
strong written premium growth of 8%.
Before I turn things over to Beth, I'd like to share a few thoughts about 2019. In Group
Benefits, we remain focused on successfully converting customers to our newly deployed
Ability Advantage claims system. This platform is a distinctive capability that puts us at the
forefront in using data and analytics to better manage disability and workplace absence.
January is off to a solid start, with renewal retention and new sales on par with prior year.
For the full year, we expect the Group Benefits core earnings margin to be between 6%
and 7%.

Bloomberg Transcript

In Personal Lines, we will continue to drive new business growth in AARP Direct. For 2019,
we expect to achieve a Personal Lines combined ratio of 97.5 to 99.5, including 6.5 points
of catastrophes.
In Commercial Lines, our top priority for 2019 is the successful integration of Navigators
into our business operations to accelerate our strategy. However, my comments this
morning provide 2019 insights regarding the current Commercial business on The
Hartford. Across the marketplace, we continue to see very competitive conditions based
on line of business, geography and industry. In property, general liability and Commercial
auto, we expect renewal written pricing to be generally consistent with 2018.
In workers' compensation, we expect pricing to be flat to down modestly. With 2018
accident year frequency flattening in the fourth quarter, we believe this continues to be a
very manageable level of pricing change and while margins may compress slightly,
profitability for the line remains attractive. As a result, we expect the 2019 Commercial
Lines combined ratio to be between 94.5 and 96.5, including 3 points of catastrophes,
generally consistent with our performance for 2018.
Overall, 2018 was a strong year for all of our business units across Property & Casualty
and Group Benefits. We're a disciplined underwriting organization committed to
maintaining strong margins and seeking growth when it meets our profit targets. We
continue to effectively segment our business to determine those accounts that need
price increases to reach target margins as we balance growth and margins.
2019 represents a new and significant phase in our journey. With our acquisition of
Navigators, we are well positioned to advance the key elements of our strategy:
profitable product and underwriting expansion, deep partnerships with our distributors,
and outstanding value to our customers.
Let me now turn the call over to Beth.

FINAL

Thank you, Doug. I'm going to cover results for the investment portfolio, Hartford Funds,
and Corporate and also comment on the announced share repurchase authorization.
00:20:50
The investment portfolio continues to perform very well. Net investment income was $457
million for the quarter, up 16% from the prior year quarter. Net investment income of $1.8
billion was up 11% for the year primarily due to higher partnership income and higher
invested assets.
The increase in invested assets was driven primarily by the Group Benefits acquisition and
receipt of proceeds from the sale of Talcott Resolution. For the year, limited partnerships
generated a 13% return primarily due to strong private equity results and gains from real
estate partnerships versus our outlook of 6%.

Bloomberg Transcript

The total portfolio yield for the full year was 4%, and excluding LPs was 3.7%, both flat with
2017. During the year, the average reinvestment rate rose to 4% from 3.5% which reflects
the impact of higher interest rates. However, this increase was offset by the lower yield on
the invested assets acquired from Aetna after giving effect to the purchase accounting
requirements to record the portfolio on the acquisition date at current market yields. The
after-tax portfolio yield rose from 3% in 2017 to 3.3% in 2018, driven primarily by the
decrease in the corporate tax rate.
The credit performance of our investment portfolio remains very strong with net
impairment losses of only $1 million for the year. During the year, we repositioned the
acquired Aetna portfolio to align with our long-term portfolio model which generated a
modest amount of capital losses due to the increase in interest rates since that portfolio
was acquired.
Turning to Hartford Funds, core earnings were up 3% for the quarter and 37% for the year,
reflecting a lower corporate tax rate; and for the full year, higher average daily assets
under management. Although markets were down in the fourth quarter, our investment
performance remains strong with 68% of our funds beating peers on a five-year basis.
Given the significant market volatility in the fourth quarter and consistent with industry
trends, net flows were negative and totaled $1.7 billion. For the year, net outflows were
$300 million as mutual fund outflows of $1.7 billion were offset by ETF inflows of $1.4
billion.
The Corporate core loss was $46 million for the quarter and $233 million for the year. For
the fourth quarter, the core loss was modestly lower than the prior year due to lower
interest expense and higher net investment income. For the quarter, Talcott Resolution
did not have a significant impact on earnings since investment management fees,
transition service revenues, and income from our retained equity interest offset the cost
of providing investment management in transition services.

FINAL

Corporate net investment income totaled $26 million in the quarter. Once we close The
Navigators acquisition, pro forma quarterly corporate net investment income will decrease
by about $15 million.
At December 31, holding company resources totaled $3.4 billion, which declined to $2.9
billion at January 31 after repayment of $413 million of maturing senior notes and quarterly
dividends and interest payments. After the payment of $2.2 billion for The Navigators
acquisition, which includes transaction expenses, holding company resources will be close
to our liquidity target of 12 months projected interest and dividend expense or
approximately $700 million.
In the fourth quarter, we completed our annual asbestos and environmental reserve
review. Before session to the adverse development cover we have in place, net reserves
increased by $238 million before tax comprised of $157 million for asbestos liabilities and
$71 million for environmental.
Since inception of the adverse development cover including the impact of the 2018 study,
we have ceded losses of $523 million compared to a limit of $1.5 billion. There is
additional detail on our A&E reserves and the adverse development cover in the
appendix of the slide deck.

Bloomberg Transcript

To summarize, fourth quarter core earnings were $0.78 per diluted share, down 4% from
last year. While full year 2018 core earnings were $4.33 per diluted share, up 58%. Aside
from catastrophe losses, our actual business results were in line or better than the ranges
we provided last February.
Book value per diluted share excluding AOCI rose 12% for the year to $39.40 and our
2018 core earnings ROE was 11.6%, a strong result in light of heavy catastrophe losses for
the year. Total value creation, which includes both the change in book value per share
excluding AOCI and dividends paid to shareholders, was 15%.
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended 2018 with a debt to capital ratio ex-AOCI of
24.2%, down almost 4 points from year end 2017. Including the preferred stock we issued
in November, our debt and preferred stock to total capital ratio ex-AOCI was 25.9% and
our rating agency debt to total capital ratio was 29.2%. Our goal is to keep the debt
leverage in the low- to mid-20% range. Between the January debt repayment and the
assumption of The Navigators senior notes as part of the acquisition, we expect net debt
reduction of about $150 million in 2019.
Finally, we are pleased to announce a share repurchase authorization of $1 billion effective
through December 31, 2020. We expect to use this plan with discretion, taking into
consideration the amount of excess capital as well as the timing of future sources and
uses of holding company resources. Given our projected cash flows which were
summarized on page 7 of the slide deck, we would expect most of this program to be
utilized in 2020.

FINAL

As noted earlier, upon closing The Navigators acquisition, holding company resources will
be close to our liquidity targets. As holding company resources build in 2019 from
subsidiary dividends, utilization of NOLs, and AMT refunds, we will have some flexibility to
utilize a portion of the authorization this year.
To wrap up, 2018 was an excellent year for The Hartford despite high catastrophe losses.
In addition to posting strong financial results, we achieved important operational and
strategic goals including the sale of Talcott and a smooth integration of the Aetna book of
business.
In 2019, we are focused on continuing our momentum with a goal of maintaining and
improving, where possible, strong margins and top line growth. We are intently focused
on maximizing the potential of our two acquisitions, in Group Benefits and with Navigators,
and are excited about the opportunities we see to continue to build and strengthen our
position as a leading property/casualty and group benefits insurance company.
I'll now turn the call over to Sabra so we can begin the Q&A session.

Sabra Rose Purtill

{BIO 1764408 <GO>}

Thank you. We have about 30 minutes for questions today. Shelby, can you please repeat
the instructions for asking a question?

Bloomberg Transcript

Q&A
Operator
Of course. Your first question comes from Brian Meredith of UBS.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yeah, thanks. A couple quick questions here for you. First, I'm just curious, your
Commercial auto results are much better than the rest of the industry. Do you think that
has something to do with like mix of business? Why do you think that is why others are
seeing some issues with it right now?

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Brian, so Commercial auto has been a focus of ours for – Chris and I talked last night – at
least five years. We had some signs in our book five, six years ago that were not
acceptable to us, so we worked on closing down some programs. We've been working
rate hard.
Again, our Commercial auto book is largely the complement to our Middle Market
strategy in Small Commercial, so it has been a core priority of ours. Keep in mind we're
still not pleased and don't think we have reached the end zone on where our returns are
today in Commercial auto, but they are much improved from where they were a couple

Page 10 of 25

years ago, and we'll continue to work at the line. As we close up 2018, I feel very satisfied
and confident in our reserve calls on the prior years.

FINAL

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great. And then, if I take a look at your outlook for the underlying Commercial combined
ratio here going forward, you mentioned you're factoring into deterioration on workers'
comp. Any offsets there that we could be thinking of ? Like, in the general liability or
improvement in Commercial auto, how should we be thinking about how your book
should play out here?

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Yeah, that's a good question. So, yes, we expect some margin compression in comp, but
we also think that we're going to see improved results across general liability, property,
and again, we're going to work rate and we think we can improve our auto book as well.
So, rate and underwriting attacking those three other lines, I think we're going to see an
improved number for performance in 2019. And I think that will offset some of the
workers' comp compression.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great. Thank you.

Operator

Bloomberg Transcript

Your next question comes from Ryan Tunis of Autonomous Research.

Q - Ryan J. Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Hey, thanks. Good morning. I just had a couple for Beth. The first one is looking at stat
earnings and sources for dividends over the next couple years. It looks like really strong
stat earnings here. Should we think about – if you have another, like, $400 million of stat
earnings in Group Benefits, $1.1 billion in P&C, that's higher than what you've guided to for
divvies. Does all of that translate to the higher dividend in the holdco income over the
next couple years or would some of that upside be held in the subs? I'm just trying to
understand how that maps to what could be deployable.

A - Beth Ann Bombara-Costello
Yeah, that's a great question. So when we do our projections for dividend to the holding
company, we do tend to look at sort of over the long-term what we've seen from a
performance perspective so that we have a strong degree of confidence that even if
business activities are a little different from our outlook that those dividends can still come
to the holding company.
So, over time, if we see those businesses performing strongly, we could expect to see
increase in dividends in outer years. But we try and go into our planning period, putting
some degree of – looking at just kind of historically what we've seen there.

Q - Ryan J. Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

FINAL

Got it. And then just trying to get a better feel for the run rate in Corporate once you've
closed the acquisition. I think you said the net investment income is going to come down a
decent clip, but I would think there might be some other positive offsets to that. I mean is
there any way you can help me in terms of...

A - Beth Ann Bombara-Costello
Yeah.

Q - Ryan J. Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

... what the run rate is once we're done with this?

A - Beth Ann Bombara-Costello

Bloomberg Transcript

Sure. Yeah, it can be a little complicated when you look at the line item by line item view
of Corporate. But I think if you step back from it, there's really two primary drivers of our
results in Corporate. The first is going to be interest expense after-tax and our preferred
dividend. So if you look at 2019, we'd expect that to be about $230 million and you'd
expect to see that pretty ratable over the four quarters.
And then, on investment income, it's really going to be a function of just what cash we
have at the holding company. So, again, right now it's a little elevated. I'd expect that to
come down, and we're probably more in the $10 million to $15 million range for
investment income. And those are really the two primary drivers of what you see in
Corporate.
There obviously is other activities as it relates to the investment management fees that
we get from managing the assets of Talcott, but those are pretty much offset by the cost
of performing those services. So there's not a lot that drops to the bottom line on that.
And then, the last item I'd point to is obviously we'll be picking up our share of our interest
in Talcott, the 9.7% ownership that we have. And then, obviously, that can vary. So when I
put all that together and you sort of look through it kind of getting to a more normalized
run rate on investment income, you're looking at a loss per quarter in the $45 million to
$50 million range.

Hi. Good morning. My first question going back to the Commercial Lines outlook for the
coming year, and then just trying to drill down a little bit more into the commentary on
comp. So sounds like you guys are expecting stable frequency trends, continuation of
what you saw in the fourth quarter. And so, can you just expand, is that something you
expect within both the Small Commercial and the Middle Market books? And were the
trends more or less in line within both of those books in the fourth quarter?

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Elyse, improvement in frequency in both Middle and Small in the fourth quarter and very
stable. So pleased about that and we're expecting that to continue into 2019. So I think
you've got a fair summary of what we see moving out relative to frequency.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. And then, what should we, from the outside, pay attention to? What do you think it
would take for frequency trends to turn negative again? Or is it just kind of more or less
paying attention to any changes in the unemployment rates?

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, we're spending a lot of time paying attention to unemployment for sure. We're
watching job growth. We're watching all the economic indicators, including sales. As we
look out, we're obviously managing our book of business by territory, et cetera, by class.
We're looking for high-growth industries. We're being very careful about how we price
forward. So I think the general categories that I talked about in the third quarter call are all
key areas that we're focused on.
We're also spending a lot of time in our claim group making sure that we're doing
everything possible with nurse case managers managing major medical, our managed
care networks. We're spending a lot of time because we think we have been able to bend
the curve. We think our durations in comp are top of market and the combination of sound
underwriting and excellence in claims, I think, is a really good formula for us to compete
moving forward.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay, great. And then, my second question is related to capital. The disclosure in the
slides is very helpful. Beth, in terms of the cash tax receipts at $600 million to $700
million, seems like that's going to be a big driver of capital to the holdco to finance what
you might repurchase in 2019. Could you give us a sense of timing there?
And then, I think you said in your prepared remarks that you guys are now looking to keep
about 1 time interest in dividends at the holdco. I thought in the past that was 1 to 1.5
times. So you guys are okay going forward kind of keeping that at about 1 time?

A - Beth Ann Bombara-Costello
Yeah. So, great, I'll take both of those questions. So on the tax receipts in 2019, they're
coming from two sources. One would be a refund that we're due relative to our AMT
Page 13 of 25

FINAL

credits, and those we'll receive shortly after we file our tax return. So we typically file our
tax return in the third quarter. We'll obviously look to see if there's things that we can do
to speed that process up, but that's dependent on that.
And then the NOLs, the way that that works through our tax sharing arrangements with
the subsidiaries is we true-up quarterly kind of where we are vis-à-vis estimates of taxable
income. So there's a source of cash flow that's kind of coming in each quarter related to
that. And when you think about the projection that we have for tax receipts that we
shared, I'd say a little bit more than half of that is from NOLs, with the remainder coming
from AMT.
And then, for holding company resources, yes, in the past we've talked about 1 to 1.5
times. We've been grading down to 1 time as sort of the risk profile of the company itself
has changed. And so, again, that's a target. It's not an absolute amount, but we feel
comfortable being able to maintain holding company liquidity there as we sort of assess
all of our access to liquidity across the company.

Q - Michael Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Hey. Good morning. First question is a follow-up to Brian's question about underlying
Commercial margins. Were non-catastrophe losses materially above or below
expectations for the full year 2018? If they were, could you offer some quantification?

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Let me take that, Mike. For the year, our non-CAT losses in property were pretty much on
our expectations. I would say, in our Middle Market business, slightly elevated to our
normal patterns. So, something that's got our attention, but nothing more than that. And
in Small Commercial, we had a very good year.

Q - Michael Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Okay. Great. Thanks, Doug. And then, a follow-up for Beth on investment income
excluding limited partnership returns. And thanks for all the color on the call so far about
the Corporate segment. But my question is, if I look at the new money reinvestment rate,
it ticked up 30 basis points this quarter, and I was curious if that's sustainable into 2019?

A - Beth Ann Bombara-Costello
And I'm assuming your question is on overall portfolio yield not just in Corporate, but as
we look at where we ended the year and what our yield was on an ex-partnership basis
before tax for 2018, we'd expect to see maybe some increase to that as we go into 2019.

Your next question comes from Tom Gallagher of Evercore.

Q - Thomas Gallagher

{BIO 3311667 <GO>}

Good morning. Hey, Doug. I just want to be clear that I understand your comments on
workers' comp frequency. I think you said they flattened out in 4Q. So, does that imply
that they recovered from the elevated levels from 3Q, or were they consistent with 3Q
levels?

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, I'm sorry, let me be very specific. The fourth quarter compare which did flatten out,
so I'm talking zero, would have been a compare to fourth quarter 2017, okay? Every time
we do our quarterly compares, we're looking at same quarter last year. So, that would
have been an improvement over the prior several quarters where we had positive
frequency change, meaning more workers' compensation claim losses in the quarters
compared to the same quarter prior year.

Q - Thomas Gallagher

{BIO 3311667 <GO>}

Gotcha. So, from what you can see, it does look like that was a temporary increase, and
now you think it's more likely to trend where it's recovered to in 4Q?

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Our thought process that we have shared externally is that it looked to us like 2018 was
going to be a bit of a step change. 2017 was a terrific year, maybe the best year we've
seen in quite some time in comp. The absolute level now that we expect moving forward
probably looks more like 2016 than 2017. But at this point, we don't see something further
deteriorating from the earlier part of the year. And we're watching the economy, as I said
before, very closely.

Q - Thomas Gallagher

{BIO 3311667 <GO>}

Gotcha. And then, my follow-up is just on Group Benefits. I'm not sure if I caught this
correctly, but I thought I heard you say Group Benefits sales were strong in the quarter,
and I noticed they were down a lot year-over-year. So, I just want to know what you meant
by that.

Yeah, I was really referring, Tom, to the full year. We felt very good about the full year. As
you know, a lot of the Group Benefit sales are – they lean into the first half of the year.

Q - Thomas Gallagher

{BIO 3311667 <GO>}

FINAL

Right.

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

So, I felt very good about the overall effort, particularly with our Aetna book.
And then, I did comment further about the beginning of 2019 which we feel pretty good
about. And when I say pretty good, we've had some nice successes. We had a Paid Family
Leave at new case that came on all 1/1/18. So, when I adjust for that and I look at our core
disability and our core life sales, I feel very good about 2019.

A - Beth Ann Bombara-Costello
I think the only thing I'd add to that, Doug, is when you look at the year-over-year
compare for the quarter, in the prior year, we had a very strong one case sale that
skewed the result when you look at it sort of year-over-year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Thomas Gallagher

{BIO 3311667 <GO>}

But as you – and thanks for that color. And I guess, as you think about momentum for top
line, though, would you say it's a good setup for sales persistency? And also, I'd be
curious what you're seeing on rate only because your results have been so strong, I'm
wondering if you have to give back something on price right now.

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

So, many of our accounts are rated on their own experience, experience-based. So, it
really is a case-by-case answer for much of our national account book. But let me just step
back. We feel really good about these last 15 months as it pertains to how the Aetna book
has combined, the talent, the ability for us now to stand up a very different unique claims
platform.
So, yeah, I'm feeling very bullish about our ability to compete in the marketplace. There
are situations where we're giving back a little bit of rate because of the performance.
There are also some cases that need a little bit more rate, and we have been able to
achieve that. So, I think a really strong year in 2018 and off to a good start in 2019.

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Tom, I would just add from your top line orientation, remember we've built over the last
three years a voluntary capability. We've added some new A&H products and refreshed
some old one. We're doing things differently and creatively with some distribution
relationships on the A&H side. So, we still think there's a momentum and upside potential
from here.

But it is a competitive marketplace, as you well know. There's a lot of good competitors
out there. But I think the agents and brokers we deal with and the clients recognize that
we've really upped our game. And we're seeing opportunities, particularly in the large
case side, we wouldn't have seen years ago. So, you put it all together, particularly how
the models and how actual results are performing compared to our purchase
expectations, it's been rock solid.

growth strains in the Personal Lines side and just, is there sort of an arc where we can see
some of that strain reduced and the timing of that?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Well, let me give you some color. So, as I think about our return to growth in Personal
Lines, number one, we're very pleased with the progress on the profitability front. Our
new sales in Personal Lines were up, as you can see in the chart, materially from last year.
We expect more of that moving forward. Our direct AARP auto sales in the fourth quarter
new to new 4Q to 4Q were up roughly 24%. I expect more quarters like that as we move
into next year.
So, we're working hard as more and more of our territories are rate adequate to
compete in the marketplace appropriately, and I think that continued trend is within our
sights and certainly expectations for 2019.

[Navigators] acquisition; Navigator (sic) [Navigators] historically having higher combined
ratio than Hartford's. So I just wonder would that be dilutive to your like combined ratio

Page 17 of 25



Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The

going forward? And what's your plan in that $200 million earnings target in 4 to 5 years,
included some improvements in underwriting at Navigators?

FINAL

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yeah, Kai, thank you for the question. So, you are right. It doesn't include it. Think we've
been pretty clear, Beth and I and Doug, that once that we close, we will update our
guidance.
So, as we think about the $200 million of incremental core earnings before amortization
and intangibles, I think we've laid out a path and a track that we've talked about before in
that, basically, 50% of that incremental increase will come from investment income and
expense saves. A quarter of that incremental increase will come from what I would just
describe as profit improvement opportunities in their book of business. And the other
quarter would come then from synergies, cross-sell activities, of how we would go to the
marketplace.

Bloomberg Transcript

I would share, and then Doug can add his color, that obviously he's announced the
operating model and the organizational structure. But doing all of that work, getting to
know The Navigators team both domestically and internationally, we've made trips there,
going back this weekend to London. I'm coming away more and more impressed with the
talent, the skills, the deep underwriting knowledge they have in the organization.
And I think as a – just as a larger company, I think we can bring them more capabilities
from the technology side, as a management routine side, while still being entrepreneurial,
while still having a distributed decision-making model. So, I feel even more confident that
this is going to fit like hand in glove going forward, Kai.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

That's great. Then in the past you've been providing the P&C net investment income
guidance as well as core earnings for Group Benefits. Any insight you can provide there?

A - Beth Ann Bombara-Costello
Yes. So, on Group Benefits, I'll start with that. Actually, our practice has typically been to
show margins. Last year, we did earnings just because with the Aetna acquisition, we felt
that it would be clearer just to give an earnings target rather than a margin. So, we actually
returned for Group Benefits to our normal practice.
And then, for P&C investment income, we concluded that just hasn't been an area of – an
area that we needed to highlight that I think people's models are pretty consistent on
that. And as I answered previously, as we look at investment returns kind of expartnerships, we'd expect a yield to be maybe slightly above last year. And then, again, as
a reminder, when we think about yield on partnerships, we budget sort of assuming a
long-term view of around a 6% yield. Obviously, we're much higher than that this year but
we would not project that in the subsequent year.

I'm sorry. Your next question comes from Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Hey, good morning, everybody. Looking at the guidance on the Personal Lines side from
where it was a year ago, it's deteriorated a little bit. And if I look at auto over the last
three years, it seems like you've had 28% rate increases. I'm kind of surprised, given now
that some of your competitors are reporting declines in frequency or whatnot, that the
combined ratio isn't better at this point in time. Do you have any thoughts there?
And also, if you can talk about the change in the catastrophe outlook. You obviously have
a higher CAT loss ratio than you did a year ago. Has anything changed about the
underwriting, or are you just like saying, look, there's a lot more losses out there it feels
these days?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Josh, okay, let me take them in each of the pieces, and then Beth and Chris can come
over the top. So, relative to Personal Lines, all-in in Personal Lines, the first thing I would
say is that it really was an outstanding non-CAT homeowners year. So, our performance
far exceeded, really, the last three years, five years, et cetera. So, as we think about that
moving forward, our pick on homeowners was a longer-term view which wasn't quite as
positive as the outstanding year in 2018 that we had.
Relative to auto, we're watching the line. As you know, we've worked hard at that line over
time. We're also spending more dollars on the marketing side. So, you're seeing a little bit
of expense move there that is direct and something that we want to do to stimulate new
sales. So, we're very sensitive to where the overall performance of the line is, feel very
solid about our picks for accident year 2018 and 2017. So, I think we're in a good spot. But
as we move into 2019, you're going to feel a little marketing and then we'll watch how
pricing and loss trend move together.
I would note that others, and including industry data, have seen a little pickup in collision,
collision severity. So it's something that we're watchful of. Our book isn't demonstrating
the trends that fast track data is showing, but we're clearly watching that carefully as
things like new bumpers and headlights, the replacement of those parts, I think, is starting
to kind of work its way into loss trend in Personal Lines auto.

FINAL

Josh, and just again, between Beth and myself, we're looking hard at our historical
catastrophe numbers over the last 10 years, 5 years in particular. And we decided to make
an adjustment because I think the trends were sort of undeniable, particularly from not
only wildfire which created all the attention the last two years but winter storm activity,
tornado, hail, particularly hail patterns moving, which I describe in a non-meteorological
sense, eastward away from mountains more and more. So we did make a slight
adjustment. I think that translates into roughly $50 million pre-tax.
But, again, I think that the patterns are there. We adjust to it. I think it's more realistic. And,
ultimately, we need to begin to price for it and collect the cash from the policyholders. But
as you know, regulators have a say in that. So it will be baked into our pricing models
going forward. And then, it's a matter of trying to collect from policyholders over a longer
period of time.

Your next question comes from Yaron Kinar of Goldman Sachs.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Good morning. Chris, in your opening comments you said that you were expecting a bit of
a slowdown in the U.S. economy in 2019. How does that factor into your Commercial
margin expectations in general and to workers' comp in particular?

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

It's a great question. As Doug described, I think it does take some of the pressure off of
frequency. Again, I think the analysis that we've done in here as it relates to tax benefits,
economic demand, unemployment, I think we've pulled a lot of economic activity forward
with the stimulus. And I think that created a surge of workers, particularly new and
inexperienced workers in certain industries and I think, in a strange sense, a slight
slowdown.
We still see positive GDP in the 2%, 2.25% range. I'm looking at Brion Johnson, our Head
of HIMCO. And so, I think that takes some pressure off. If Doug didn't say it, I mean, we
still are always going to be conservative with our severity picks in putting up long-term
trends on medical severity in particular. So we think that's generally unchanged by
economic activity and sort of separate.
But, Doug, what would you add?

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

So maybe as I think about adding something and the earlier questions, maybe an
example that just came across my desk a couple of days ago of what – when I talk about
increased economic activity and sometimes the pressure that puts on workers' comp, I
saw a claim come across. Essentially, it was a manufacturing client we've had for many
years. Their demand to produce product has grown substantially in the last nine months.
So they took a piece of equipment that have been offline for five to seven years, put it
back online and the third day it was in service, not noticing that the safety guard was not
attached. We had a major hand/arm accident with a worker. And that's the kind of claim –
that piece of equipment was not in use during, what I would say, level demand times of
the last three to five years. And now with – in certain sectors, a little bit of needed
increase in output, we have a loss that we might not have had last year or the year
before. That's just a little example of why we're watching this economic activity so
carefully.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Thank you. That's helpful. And then, maybe a follow-up to your answer to Josh's question
on catastrophes. I did note that you reduced the limit per occurrence, but also reduced
the attachment point for aggregate. Does that just – as you're looking at your CAT loss
experience over the last couple of years, does that just signify that you're expecting
maybe more of a frequency uptick and not necessarily a deterioration in severity per
occurrence?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yeah. I think your observations are right. I think if you look at our pattern, I think it was two,
three years ago, Beth, we added an aggregate protection in a more material, meaningful
way to protect on multiple occurrences as opposed to just one big one. So when we think
about spend and trying to maximize coverage on a power versus aggregate cover, we
spent a little bit more on an aggregate. So, again, I would say it's a modest change,
nothing major, Beth, but would you add any color?

A - Beth Ann Bombara-Costello
No, I'd agree with that. One thing to keep in mind is the layer on our per occurrence treaty
that we eliminated was a layer that used to be able to go between either the per
occurrence treaty or the aggregate. And really all we've done is now put it into the
aggregate and increase the aggregate protection by another $25 million from what we
had before. So, really, again and to your point, as we look at our experience and where
we see the potential for protection, we felt that that was a better use of our dollars.

FINAL

Thanks for fitting me in. Two quick follow-ups. Number one, just going back to the
workers' comp comments. Net-net, I think what you're saying is that 2018 might have
been a blip and the underlying CR uptick is due to the pressure on the pricing side of the
equation. Can you just maybe expand on the level of pricing on comp? Maybe give us
some color. And then, talk about pricing expectations in 2019?

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Sure. Let me provide a little color. And I think the exposure in the loss trend piece you
have, exactly on, right? We see stability moving out ahead, watchful and not moving off
our long-term medical severity picks, but a flattening frequency.
Relative to pricing, as I said in my script, I see pricing workers' comp flat to down. I think
we're going to see a little more downward pressure on Small Commercial, where we
don't have the underwriting ability to deviate based on account experiences, much more
group rated. So we're going to see a little more pressure, minus single digits, small-single
digits, mid-single digits in Small Commercial.
And then, in Middle Market, it's going to be a risk-by-risk evaluation. And, again, we see
quite a bit of competition in the industry, but I see that pricing being flat to down a couple
points as well.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Got it. That's helpful. The only other question, I will end here, is I know this is early days on
the buyback discussion. But is there any thought process based on where the stock has
traded over the past few years? Would there be any desire – let's say, if we get down to
end of 2019and early 2020, could there be a possibility this buyback could be frontloaded? Or am I getting ahead of myself ? Or this is going to be spread out over 2020?
Thanks.

A - Christopher J. Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yeah. I think it's probably premature to speculate on trading practices. I think Beth – and
we've been clear – historically, we've have done things on a pro rata basis, but I think with
this program and the intention to sort of foreshadow two years of demand, we'd rather
be just a little bit more opportunistic when we see opportunities, particularly as we get
into later 2019.
It's not without – it's feasible, we could be active sooner, but we have obviously funding
requirements and we've got holding company liquidity targets that we like to maintain, so
– but as we get into later half of 2019 and into 2020, I think we'll be much more
opportunistic in buying patterns as opposed to anything front loaded in a large program,
a one-time buying opportunity or anything more mechanical. So, just expect us to be
more opportunistic going forward.

prior accident year. So, as we go quarter by quarter, Beth and I and our team actuaries sit
down, and those calls, we think, were appropriate given what we saw coming out of the
prior year. So, we feel very good about our positions in all our booked accident years.

Bloomberg Transcript

Relative to GL, we've seen a little bit of product liability adverse experience in the last
couple years. So, we're watchful of that, but the moves in GL for prior have largely been in
the product liability area.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. Can you give us a sense as to the accident years?

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Say that again. I'm sorry.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Which accident years?

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

Yeah. On the workers' comp, we're talking about the last four accident years, right, 2014,
2015, 2016. I'd have to go back and check on the GL.

A - Beth Ann Bombara-Costello
GL I think is on, I believe, is probably coming from the 2015 accident year.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. Fantastic. Thank you so much.

Your final question comes from Jimmy Bhullar of JPMorgan.

FINAL

Q - Jamminder Singh Bhullar
Hi. Good morning. So, most of my questions were answered. Just maybe a couple. On
M&A, are you still interested in pursuing acquisitions once The Navigator (sic) [The
Navigators] (01:02:48) deal closes? Or – and if yes, what sort of product lines or regions
are the most interest?

A - Christopher J. Swif t

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, thanks for the question, Jimmy. I would say, again, in the context of how we have
talked about excess capital, obviously, we've said what we want to do with our excess
which is authorizing a share repurchase. We are in the final stages of integrating the Aetna
book of business during 2019, so there's still more substantive work to do there. And we
haven't even closed The Navigators acquisition, which we are expecting to close in March
or April. So, I think from a practical point, as I said, I mean, we have everything we need at
least for the foreseeable future.
And who knows what would happen down the road, but we wouldn't take M&A off the
table per se, but if something attractive that fits within our existing strategy, sort of like a
foremost deal or another small bolt-on opportunity, we would look at it, but it would have
to make more financial sense going forward. So, that's what I would say. I mean, it's not a
current focus. It's not a current priority. We have higher priorities that we need to really
focus on the next 18 to 24 months. But we'll see what things look like in two years.

Q - Jamminder Singh Bhullar
Okay. And then just lastly, on Group Benefits, your margins over the last couple of
quarters have been pretty strong. I think the rest of the industry has seen a similar trend
as well. As you went through renewal season for 2019, what was just a few comments on
what you've seen in terms of pricing in that market?

A - Douglas G. Elliot

{BIO 3700927 <GO>}

It's been a pretty consistent market. It will move by account. So, yes, we've had a couple
accounts with outstanding performance, and I think we've made reductions thoughtfully.
But generally, I think it's a similar consistent market to what we've experienced over the
last 12 to 15 months.

Q - Jamminder Singh Bhullar
Okay. Thank you.

Operator
There are no other questions in the queue.
