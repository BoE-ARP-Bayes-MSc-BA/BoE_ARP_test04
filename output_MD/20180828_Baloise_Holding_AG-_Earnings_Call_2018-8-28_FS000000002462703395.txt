FINAL

Thank you, Marc. Good morning, everybody, also from my side or from our side. For
about two years at the Investor Day in October 2016, we launched our Simply Safe
strategy. Simply stands for making things much easier for our customers and our partners
in terms of products, processes and communication, and Safe stands for going beyond
insurance, working at – in alternative business models in order to make our customers
more safe.
The business philosophy of Simply Safe is that highly motivated employees generate very
satisﬁed clients and that this brings success and growth. These are also the three goals we
set forward to reach by 2021, cash CHF 2 billion, 1 million new customers and one of the
most successful employers.
Our Simply Safe strategy is on its way. We're very conﬁdent we are getting there and
that's also – we can also actually observe that in this half-year results. We conﬁrm our
strengths, and we progress very well in terms of the strategic intents and objectives. A
personal note, it has never been so exciting to work together with all the colleagues in
Bâloise in this time of change and innovation.

Bloomberg Transcript

So we are very satisﬁed with the 2018 half-year results. Very solid P&L from CHF 270
million. We're growing in the strategic important non-life segment, and we keep our
combined ratio at a very solid level. Our capital strength is huge, also conﬁrmed by
Standard & Poor's with a rating upgrade to A+ with stable outlook.
Germany for the ﬁrst time is in the band of the combined ratio that we want, which is 96%
to 98%. And as I already said, the innovation, energy and dynamics are huge at Bâloise
every month. We release a new innovative insurance solution or we make a partnership or
we invest in things. And I think to be honest and to be quite clear, Simply Safe is really –
we're actually addressing, anticipating the challenges of the future with our Simply Safe
strategy.
Having said that, I would like to hand over to questions, and we would be very glad to
answer them.

Q&A
Operator
The ﬁrst question from the phone comes from the line of Peter Eliot with Kepler
Cheuvreux. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thanks very much. The ﬁrst question, I guess, was on earnings. And you've
acknowledged, I think, before the guidance that you've given before in the life earnings
that's listed out of date. I'm just wondering if you're in any better position to update us on
that after another half year of very good results but that's for the life division.

Page 2 of 16

And I guess, the non-life, the prior year development was 5.5% when you strip out the
reserve strengthening you did in the medical malpractice. So I'm just wondering whether
that's a sustainable level because it wasn't far oﬀ what you had last year.

FINAL

And the second question, Gert, you commented in an interview recently that it's really all
about cash ﬂows rather earnings now. So I'm just wondering if is there any an update you
can give us on the cash ﬂows in 2018 or what we should expect.
And ﬁnally, I guess, when we look at the capital and solvency – a number of other
insurance companies have given us guidance on target ranges and on what they consider
to be an appropriate capital structure. I'm just wondering whether you can give us any
comments there on what you think Bâloise should look like and at what point, if you can't
comment speciﬁcally so at what point we might get that addressed in the future. Thank
you very much.

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Peter. I'll try to answer the ﬁrst two questions and Carsten will take the third
question on capital and solvency position. If you look at our life earnings, well, the interest
environment has, of course, become more stable in 2018. And that's why, we did not have
to reserve as much as in the previous years and even some releases were possible
because there were substantial reserving in the past.
Underlying, I think, the CHF 200 million guidance we gave at the Investors Day in 2016
were always meant to be a sort of a bottom – not – hitting the bottom actually. So given
the diﬃcult interesting environment that was actually the CHF 200 million we put forward.
If you look at today, I think and if you look at last year, we achieved in 2017 an EBIT of
around CHF 300 million in life, that would be I would say the expectation also going
forward.
If you look at the non-life in the reserve release, of course, a lot of that was also triggered
by the reserving in Germans or the medical practice. So I think we don't observe any
particularity. So we think it's a very stable portfolio and also moving forward. If you look at
the cash update, we don't give indeed updates on our three targets half year. We always
take into account the seasonality. So we do that on a yearly basis. But we are very
conﬁdent that we will actually reach the CHF 2 billion cash by 2021, and that we will be
again at a run rate in 2018 of slightly over CHF 400 million.
For the third question, I'll hand over to Carsten.

A - Carsten Stolz

{BIO 6055047 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you, Peter, for your question regarding capital. We have given the last SST
quota and a context of the full-year results 2017 where we've been at 262%. I think largely
we're still in the blue zone with regard to that yet. We need to know that we are on the
way to the standard model especially in the Swiss SST model in context both for the
individual entities, as well as for the group, and therefore, we haven't the model as well as

Page 3 of 16



Company Name: Baloise Holding AG
Company Ticker: BALN SW Equity
Date: 2018-08-28

the calibration yet. We don't know exactly where these numbers will turn up, which is
something that holds true for the entire industry.

FINAL

So we still have model volatility. But given where we are and given how we are steering
the ﬁrm, SST currently is not a limiting factor with regard to distribution considerations.
And Gert already alluded to the CHF 2 billion which can go into investments into the
future into dividends and share buybacks. So, on that end, SST is not a limiting factor.
And we'll continue with our considerations both on the dividend side as well as the
execution on the share buyback. More to come, I think, in the context of next year's SST
reporting when we will then by deﬁnition report under whatever FINMA considers to be
the appropriate framework by then.

A - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much. Are you able to comment on your capital structure at all or in
terms of your use of debt type, et cetera?

A - Carsten Stolz

{BIO 6055047 <GO>}

No, the capital structure at the moment is as it is. And I think we're going to have a senior
debt bond becoming due in spring next year. But, basically, on the capital side, we have
pretty much all options available and full ﬂexibility.

A - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

Operator
The next question from the phone comes from the line of Michael Huttner with JPMorgan.
Please go ahead, sir

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Thank you. And I had lots of questions, but one remark which you gave in your comments,
there's now huge capital strength. That doesn't – it seems to be diﬀerent from what's – the
way you answer the questions just before for Peter Eliot, which was very cautious and
guarded in saying we're just on track really. Don't worry, but things are ﬁne. And then
suddenly, you say huge capital strength, and I'm kind of thinking are these two diﬀerent
companies? So, I just wondered if you could comment on that and say this huge capital
strength, how will it beneﬁt shareholders because it's not obvious to me at the moment.
So this is my ﬁrst question.
And the others are more detailed. In terms of the German reserving, so we've had
negative surprises in this year and, I think, last year as well and maybe the year before,
which costs I think somewhere between CHF 80 million and CHF 100 million. I just
wondered how much more there is to come. Clearly, it's harder to close oﬀ these one-oﬀ
portfolios than I thought.

FINAL

The second is on digital. So, clearly, you're investing a lot and that's a good thing and
you're growing a portfolio. Just wondered if you could share your views on the payback of
these investments, how quickly these investments will actually lead to proﬁt for
shareholders? On the life side, there's reserve release of, I don't know, CHF 28 million or
CHF 29 million, and I just wondered if you could say where it was and where the ﬂexibility
is going forward and how much these various buckets you have could release more?
And ﬁnally and this is more personal obsession of mine. Maybe you could touch on the
trends in motor insurance. I think that's what Peter Eliot was asking in terms of the big
underlying reserve release exceed the German addition and how you see the motor
trends developing and the reserve releases and bodily injury claims or whatever. I'm sorry
for such a big catalog of questions. It's just that it's such a good opportunity. Thank you.

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

We'll try to pick all of these questions up, Michael.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Thank you.

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I'll hand over – the ﬁrst one was again about the capital strength and you're being a bit
confused with the message we were sending out. So I'll hand over to Carsten again to
give a more precise answer.

A - Carsten Stolz

{BIO 6055047 <GO>}

No, Michael, thank you. I didn't want to confuse by no means. Maybe I had to warm up a
little bit in speaking. No, but beyond – I say this with a twinkle in my eyes, the capital
strength we have is unquestioned. We have on the back of the capital strength also
received the raise in Standard & Poor's rating to A+ with stable outlook. And when I was
referring to capital strength, then I link this to basically two angles.
One is the internal view with regard to our ability to upstream cash from the operations,
cash being capital and stemming from the earnings power we have, and therefore,
delivering on what Gert said in the beginning on the CHF 2 billion cash target. So that's
one angle that I link our capital strength to.
And the second is if I look at the capital position we have in many frameworks, the S&P
framework, the SST framework and so on, nowhere capital is a binding restriction for
thought. That's why I allowed myself to talk about huge capital strength. But maybe I
shouldn't have used the adjective huge.
I just wanted to make one word of caution because of the ongoing substantial modeling
eﬀorts going on in in big building blocks of our balance sheet and business portfolio. And
that's why, I was cautious on that side because until we haven't received the binding
instructions from FINMA on how to go about it, we don't know what the outcome will be

FINAL

and the ﬁeld test conversations to us and calibration considerations from the regulator are
still going on. And obviously, this is ultimately in their full duty and they will decide about
it. Yes, I have no doubt that whatever comes out, everything I have said before will more
or less be remained unchanged. So I hope that puts into perspective the tone of my voice
and maybe the adjective I have used.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Maybe I'll jump on to Germany and the question about Germany and reserving levels.
Last year, we were indeed hitting the medical liability by a number of huge large claims.
We have analyzed the reserving level in Germany not only for that portfolio, but for the
whole portfolio intensively, internally and externally. And at this point in time, we assure
that we are reserved appropriately.

Bloomberg Transcript

Of course, if you zoom in on the on the medical liability, this is a long-term portfolio and
you can never exclude that there are still levels there will be some volatility in this
portfolio, but we have put it actually in the run-oﬀ unit on the group level where we have
the necessary expertise so that the management in Germany can concentrate on
executing the strategy as we explained in October 2016 at the Investors Day.
And digital initiatives, what's your third question, Michael? Indeed, you see every month a
new innovative solution, a partnership, or an investment coming up. So we're in a very
high dynamic of innovation in digital initiatives. Of course, all these diﬀerent initiatives
have to come to maturity. So it's still a bit early to say, hey, what have they really brought
from a ﬁnancial point of view especially also because a lot of cross-selling with the core of
the business happens with this new initiative.
What we can say is that we're winning new customers with these initiatives everywhere.
We have Friday, the mobile insurer in Berlin, 2017, over 15,000 customers. We have our
younGo suite in Switzerland which is a particular insurance suite for younger people
which has generated over more than 10,000 new customers over the last 12 months. We
have our single-unit insurance also in Switzerland, with more than 15,000 customers won
over the last six months and the growth rate per week is actually increasing. So in terms of
winning new customers and developing them into our A and B customers, the strategy is
working with the digital initiatives. Reserve release in life was I think also a question.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Yes, please.

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Yeah. The interest environment, as I said, has stabilized in the ﬁrst half year of 2018. In the
past years, we have reserved quite a lot, so we have substantially strengthened our life
reserves. And with a stable interest environment or even a slowly rising interest

Date: 2018-08-28

FINAL

environment, we can actually release some of the reserves we've built in the past. So
increasing interest rates are positive for us from a reserve release in life from a P&L, from
an investment point of view. So actually, Belgium has been the country where we have
released quite some reserves. But, on the other hand, we have strengthened reserves in
Switzerland. So it's always give and take. Net, it has inﬂuenced the EBIT in life by CHF 38
million positive.
And then, your last question was on motor insurance and trends. Stable, I would say, for
what you see is that frequency is stable. If you look at the larger claims with all the safety
devices in the cars and so forth actually go down a bit. And our releasing reserves has
been over the last years at the rate of 2%, 3% per year, and we believe that this is
sustainable and going forward.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

And just on the last point on motors, so large bodily injury claims coming down and
implicitly because it sounds like the smaller parking claims are going up. Is that net
positive?

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. The net is more or less stable, I would say, because you're right. In terms of physical
injury, actually, with all the safety devices, they go down. So that's positive from a general
point of view. But as cars become more and more sophisticated, even the small damages
actually cost a bit more. So they equal out a bit. So the good news is that the bodily
injuries go down.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

And what proportion of your portfolio is bodily injuries and what proportion is damage? I
can see the data from various countries completely diﬀerent. I was looking into Italy. Italy
is 80% MTPL. It looks like Scandinavia is 80% own damage. And I just wondered what it is
for your portfolio, which is Switzerland, Belgium, and Germany.

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Let me hand that question over to Marc Kaiser, Michael.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Thank you.

A - Marc Kaiser

{BIO 15056036 <GO>}

The next question from the phone comes from Daniel Bischof with Baader Helvea. Please
go ahead, sir.

FINAL

Q - Daniel Bischof

{BIO 17407166 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you and good morning. Three questions from my side. And the ﬁrst here is
on the Swiss non-life business. Last year, Bâloise is still restructuring some of accident and
health businesses. I felt this process will come to an end in 2017. Could you explain what
happened with Swiss non-life business in the ﬁrst half? I think there were some changes
on the distribution side, but growth was still, let's say, bit on the lower end. So what's
going on there?
And secondly, sorry again, on the capital strength, maybe a bit from a diﬀerent
perspective, I'd be interested to know where you see enough capital deployment
opportunities organically or inorganically in the current environment or at which level you
would consider additional payouts to shareholders?

Bloomberg Transcript

And then, lastly, on the life side, just slide 19 here, if you could talk a bit about the moving
parts, some you have explained already. The decline on the savings result, is that simply
because of low realized gains or were there any other eﬀects and the risk result on the
other hand improved a bit more than your soft (00:20:58) guidance? And then also lastly,
the cost result was a bit weaker. Any comments here would be helpful.

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Let me pick the ﬁrst question, Daniel, and I think Carsten will actually pick up the question
two and three on the on capital strength and the sources of proﬁt in life. In the Swiss nonlife business, so we have actually also moderate growth in the separated market, which is I
think a very good news. Your question about accident and the health business, It's true
that it's still a market we look at and we watch because it's – we did some cleaning up of
the portfolio and re-underwriting of the portfolio in the past years. However, this market
has become a bit more technical and the fact that we have a slight growth in this business
is actually due to the fact that we increased premiums given the underwriting. So that's
actually what happened there.
On the distribution model, what we piloted over the last two years, we have actually rolled
out beginning of January of this year, which is what we call the omni-channel strategy,
which means that the customers are no longer owned by a channel, but the customer
chooses how to interact with us and all the channels work together, meaning, agents, be it
direct, be it the call center and so forth. So they all work actually together. And that's quite
big change in the Swiss market. And we are the frontrunners there in terms of really
deploying this omni-channel strategy. Overall, stable, proﬁtable, non-life Swiss market.

A - Carsten Stolz

{BIO 6055047 <GO>}

Yeah. Regarding your second question on capital deployment, I go back to the CHF 2
billion target that we are pursuing. We had CHF 415 million cash remittance in 2017. At the
Page 8 of 16



Company Name: Baloise Holding AG
Company Ticker: BALN SW Equity
Date: 2018-08-28

FINAL

moment, everything points to the direction that we will be able to conﬁrm this level of
cash remittance for 2018.
Given the dividend and the share buyback that we've executed so far in the ﬁrst half of
this year, with the dividends around CHF 260 million ﬂowing back to the shareholder and
around CHF 120 million from the share buyback, we have returned nearly CHF 400 million
to the shareholders in the ﬁrst half of this year. And obviously, the second layer is
investing into the strategy and into new bets.
So I think given the cash remittance that we have and given all angles with regard to
investment, dividends and buybacks, there is plenty of deployment opportunities with
regard to use of the CHF 2 billion cash remittance until 2021.
Then your question was on the proﬁt by sources analysis from the life segment, what has
happened there. You see a savings result that was lower in comparison to the ﬁrst half of
2017. One of the major reasons here was that we had to realize less capital gains, not the
least to put additional reserves especially in the German business according to the (24:35)
dynamics.

Bloomberg Transcript

The second part of the equation which is the reserving is not visible under an IFRS proﬁt
by sources analysis, so therefore you only see the one side of the coin. And this explains a
large part of the lower savings result in the ﬁrst half of this year.
On the risk results, we are sticking to our expectation that the risk result for the full year
will be around CHF 200 million to CHF 250 million. And on the cost side, we don't see
any substantial eﬀect or trend. So, if we pull all this together, it's been said before, the
CHF 200 million bottom guidance that we've given in the context of the Investor Day is
too cautious in current environment. So we think that a target area of CHF 300 million for
the life EBIT for 2018 is a better ballpark ﬁgure.

Q - Daniel Bischof

{BIO 17407166 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

The next question comes from Jonny Urwin with UBS. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning, all. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple, please. I just wanted
to dig into the German medical malpractice book a little bit. Apologies if I missed – if
these questions are repeating. I missed the very start of the call. So, ﬁrstly, can you give us
the size of the reserves now for that German med mal book? And could you also give us
the duration of the book? And I guess where do you believe your reserve on the best
estimate range now for that speciﬁc book? I wouldn't normally ask you to disclose this
level of detail on a speciﬁc book, but given the consistent deterioration we've seen, I think
it would be helpful.
Page 9 of 16



Company Name: Baloise Holding AG

FINAL

And then secondly, the carve-out of that book into run-oﬀ unit, is it just the help that the
German management focus on the new business in the front book rather than have to
manage legacy? Is it to do with presentation so we can see the progress of that book
more clearly? Or is there another reason that you're thinking about a divestment or a
reinsurance arrangement? Thank you.

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Well, if you look at the medical liability in Germany, what we've done is an intensive
review internally and externally of all reserves, not only the medical liability book. And we
are sure that we are reserved adequately. So that's for the whole book. What we've also
done in the ﬁrst half year if you've seen that is actually reserve strengthening for this
medical liability of about over CHF 45 million gross, so we originally reserved this book.
How long will it take? How long – there will be some volatility in this run-oﬀ book that is
clear at probably around 7 to 10 years. So it's long-term business, so it will still linger on to
some extent.
What we have done in separating this business and completely exiting this business and
in actually addressing it as a run-oﬀ unit on the group level is because we already have for
a long time a run-oﬀ group practice, which is specialized with the necessary expertise. So
actually it is, on one side, enabling the German management to focus on the strategy
execution away from industry into private customers and SME business and actually to
have the specialized experts here in headquarters actually managing and executing this
run-oﬀ in a good way. That's actually the decision we took.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

I guess, just to follow up on that – on the reserving adequacy, we've heard that comment
before that you're comfortable with the current reserving of the book and you think it's
adequate and then this further deterioration. I wonder if you can just give us some more
comfort via either anecdotal evidence or some hard numbers around the best estimate
range.

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Well, actually, so the amount we put in in terms of the additional reserve strengthening in
the medical liability is best estimate.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

That is best estimate.

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Yeah.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

So you're not reserving with a speciﬁc buﬀer over best estimate for that book?

FINAL

Okay. All right. And can you give us the overall size of the reserves now? Just for the med
mal book?

A - Gert De Winter

The next question from the phone comes from the line of Stefan Schürmann with
Vontobel. Sir, your line is now open. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Stefan Schürmann
Yes. Just two questions. One is to follow up on the reserve adjustments in life. You
mentioned that there was the reserve strengthening in Switzerland. If I take an old
estimate, I think it was around CHF 100 million. Maybe could you give some more insight
here of how much was relating to the individual on the group life?
And second question, just a very small one. I didn't ﬁnd the net new money on the asset
management side, maybe some elaboration on that side as well please?

A - Carsten Stolz

{BIO 6055047 <GO>}

Well, the net new asset is CHF 354 million. That compares with CHF 405 million for the
total of 2017. You can actually ﬁnd that number in the presentation on page – just a second
– page 26 on the left hand side. You can ﬁnd the net new asset number.

Q - Stefan Schürmann
Okay. And were the assets responsible for the inﬂows? Can you maybe...

A - Carsten Stolz

{BIO 6055047 <GO>}

That's the net new assets – that's the inﬂows.

Q - Stefan Schürmann
Yeah. But what kind of basically assets did produce that inﬂow? Is it ﬁxed income or?

quite successfully in the recent past.

Q - Stefan Schürmann

FINAL

Okay. Yeah. Thank you.

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

So, Stefan, with regard to reserves in Switzerland and the reserves strengthening in
Switzerland, we have done reserve strengthening for the entire book in Switzerland in
order to bring the interest requirement further down. That was one of the major reasons
why if you look at the interest rate margins that we disclosed on slide 20 contributing to
reducing on an overall level of 7 basis points, the book I think with regard to further detail,
I'll transfer you Marc and his team and they'll get back to you.

Q - Stefan Schürmann
Okay. Okay. That's helpful. Yeah. Thank you.

Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Frank Kopﬁnger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning, everybody. I have two questions. My ﬁrst question is a follow-up on
Jonny Urwin's question regarding the German run-oﬀ unit. For me, it was unclear whether
your preferred strategy now is an internal rundown and you keep it over also the sale of
the run-oﬀ unit could be or portfolio could be an option?
And then, secondly, on the life business, if interest rates were stable now from here on,
should we expect a further positive interest rate development or would you still further
strengthen reserves, for example, in Switzerland, which would lead to a negative eﬀect?

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

I think in the German run-oﬀ decision that we took, again, it was to enable the German
management to focus on executing the strategy away from industry into private
customers and SME.
And as we have this run-oﬀ unit already on the group level is to use their expertise to
actually have a solid run-oﬀ business. So that's the idea behind. I think towards the future,
I think diﬀerent options are possible including a potential sale of this book of business,
but it's too early to say now. I think we ﬁrst have to go into managing the run-oﬀ in an
appropriate way.

FINAL

In terms of life and the interest environment, if interest would remain stable or increase
slightly, it would clearly have a positive eﬀect for us, one on potential reserves release
which we have strengthened massively in the past; in terms of also recurring income, of
course, on new investment, in terms of P&L.
So, indeed, it's – I think we have seen in the ﬁrst half year that depending on the situation,
depending also on the local situation, you can have some reserve release or you can have
some reserve strengthening, which is required. Overall, a stable or a slightly increasing
interest environment would be very beneﬁcial for Bâloise.

Fantastic. Thank you so much. And I have three questions. The ﬁrst one is you pointed out
for 7 bps on page 20, and if I multiply that by your life reserves in Switzerland, which is
CHF 26 million, I get an answer of CHF 18 million, 1-8, of reserve strengthening, so I
wondered if that's roughly the calculation I should be doing?
The second is on the total cost of total investment in these investments projects, I just
wondered if you could give a total ﬁgure and maybe how it breaks down between an
investment in like a start-up and in an ongoing business, and how much is in the
combined ratio so far?
And then, on the medical malpractice, I'm not sure it's very fair, but I remember in Zurich
in 2012 or 2013 had a very signiﬁcant addition through medical malpractice or hospital
claims and they pulled out of that business. Now, just wondered, your portfolio, is this
eﬀectively the Zurich book, which you took over back then? It's just out of curiosity to see
the moving parts. Thank you.

A - Carsten Stolz

{BIO 6055047 <GO>}

I take the ﬁrst question on slide 20. The 7 basis points reduction that you see here is, ﬁrst
of all, for the entire life book. So it's not only Switzerland, it's the entire life book. And
obviously, it's also the year the run-oﬀ of the book policies come into maturity. So there's
a mixture of elements in it. The thing that I wanted to say is that part of the reserve
strengthening in Switzerland in order to get the interest rate requirement down is also
reﬂected on this. But that's page 20 is group perspective. And therefore, you cannot
directly calculate back from the Swiss reserves to these 7 basis points.

Lovely. Thank you.

Maybe on the investments in digital initiatives, I think what is important to say is that we
actually consider those initiatives on a case-by-case basis. That means if an idea, if an
initiative, if an investment makes sense, then we do that. So we don't have an overall
budget where we say, well, we're going to invest that much in digital initiatives. It's on a
case-by-case basis that the business case has to make sense. I think also digital is certainly
not only about technology, I think it's really a change of mind, a change of behavior in the
customer, and it's a change of mind in our culture to actually deal with digital.

Bloomberg Transcript

Digital is by far not a technology thing only. If you would name a number, I think if you
look back at our digital initiative and it also depends on how you deﬁne digital, of course.
Investing in our core business and our core IT systems to make them more agile and to be
– to make them more easy for the customers are also digital investments. I would say run
rate of investment is CHF 150 million more or less per year, but again evaluated on a caseby-case basis.
And the third question, the medical malpractice. If you look at the portfolio we have, it's a
pretty – one, it's a pretty small portfolio that we still have. We started writing medical
liability in the mid-2000s, so 2005, 2006. There was indeed a big shock in 2012 with
Zurich. We did not take over that portfolio at all. Our portfolio is much, much smaller. And
actually over the last years, we stopped writing new business.
And in 2016, 2017, and 2018, we exited from everything. So that's actually what happened
over the last year. So, since the early 2010s, we actually re-underwrite a lot and we exited
the whole medical liability. But we still have to deal now with the run-oﬀ of that portfolio.

Lovely. Brilliant. Thank you so much. Thank you.

The next question comes from René Locher with MainFirst. Please go ahead.

Q - René Locher
Yes. Good morning, all. Just a quick one on Germany, I remember that you were guiding
for a German combined ratio of 96%, 98% in the medium term now in H1, 96.4%. So my

question is how sustainable is this?
And perhaps you can also comment on your business mix in Germany. As far as I know,
one-third was commercial business, two-third was retail business. You have shown a little
bit of growth in the German book. That would be my ﬁrst question. Just the second one,
we have discussed this already, but realized capital gains are more than CHF 100 million
lower year-over-year. And, yeah, I was wondering, of course, it's hard to quantify, but
perhaps you can give just kind of a – for guidance what we should expect for H2. Thank
you.

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Thank you, René. I think if you look at Germany, the combined ratio target we set was 96%
to 98%, and indeed, we achieved that in the ﬁrst half year. If you look at the business, it's
solid. So if we don't have big catastrophes or events in the second half year, we are very
conﬁdent that we'll remain at this level, 96%, 98%.

Bloomberg Transcript

The underlying quality of the portfolio is good, so the private business that we are writing
more and more has a claims ratio just below 60%. So that's solid, that's quality, and that's
sustainable. And if you look at the execution of the strategy, so away from high-risk
industry business in which we only took portions of bigger contracts into private
customers and SME business, I think we are seeing clearly growth in the business in
private customers so we increased it by 5% in the ﬁrst half year.
So we are generating a lot of new customers in private business based on two elements,
working together in a very simple solution with brokers, which generates standard
commoditized, high-volume business. That's one. And secondly, our medallion strategy,
which is if we actually release a new product bid in non-life or the life, we always want to
be in the top three of the comparable site. And this brings, of course, a lot of new
customers. So we're clearly decreasing our exposure to industry, and we're clearly
increasing our success and business mix in private customers and SME. So the strategy is
working.

Q - René Locher
Okay. Thanks.

A - Carsten Stolz

{BIO 6055047 <GO>}

On the realized capital gains, I can add that there has been a decrease compared to ﬁrst
half year of 2017 although basically in 2017, the number has been rather high since we had
to undertake a very strong resource strengthening on the life side that was partly
triggered by legal requirements, especially in Germany with the (42:26). And so capital
gains have always to be seen in the context of these reserve strengthenings especially in
the life business. So given outlook, that really depends on the interest rate environment.
In P&C, it also, of course, depends on the market environment. So it's diﬃcult to give a
clear outlook for the rest of the year.

If there are no further questions, then I would actually close it here. Many thanks for your
attendance and the questions. I think with the half-year results, we have again proven to
build further on our strengths. And with Simply Safe strategy, we're actually building the
future of Bâloise. Thank you very much.
