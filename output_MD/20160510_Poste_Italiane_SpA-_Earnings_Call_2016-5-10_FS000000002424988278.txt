Good evening and welcome to the Poste Italiane 2016 First Quarter Results Conference
Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the
conference over to Mr. Luigi Ferraris, Chief Financial Oﬃcer. Please go ahead, sir.

Luigi Ferraris

{BIO 7424315 <GO>}

So, good evening, ladies and gentlemen. We are pleased to report a solid set of numbers
for the ﬁrst quarter 2016. As anticipated in our full-year call, the evolution of our quarterly
earnings is a function of the timing of our portfolio management. Q1 has beneﬁted from
such a timing. The underlying trends are, however, aligned with our expectations and
conﬁrm for each of our business progress of execution as per our plans.
Revenues for the period are close to €10 billion, growing at 14%. EBIT has grown 16% to
€562 million. Net proﬁt has grown 18% to €367 million. This solid set of ﬁgures generated
robust funds from operation in the region of €250 million that I will further explain in the
following charts.
Moving into the next slide, here, you have an overview of our key numbers. Consolidated
revenues and proﬁts increased respectively by about 14% and 16% over the period. This is
mainly due to the following: Financial Services operating proﬁt increased by 7% from
€250 million to €267 million. This increase is mainly attributable to higher capital gains
realized from active management of BancoPosta asset portfolio of about €72 million and

lower operating cost by 26%. All of this has been partially compensated by higher net
recharges from the Mail & Parcel business units of about €76 million.
Insurance Services revenues increased by approximately 20% from €6 billion to €7.2
billion, and operating proﬁt maintained a robust 11% growth year-on-year mainly due to
the ongoing positive performance of the segment. Mail & Parcel revenues were equal to
€936 million, down 5% from 2015. This expected decline mainly relates to a reduction of
traditional postal volume. And as for EBIT, please bear in mind that we will account for our
usual accruals only in the ﬁnal course of the year. As you know, this business once
reached full-year operating breakeven for some time, but I will better detail this trend in
the later chart.
Before moving into each speciﬁc business units, let's have a look at our client's asset
breakdown on slide number four. Total volumes increased by more than 2%, bringing
total asset to €486 billion versus €476 billion in 2015. The mix remains substantially stable
and well balanced with a clear resilience of postal savings collection and a material
increase for about €3 billion in our current account deposits.

Bloomberg Transcript

In the contest of recent turbulence in the Italian banking industry, the strength and
reliability of our brands, coupled with simple, safe (03:46) products, continue to deliver
an increasing asset base and proﬁtability for the growth.
Let's now move into each speciﬁc business unit results. Starting with our Financial Service
revenues evolution on slide number ﬁve. Revenues have grown mainly as a consequence
of realized capital gains, amounted to €386 million. Let me remind you that during the
course of 2016, we expect to generate through the active management of our portfolio,
total revenues in the region of €2 billion, as a combination of capital gains and yield.
Within this framework, please note that in the ﬁrst quarter, we already realized
approximately 80% of the total capital gains expected for the full year.
In more detail, slide number six provides you with a breakdown of the Financial Services
business units revenues. The major key points here are the following. First, returns on
current account deposits. Higher revenues are mainly due to the already commented
higher capital gains. Second, fees from postal savings collection and administration.
Although net collection was higher than in ﬁrst quarter 2015, fees were lower, as this year
they do not include revenues for ancillary services developments. Third, fees from
transaction banking. Revenue decrease is mainly driven by the public broadcasters
decision to adapt a new payment system for license fees, resulting approximately 9
million payment slips less than 2015.
Distribution fees, as indicated in the slide, we recorded growing revenues in personal
loans and other personal ﬁnancing products. This is an area of development for
BancoPosta that has recently renewed its oﬀer range in this sector and launched a
marketing campaign.
Fifth, payment card fees, the reduction is mainly due to a lower subscription fee applying
to debt and prepaid cards. Here, the performance has to be assessed taken into account

FINAL

the positive contribution of about €1 billion debt/prepaid cards have on BancoPosta
deposits.
Let's now move to slide number seven. On active portfolio management, let me point out
the following major items. An increase in average deposits of BancoPosta accounts
moving to €48 billion from €45 billion in 2015, 7% up. The unrealized capital gains amount
to €5 billion vis-à-vis €6 billion of the previous years. Let me also remind you that as of the
end of 2015, our realized capital gains amounted to €5.4 billion.
Let's now move to BancoPosta regulatory framework and capital position on slide number
eight. In as much as BancoPosta capital adequacy is concerned, let me stress four major
key points. First BancoPosta regulatory framework continues to be fully aligned to
European standards. Second, ﬁrst quarter 2016 Tier 1 ratio reached 15.2%, substantially
doubling the minimum regulatory requirements.
Third, ﬁrst quarter 2016 leverage ratio stands at 3%, as a consequence of higher assets
under management. Should the growth of BancoPosta asset under management
continue, we are in any case prepared to recapitalize BancoPosta with no impact on our
dividend policy. Fourth, ﬁrst quarter proﬁtability recorded a 36% return on equity versus
30% for the full-year 2015.

Bloomberg Transcript

All of this, coupled with a zero lending risk proﬁle, makes BancoPosta a unique superior
return fees based revenues players in the Italian ﬁnancial industry.
Let's now move to Insurance Services on slide number nine. Gross written premium
increased by 24%, driven primarily by the continued increase of our life gross written
premium collection, conﬁrming Poste Vita as a number one life insurance in the Italian
markets. However, we have also beneﬁted from double-digit growth albeit from a small
base in our non-life oﬀering, where we are executing a development strategy, whose
results will become more and more material moving towards the ﬁnal parts of the plan
period.
In as much as our investment portfolio breakdown is concerned, let me highlight the
increase of investments in equity multi-asset products which moved from 6% in 2015 to
11% in 2016, conﬁrming our diversiﬁcation strategy towards a more adequate risk to return
proﬁle. This continues to be fully in line with our capital requirement.
Let's now move to slide number 10. On the Mail & Parcel business units, volumes, let me
highlight here that on the one hand, traditional mail volumes fell close to 10% year-onyear, slightly slowing down the negative trend versus the 10.2% decline recorded last year.
On the other hand, Parcel volumes increased by 10% year-on-year, conﬁrming the positive
momentum mainly driven by the growing e-commerce penetration in Italy. More
speciﬁcally, the 6% decrease in Mail revenues, vis-à-vis a 10% reduction in volumes,
demonstrates the positive impact of the new regulation which has led to a shift in volumes
from J plus 1 to J plus 4 (10:21) products. Thus, beneﬁting from the positive regulated
price increase.

FINAL

Moving to slide number 11. Well, ﬁrst, let me remind you that intrasegment revenues
increased by approximately 6%, mainly due to the higher revenues, driven by capital
gains recorded by the Financial Service business unit as well as higher gross written
premium collection. At the same time, operating costs have decreased by 1.2% periodover-period, as a result of continued cost management action.
Speciﬁcally, Mail & Parcel operating costs have been further reduced by €25 million over
the period, mainly as a result of lower cost of goods sold which decreased almost 2%
primarily due to lower IT operation expenses and lower cost on vehicles and logistics. I
will comment on overall labor cost dynamics in the following charts.
Let me now move to slide number 12 to discuss group operating costs. Focusing on our
cost structure at a consolidating level, overall group operating cost structure remains
substantially stable. The already mentioned reduction in costs of goods sold has been
partially compensated by higher D&A related to previous year's CapEx. Let me conﬁrm
here that we expect the full impact of our new managerial (11:58) action in terms of costs
reduction to be fully implemented starting from the year-end onwards.

Bloomberg Transcript

And now moving to slide number 13, labor costs remained substantially stable year-onyear at €1.5 billion, but you know that we have launched a voluntary pre-retirement plan,
and we expect 5,000 people to leave the group through this plan. As of the end of
March, about 2,300 people have already signed up to the pre-retirement scheme, and
they will leave the group by the end of the year. We will, therefore, see the full impact on
payroll in 2017 in line with our plan.
As for 2016, we will pursue further reduction in head count versus 2015. However, please
bear in mind that during the course of the year, we will ﬁnalize the renegotiation of the
National Labor Contract.
Let's now run through how our proﬁt and loss evolution is below the EBIT line on slide
number 14. Net income for the period equaled €367 million, recording an increase of
approximately 18% from €311 million recorded last year, in the ﬁrst quarter of last year.
On top of the already commented positive EBIT evolution from 2015 to 2016, this
performance is related to net ﬁnancial income equal to €6 million, taxes for a total
consideration of €200 million corresponding to a tax rate of about 35%, a further
reduction versus last year. For the full-year 2016, we expect a normalized tax rate in line
with full year 2015, i.e., 39%.
Let's move on to slide number 15 commenting on CapEx. The optimization of the overall
investment program for the period is part of the restructuring program. More speciﬁcally,
the majority of the investment program is mainly related to information technology and
digital platforms. The balance is related to a selective upgrade of facilities, construction of
data center buildings and postal logistics operation.
Finally, let's focus on the industrial net ﬁnancial position on slide number 16. First, let me
highlight the positive contribution of our funds from operation as a result of the already

FINAL

commented operating performance. On the other side, negative change in working
capital is mainly due to the capital gain dynamics recorded during the quarter, and
speciﬁcally during the month of March, which will be paid by BancoPosta to the parent
company during the course of the year.
Furthermore, let me also remind you the usual seasonality of our working capital variation
which usually worsens in the ﬁrst quarter of each year. On cash (15:07) receivable, we
expect to complete the cash in by year end with a consequent relevant impact on the
change in working capital. Thank you for your attention and let me hand over to the CEO,
Francesco Caio for some closing remarks. Francesco?

Francesco Caio

{BIO 1516226 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Luigi, and good evening to all of you on the call, and we've seen a
good quarter of further progress in the execution of our plan and we look at it as a sound
base for moving forward with quarters of execution again in the rest of the year.

Bloomberg Transcript

In Financial Services as Luigi has indicated, we booked about 80% of the capital gains that
we have planned for the year, and we've seen a growth of about €3 billion in current
account deposits. Now the focus is on continued growth in other services, primarily the
personal loans, the cross-selling and hopefully consolidating the good results of net
inﬂows of current account deposits.
In Insurance Services and Asset Management, we have continued to grow the premium
trend with a growth rate year-on-year of more than 20%, but the same time as Luigi
mentioned a moment or so ago, we begin to see some momentum in non-Life and Asset
Management products. As you know, this is an important element of our mid-term plan
and we would expect to see some interesting numbers by the end of this year. There is a
lot of eﬀort going on in terms of training our sales force, making sure our branches are
ready to respond to the challenge, and as I said, the non-Life and Asset Management
begins to show up in our books.
In Mail & Parcels clearly the challenge ahead is the scaling up of our new delivery process
of alternate days. That is instrumental to make sure that the cost optimization target that
we have will be delivered starting in 2017, and we remind you again that the restructuring
charges for the year ahead will be booked as in previous years in Q4. Therefore, in
assessing the overall performance of this sector, you have to keep in mind that Q4 will
bear the cost of the restructuring charges. All of that putting it together give us a good
ﬁnancial position, good robust cash generation and that kind of solidity that we need to
support our CapEx plan, pay for the dividends that as you know are still planned to be
80% of net earnings for this year and over time, give us some ﬂexibility in at least
considering some potential strategic options, obviously to the extent that they make
sense from a shareholder's standpoint in creating additional value.
So that was what we were keen to share with you, a good progress versus plan and
continued focus on execution, and now I guess there is some time for a Q&A session and
therefore I will hand it over to the moderator for the questions. Thank you very much.

Thank you. I will now hand the conference over to Luca Torchia, Head of Investor
Relations, to host the Q&A session.

{BIO 19160880 <GO>}

Thank you. The ﬁrst question is coming from Gianluca Ferrari, Mediobanca. Please,
Gianluca, go ahead.

Q - Gianluca Ferrari

{BIO 15042989 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, good evening. I have a few questions. The ﬁrst one is on the €936 million revenues
from Mail & Parcels. I was wondering if you can give us the data for Mail, I think in your
ﬁnancial report, you will highlight that so it would be useful to have it now.
Second question is on the early retirement. You updated on the exits in Q1 and what you
expect for the full year. Can you also update us on the hiring you made in Q1 and what do
you expect for the full year?
My third question is on P&C, you mentioned the double-digit growth in premiums, and
we know also the combined ratio of this business you garnered in Q1. The fourth and ﬁnal
question is on a focus on Life Insurance, did I understand correctly that you are launching
now a unit-linked policy. If this is correct, can you elaborate a bit on what kind of product
it is, what are the underlying assets and the margins linked to this product? Thank you.

A - Luigi Ferraris

{BIO 7424315 <GO>}

So, let me try to address the ﬁrst question, revenues made in Parcel, as of the end of ﬁrst
quarter, the revenues related to the Mail are in the region of €720 million, €730 million.
The remaining portion is Parcel plus some other revenues. When it comes to the hiring, in
the ﬁrst quarter, we have hired about 500 people and basically we expect that these
should be the entire program for 2016. So, we do not expect additional hiring during the
course of the year...

A - Francesco Caio

{BIO 1516226 <GO>}

It's not marginal...

FINAL

...It's not marginal, but this is the vast majority of costs. Then, we have when it comes to
the Life Insurance, when it comes to the premiums, and let's say the progress, say, in
gross written premium, we had double-digit growth and this is deﬁnitely correct, and, I
mean we are still conﬁdent and positive on the evolution of debt.

A - Francesco Caio

{BIO 1516226 <GO>}

Combined ratio is 77%.

A - Luigi Ferraris

{BIO 7424315 <GO>}

The combined ratio is about 77%. I mean, new unit-linked, it is true, we have launched
these new products. When it comes in terms of risk, I would say we are talking about a
moderate risk (21:53) approach, in line with our strategy and with our, let's say poise. The
unit margin (22:00) is in the region of, say, 1%, and the recurring fee is in the region of
more or less the same amount, so 1.1%.

Q - Gianluca Ferrari

{BIO 15042989 <GO>}

Are the underlying funds entirely coming from Anima or also other third-party parcel
managers (22:20)?

A - Luigi Ferraris

{BIO 7424315 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I would say Anima for the vast majority, yes.

Q - Gianluca Ferrari

{BIO 15042989 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Luca Torchia

{BIO 19160880 <GO>}

The next question is coming from Kunal Zaveri, JPMorgan.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Yeah. Hi. This is Ashik Musaddi from Kunal's line. Just a couple of questions, ﬁrst of all if I
look at your investment portfolio and in the Insurance business, it looks like you have 11%
of assets into equity funds. Now if I look at the ﬁrst quarter, there was a point in February
when equity markets in Italy was down 25%, so is it fair to say that at that point you had
wiped out around, say, 40% of your capital in the Insurance business. Is it a fair way to
think about it, because you look pretty highly levered in terms of how much equity you
have in the guaranteed business versus how much capital you have in Insurance under
Solvency II, for the ﬁrst one? Second one is, if I look at the banking revenues, can you just
give a bit more color about what's going on with postal savings, transaction banking,
payment card fees, because Q-on-Q – sorry, year-on-year all these items declined, is there
any sort of seasonality or this is what we should expect going forward as well? Thank you.

A - Luigi Ferraris

{BIO 7424315 <GO>}
Page 7 of 16



Company Name: Poste Italiane SpA
Company Ticker: PST IM Equity
Date: 2016-05-10

Well, let me address the ﬁrst question ﬁrst. I mean, we have named this 11% equity, the
real equity content is in the region of 10% to this 11%. So, we are talking about 1% or 2% as
really relating of the total technical reserve to the equity.

FINAL

In reality, we are talking about multi-assets. So the risk exposure is minimum and of
course, we have not been impacted by the ﬂuctuation in the performance of the equity
market that occurred during the course of the ﬁrst quarter.
In terms of – as a consequence but not only for that, in terms of capital requirement
absorption, Poste Vita is in a good shape. We are still there, we have reported at the end
of last year a Solvency II ratio of 405% and we, at the end of the ﬁrst quarter I would say
that we're basically there. So we are 404%. So, still...

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Can you give a bit more clarity on what this equity fund hang (24:45) – because I thought
it is equity, equity fund means equity, but can you give us a bit more color what – if on an
underlying basis, what these assets are?

A - Luigi Ferraris

{BIO 7424315 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

We are talking about – let's say, the multi-asset class is mainly corporate bonds plus as I
said there is an equity portion of 10% of the total. The exposure (25:17) I would say, wellbalanced in terms of also on ﬁnal investments, we are talking about high yield with low
risk proﬁle, we have corporate bonds and we have also – so we're, I would say, wellbalanced.
As of today – as of the end of March, if I'm not wrong, we can say that there are no major
risks for our customers as a consequence of this allocation.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Yeah. Okay. Thanks a lot. That's clear. And just on the banking part?

A - Luigi Ferraris

{BIO 7424315 <GO>}

Yeah, exactly. You had also another question related to the evolution of our banking
revenues. I mean, when it comes to current accounts we have been very clear since the
beginning. We see underlying yield declining, so net-net of the capital gain, the
remuneration is in the region of 3.2%, which is showing a decline versus last year, which
was 3.6%, 3.5% to be precise, but that's in line with our expectation, so we do not have a
surprise and that's – we said that thanks to the portfolio that we have and thanks to the
unrealized proﬁt that we have in our hands, we can guarantee €2 billion revenues this year
and I will also say that if the general environment doesn't change, so we still, we are going
to stay in a zero-rating interest scenario, it will continue to be like that also in the coming
two years or three years.

Yes. Okay.

FINAL

A - Luigi Ferraris

{BIO 7424315 <GO>}

So, the trend is stability here. Transaction banking, we are going to this year to see the
impact of – as I said, of the broadcast in change payment which has been changing (27:11),
that will be absorbed during the course of 2017, I would say, in 2016 that diﬀerence will
remain as it is. When it comes to the payment card fees, we have seen a decline despite a
signiﬁcant increase in volumes because of a change in the interchange fees decided by
the European Community, and again we put in place a plan, thanks to which we do
expect to recover, I would say during the course of the year, to go back to the same level
of 2015 revenues.
Postal savings, I mean, the volumes are showing improvement versus last year, and we
have a slight decline in the remuneration because we have a premium component that
was part of the calculation last year which has not been repeated this year as a
consequence of the decline that we have seen in postal savings particularly at the end of
2015.

...from Michael van Wegen, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please, Michael, go ahead.

Q - Michael van Wegen

{BIO 6435238 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you. All right. Good evening everybody. Couple of things, starting with the
Mail business or the Mail & Parcel business. If you look at slide 10, the breakdown that you
gave of the Mail volumes, the unrecorded mail is pretty much ﬂat, but your direct
marketing and unaddressed mail plus the other bucket are the ones that are materially
under pressure, can you talk a little bit about what – yeah, how you're able to keep the
unrecorded mail stable, and what the outlook is for the two buckets that are particularly
under pressure, should we continue to expect similar volume declines going forward or
how and when do you expect that to tail oﬀ. The other thing is, if I look at volume versus
revenue development then it looks like the price increases that you've been able to put
through in Q1 are considerably lower than the price increase – increases that were
announced in October, can you talk a little bit about how repricing is coming through the
numbers and how much is still to be expected or whether we're seeing a full impact
there? Then a ﬁnal question on the Mail business. If you look at page – let me see, sorry,

Page 9 of 16



Company Name: Poste Italiane SpA
Company Ticker: PST IM Equity
Date: 2016-05-10

FINAL

for the – yeah, that's on page 28, if you look at the other operating expenses for your Mail
& Parcel business, that's down 6% year-over-year, is that representative of the
developments that you're making or should we not extrapolate that? And I think you
talked about less IT investments and some lower cost of vehicles, is that the explanation,
that is (30:18), is that sustainable?
Then two questions on the Insurance business. Premium levels are incredibly strong in Q1.
How comfortable are you in maintaining this kind of level of production? You're essentially
oﬀering a quite attractive crediting rate for new business, but that could harm you – you
could suﬀer from your own success in the sense that the more new business you write, the
more pressure that comes on the overall investment return and the crediting rate, so what
kind of volume of new business are you prepared to take in? And then ﬁnally, sorry, on the
Insurance operating expenses. If you strip out the technical provision to changes in your
expenses, there's a very material increase in the Insurance operating expenses. I think it
doubles up roughly year-over-year. What's driving that, please? Thank you.

A - Luigi Ferraris

{BIO 7424315 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So, I will try to address the question that you raised, so let me start from the ﬁrst one, how
is Mail business volumes. I mean, when it comes to the – our recorded mail, we have to
assume that this will continue to suﬀer of the late (31:38) substitution. So, we do not
expect a change in the trends. All in all, when we talk about that volumes of the Mail, we
still see for the current year, I mean, a double-digit decline. So a 10% decline is something
that unfortunately it looks likely to continue during the course of this year.
Of course, when it comes to the price, and therefore to the revenues, the trend is
diﬀerent, because the change in the regulation and in particular in the pricing has allowed
us to basically reduce the volume decline down to slightly less than 5%, four point
something. I mean, if I'm not wrong, during the course of the IPO, Francesco and I've said
that basically we expected a decline in the revenues as a consequence of the
implementation of the regulatory change in the region of 4% to 5%. So, I think we are still
there. So I do not see any major changes for now. And as we said also during the full-year
results presentation, the elasticity for the ﬁrst quarter, it seems to be close to zero.
When it comes to the other expenses on chart 28, I mean the vast majority of the savings
that I mentioned at the group level are deﬁnitely concentrated in the Mail & Parcel,
because here we have all the Mail business, and also the postal oﬃce businesses, so the
concentration is there.
Is 6% something that we can assume during the course of the year? I mean, I think that the
trend will continue. I cannot guarantee that will be 6%, but for sure we do expect a
decline – one-digit decline probably will be a little bit lower than this one, than the 6%
that you see over here. But of course, we are working hard on that in order to – trying to
match these results. When it comes to the Insurance business and therefore to the
sustainability of the growth of our business – Life business, Life Insurance business. Well, I
mean, we are – I think we are still in a position to support this growth, because ﬁrst of all,
as you might recall, we have resolved on the 1st of July of last year to adopt – to guarantee

Page 10 of 16



Company Name: Poste Italiane SpA
Company Ticker: PST IM Equity
Date: 2016-05-10

FINAL

zero return to our customers. We are in a position to maintain a minimum guarantee rate
in the region of 1%, which is something that, what we have seen.
And if I look at our technical reserves and to our embedded proﬁts or gain if you want
that we have in particular on the 73% portion of our total assets invested in the Govies,
well, I think we are in a position to support for sure another year like this one but probably
also the following. And so, we are still in a position to support growth for this year for sure
and very likely for next year as well.
The last question was I think, Insurance expense, sorry. The issue related to the growth of
the operational expenses in the Insurance business. Well, ﬁrst, let me remind you that
we're a little bit complicated in terms of legal structure in terms of reporting, but that's the
way we are. What I want to say is that when we have an increase in our revenues and
therefore in our premiums in the Insurance business, the vast majority of the fees that we
receive at the very beginning or in the moment that we open a new position, a new
customer goes back to the Financial Services, to BancoPosta. Therefore, the portion that
remains in the end of Poste Vita is low. This is going to be a cost for Poste Vita.

Bloomberg Transcript

When it comes to the Insurance business per se, in terms of operating costs, it's very, very
limited and it is deﬁnitely a function of the additional activities that we are doing, but they
are very, very cheap because the cost – the real cost (36:11) proceeds in our postal oﬃce
business, which is we charge it, as you know, to that mechanism – intersegment
mechanism, to the Financial business and also to the Insurance business. I think I basically
covered all the questions.

Q - Operator
Yes. Good evening. I have two questions. The ﬁrst one is on the Insurance business and,
what, I was wondering if you could give us the amount of the capital gains and the total
revenues of the segment for the ﬁrst quarter?
And the second question is on the mutual funds. As I can argue, your mutual funds should
amount to approximately €6 billion at the end of March. So, I was wondering if you can
elaborate a little bit on your partnership with Anima. How it is going on and what could
you – could you expect for the remaining part of the year? Thank you.

A - Luigi Ferraris

{BIO 7424315 <GO>}

Okay. So, let me start from the ﬁrst question, I mean, we do not have capital gain in the
results related to the Insurance business. What I said is, if we look at the technical reserves
and the way they are invested, and particularly in Govies, we have in this part of assets

embedded capital gain, I think for something close to €10 billion, even more that are
belonging to our customer, not to us, but which are there to support the remuneration of
our customer in the future. That's why we feel conﬁdent that we are in a position to
support additional growth in the Life business.
When it comes to the mutual funds, while the €6 billion are the total assets on the
manifest of our operating company S.G.A. (38:29), but the portion belonging to Anima is
by far lower, of course the partnership has started a few months ago. We are deﬁnitely
quite happy about the way it's going on, both in terms of operational partnership, in
particular they are strongly supporting us in training our sales force. And when it comes to
the size, in the ﬁrst three months of the year, they have – we have basically placed about, if
I'm not wrong, €400 million – €300 million of Anima products, let me put it this way.
So, we are doing – net, of course, we're talking about net ﬂow, €330 million of net ﬂow at
the end of March 2016. It is continuing so, April is showing very robust performance, so
it's going up and we are happy with that. I mean we are happy both in terms of size,
reach, and in terms also of support that they are giving us in particular in training our
services (39:35).

Q - Michael Werner

{BIO 4790902 <GO>}

Hello, hi. And good evening. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two questions,
one actually to follow up on the previous speaker, just looking at the training involved
between Anima and the Poste sales force, how far along is that process? Is that something
that will continue to develop as we go through this year, therefore in theory, can we
expect I guess a bit of ramp-up in terms of those net ﬂows? And that's my ﬁrst question.
And then, on the – my second question is related to expenses in the mail business, and if
you look on slide 11, if you take a look at the intersegment costs and other costs, that
accounted for a very strong portion of the decline in the year-on-year operating costs
within the Mail & Parcels business. So, I was just wondering what speciﬁcally was
accounting for that decline from the €48 million last year to €24 million in the ﬁrst quarter
of this year? Thank you.

A - Francesco Caio

{BIO 1516226 <GO>}

Let me ask you – let me answer the question on the training and on the relationship with
Anima. This is deﬁnitely an ongoing mid- to long-term process. We are determined to
equip ourselves with a nationwide capability in our branches to address customers'
requirements for products that could potentially have some yield in the zero-interest
world, and because as you know, we come from a world of certainty and protection of
capital and yield, there is a massive eﬀort to make sure that we are transparent and very
clear in the explanation of the risk return proﬁle that our customers might be willing to
undertake when buying this products that are relatively new for them.

Back to the second part of your ﬁrst question which is, are we expecting growth? Yes, we
are expecting growth. We're not going to be expecting numbers that are going to be
moving the needle materially in terms of the asset base when it comes to the end of this
year. But as Luigi was saying, we're seeing month to month some progress from a
relatively lowest base (41:56) and I would emphasize that, but it's a double-digit growth
and that's why we're investing in training and other systems to make sure that in the
horizon 2018 to 2019, we'd begin to see some material impact on our asset base.

A - Luigi Ferraris

{BIO 7424315 <GO>}

Well, when it comes to the second question, I mean, if we look at the composite – the
diﬀerent components of this €2 billion plus cost, we also have something related to
accrual or mainly related to litigation. And if we compare the ﬁrst quarter of this year
versus last year, we have a decline in this net accrual of the diﬀerence that you see over a
year, so we are talking about something close to €25 million, something like that.

Q - Anna Adamo

{BIO 16893946 <GO>}

Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. And thanks for taking my questions. Just I was wondering
if you can give us an update on the Solvency II position of Poste Vita. And the second
question is regarding to BancoPosta, I mean, the leverage ratio in BancoPosta is
approaching the regulatory minimum of 3%. And if I understood it correctly, during the
call, you mentioned that you will be recapitalized BancoPosta in the future, can you just
tell us other source of funding with regards to this potential recapitalization of
BancoPosta? Thank you very much.

A - Luigi Ferraris

{BIO 7424315 <GO>}

Well, let me start with the ﬁrst question regarding Solvency II ratio, I mean if we go
through an update of what we have reported at the end of last year with the same – with
the same formula and with the same criteria, we are substantially stable. So, we stood at
the end of last year at 405%, we are at 404%, so no major changes here, no particular
capital absorption. When it comes to the leverage ratio of BancoPosta, I mean as I said,
should this growth of this BancoPosta assets under management continue during the
course of the year, because we need also to check if this is going to be stable, at the end
of this year, we are prepared to allocate portion of the net proﬁt of BancoPosta for the
beneﬁt of the recapitalization of the increase of this portion of capital.
I also said that this is not going to aﬀect our dividend policy or our dividends in terms of
size because this is only an eﬀect on the legal entity in which BancoPosta is – which is
Poste Italiane SpA, which is one that has to pay the dividends. So, it's going to impact the
– let's say, the statutory account in terms of income available to support, not the

consolidated dividend, but the payment of dividend as a local holding company. We are
not concerned about them because we are in a position to further increase the dividend
ﬂow from the subsidiaries to the holding company, and I mean just to give you a number,
here, we are talking about something in the region of €80 million, €90 million maximum,
should the increase in the asset under management remain as it is today.

Q - Anna Adamo

{BIO 16893946 <GO>}

Okay. That's very clear. Thank you.

A - Luigi Ferraris

{BIO 7424315 <GO>}

You're welcome.

A - Luca Torchia

{BIO 19160880 <GO>}

Great. I understand we have a follow-up from Gianluca Ferrari, Mediobanca.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Gianluca Ferrari

{BIO 15042989 <GO>}

Yes. Sorry for the follow-up. I was wondering if you can give us an update on how much
receivables do you expect to cash in, and if it is correct to assume a net ﬁnancial position –
an industrial net ﬁnancial position in between €800 million to €1 billion at year-end? And
linked to this, also in the light of the potential recapitalization of BancoPosta you just
mentioned, is it possible for you to go in the ﬁxed income market to increase a bit your
debt position given the attractive interest rates, also as a possibility to fund the potential
M&A deals or you expect to use only the net cash you have in the balance sheet debt?
Thank you.

A - Luigi Ferraris

{BIO 7424315 <GO>}

Let me try to address your very articulated question. Well, when it comes to the past due
receivables, at the end of last year, I said that we still have about €800 million of past due
receivable to be cashed in during the course of the year. We have already cashed in, in
the ﬁrst quarter, something in the leisure of €130 million, and we expect to ﬁnalize the
remaining portion of receivable during the course of this year, maximum beginning next
year.
I would be prudent in saying that this means an increase of our net cash position of the
same amount because we need to consider that we are going out also to pay some
personnel costs, and also there will be some working capital arising during the course of
the year. So, I would encourage you to be a little bit more prudent when it comes to the
side that you are talking about.
The capitalization of BancoPosta is not aﬀecting the cash position, it's aﬀecting the
dividend capability of old income, but as I said, during the course of the IPO process, we
also have about €1 billion of available reserves distributed for reserves to pay dividend,
but I don't think we're going to use that because we are in a position to further increase
the dividend ﬂow from our subsidiaries, particularly also the insurance business even the
high level of capitalization that we had simply by taking advantage of the net proﬁt that

they are doing. (48:25) the markets to raise some funds in terms of bonds, I mean there is
no need today, we saw there are no plan in the short term, of course, I mean, we are
raising for Poste is a well-known player on the ﬁnancial market. Should we need that, we
can do without any major problem, but we are not planning to do that on a short-term
basis.

Q - Maura Garbero

{BIO 2163705 <GO>}

Good evening, thanks for taking my questions. The ﬁrst one is on the Financial Services,
I'd have to come back on the trading gain. You said that in Q1 2016, you had a trading
gain of €386 million, can you tell us what was the trading gain in Q1 of last year?

Bloomberg Transcript

Second question is related to the Mail division and this time is on the restructuring costs.
You said that this year, the restructuring costs will be all booked to the ﬁnal quarter of the
year. I was wondering if that was the case also in 2015, or we have changed the timing
and strategy for those charges?
And the ﬁnal question still on the Mail division is related to your pricing. Is the new pricing
has been fully implemented or the beneﬁt should still increase during the course of the
year? Thank you very much.

A - Luigi Ferraris

{BIO 7424315 <GO>}

All right. So, let me start with the ﬁrst question. This year, we have reported, as you
correctly said, €386 million of capital gain. Last year, we have reported €309 million, so
€77 million plus versus last year. When it comes to the restructuring costs, in 2015, we
have booked basically the entire accrual related to our eﬃciency program, and therefore,
restructuring costs in the fourth quarter of 2015, as we said, both Francesco and I, this is
going to happen again this year, so in the last quarter of 2016. And we do expect
something in the region of €300 million and €350 million.
And third, the implementation of the new price in the mail business is done, so we are
fully applying the new price structure. As I said, we have not seen any major impact in
terms of elasticity. So we're basically seeing FX in line with our expectation. And just let
we remind you that the new regulatory frame, where the new price started last year in the
last quarter, just to be very clear. I think, I answered – I covered all the questions. Thank
you.

Q - Maura Garbero

{BIO 2163705 <GO>}
