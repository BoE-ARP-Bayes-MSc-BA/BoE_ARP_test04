{BIO 3974076 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone. And welcome to this Third Quarter Presentation for the
Gjensidige. My name is Mitra Negard, and I'm Head of Investor Relations. As always, we
will start with our CEO, Helge Leiro Baastad, who will give you the highlights of the
quarter; followed by our CFO, Jostein Amdal, who will go through the numbers in further
detail. And as usual, we have plenty of time for Q&A towards the end. Helge, please.

} Good morning, Good morning, and welcome everyone. I hope you are healthy and well.
We are very happy to continue breaking records for our results, thanks to of our solid
brand, eﬃcient operations, and dedicated employees, who put strong eﬀorts in serving
our customers every day.
Let's turn to Page 2 for some comments on our very solid third-quarter results. We
generated a solid before -- proﬁt before tax or NOK2,022 million, of which NOK1,804
million in underwriting result. This is the best third quarter and writing result in our history.
Earned premium rose by a healthy 8.2% or 9.1% in local currency. This (Technical Diﬃculty)

reﬂects strong operations, eﬀective pricing measures, good risk selection and stringent
cost control.
We continued improving our proﬁtability through both strong growth and very eﬃcient
operations. Our cost discipline remains strong, as you can see from the ratio of 13.6% for
the quarter. We generated (Technical Diﬃculty) the ﬁnancial result of NOK207 million,
reﬂecting the turbulent market conditions during the quarter. And our return on equity
came to a very good 26.9%. (Technical Diﬃculty) stand we will revert with more detailed
comments on the results for the quarter.
Then turning to Page 3. As you saw from our release this morning, the Board has decided
to distribute a special dividend of NOK4 per share, related to excess capital release. This
is in line with our dividend policy and our practice over many years. The payment of this
special dividend is pending approval from the FSA as it will bring our payout on the 2020
results above the threshold of 100%. We expect the FSA to approve this and we'll revert
with the relevant key dates as soon as we get their decision.

Bloomberg Transcript

Then turning to Page 4, a few words about our operations. Staying ahead of claims,
inﬂation is key to maintaining good proﬁtability and has a high priority with us. Inﬂation
has picked up during the past months as a result of supply shortages and high demand
for many products. This price increase for construction materials and spare parts for cars
is so far in line with what we expected when we spoke about this in July, in connection
with our second quarter earnings release.
Repair costs were not impacted during the third quarter. However, we expect this to
gradually become apparent in claims inﬂation from the fourth quarter lasting well into
2022. And we are prepared, we expect an increase in claims inﬂation for private property
in Norway to be around 5% to 6%, and for motor at 4% to 6%. Both driven to a larger
extent by material prices, although for motor the increase is somewhat limited due to a
stronger kroner and we expect labor costs to rise modestly.
In response to this, we are adjusting over tariﬀs accordingly and we will continue to raise
prices for private property insurance in Norway well above expected claims inﬂation. For
motor, we will continue to raise prices at least in line with claims inﬂation. We are
comfortable that we will be able to put through the necessary price increases given over
strong market position and the fact that this impacts the whole industry.
We expect claims inﬂation to rise in Denmark as well for the same reasons, and we will not
compromise on proﬁtability. Therefore, we will put through necessary price increases. The
extent, reach and duration of the inﬂation pressure the world is experiencing now is
uncertain. We cannot rule cannot rule out that the current rate of claims inﬂation will pick
up or lost for a while. It can impact more than just materials. Most importantly, labor costs,
and claims for personal injuries. This would impact the whole industry. And once again,
thanks to our strong market position and agile capabilities, we expect to continue staying
ahead of and pricing at least in line with expected claims inﬂation.

FINAL

Sales in private Norway have been strong this quarter too. Business volumes are up and
we have managed to continue to put through necessary price increases while further
increase in customer retention. The commercial segment has also continued the good
development through the third quarter with strong renewals adding new business and
putting through necessary price increases. Retention has risen even higher to 92%. Going
forward, we will continue to raise prices beyond claims inﬂation for certain pockets in the
large corporate portfolio in the commercial segment to further improve proﬁtability.
The market continues to be hard, so we expect to be able to put this through. The strong
momentum in Denmark continues with good premium growth and higher proﬁtability.
The NEM transaction was completed earlier this month and we are very excited to
commence partnership with particularly to saving banks in Denmark. And they have
expanded our partnership network by entering into an agreement with Home, a leading
Danish's real estate broker. This will further strengthen our position for private property
insurance in Denmark.

Bloomberg Transcript

We have moved forward with our new core IT system, which is now applied for selected
areas of new sales. Migration of existing private customers has just started, and after
completion will be followed by including commercial insurance lines. We are convinced
about the beneﬁts of the new system and look forward to generate eﬃciency gains from
next year.
Proﬁtability in Sweden is improving. As mentioned earlier, we are fully focused on
transforming over Swedish business to become a more digital insurance provider. Our
ambition is to deliver excellent customer experiences to digital services and high degree
or automated internal processes. We look forward to speaking more about our plans and
measures at our Capital Markets day in November. Results in the Baltic's are weak and far
from satisfactory. We have a clear ambition to improve results there, with the particular
focus on distribution, pricing and claims handling processes.
Then over to Page 5, and a few comments on our latest product development and
sustainability initiatives. Starting from January, NCD will contribute to safer property
transactions for home buyers, selling to real estate agents by providing new ownership
change insurance in Norway. This product is adapted to new regulation, which will come
into eﬀect from January, protecting buyers to a higher extent than earlier. We expect this
product to be in strong demand, catering to the seller's liability for hidden defects or
deﬁciencies.
We are happy to announce several new sustainability measures to this quarter. Firstly, a
great achievement which has been followed up by several peers. And Syria has lifted the
damage threshold for condemnation of vehicles by 20% to 80% of the vehicles
replacement value. This is now a new standard for the industry in Norway. With this, we
introduced waste and climate footprint in claims processes. We also expect to simplify
claims processes and reduce the time taken for claims settlement.
Another initiative is our People Way Project in Denmark, providing our largest suppliers
with tools to improve eﬃciency in their claims handling. We are very happy to see that it

has proven successful, with the suppliers having achieved higher customer and the
employee satisfaction as well as lower repair cost.
In terms of service development, we have expanded our Helsehjelp 24/7 product with the
digital physiologist therapy available for all private customers in Norway. We continuously
monitor EU regulations related to sustainability. We are preparing for reporting according
to the EU taxonomy from 2022 among others by amending product deﬁned services
tariﬀs and damage prevention initiatives.
Mental health among the youth is an important area for Gjensidige. The group has
established a common project together with Gjensidigestiftelsen, the foundation, which
will over the next three to ﬁve years work on implementing measures to improve live
skills. Within Gjensidige, the project is initializing several initiatives, most recently added
by agreement to support two Norwegian organizations, MOT and Ungt Entreprenorskap,
which have a strong base in primary schools.
With that, I will leave the word to Jostein to present the ﬁrst quarter results in more detail.

Hi, everyone. Apparently we have some problem showing you the slides as we present
the results. We will take a very short break to check this up and be back with you in a very
few -- in a very short time.

Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Thank you. Sorry for the discontinuation. But we'll try to continue on Slide 7. If the slides
don't show up, then I'll refer to the slide numbers.
We delivered a proﬁt before tax of NOK2,022 million in the third quarter, which is slightly
below the third quarter of last year. Our underwriting result was up NOK292 million. And
the pension business also contributed within improvement. However, our ﬁnancial result
was signiﬁcantly lower than the third quarter of last year, reﬂecting the somewhat
turbulent markets, particularly in September. Good premium growth and improved
proﬁtability drove the strong improvement in our underwriting results.
Our Danish operations and commercial in Norway were the main contributors for the
improved results, and the private in Sweden also contributed to the increase. The Baltic
segment generated lower results. We estimate a COVID impact on claims to approximate
NOK64 million, or 0.9 percentage points on the gross rate for the third quarter.
With these restrictions lifted in Nordics, we expect activity to return to more normal levels,
and hence COVID impacts on claims are expected to gradually come down to zero. It was,
of course, diﬃcult to predict the long-term impact from the pandemic on customer
behavior or the risk picture. But so far, there are no major changes to that.

Turning to Page 8. Current events are up 8.2% or 9.1% adjusted for current FX. All
segments record the higher premiums in local currencies. We saw strong increase in
premiums for the private segment, driven by price increases for motor, property and
accident, and accidental health insurance, as well as high volumes for motor insurance.
We also increased the number of customers, it maintained our strong market position and
competitiveness. Demand for travel insurance is still picking up and we're already in line
with pre-pandemic levels. There are some premiums in the commercial segment followed
eﬀective pricing measures, solid renewals and portfolio growth. Including one new large
contract included from the ﬁrst quarter.
All the main product lines in this segment recorded higher premiums. In Denmark,
premiums increased for both the commercial and private segments. The premium growth
in the private segment was primarily due to growth in change of ownership insurance,
driven by continued strong housing markets. The premium growth in the commercial
segment mainly reﬂects volume growth in all lines of business and price increases in the
workers compensation product line. Travel insurance volumes were up year-on-year, but
received below pre-pandemic levels.

Bloomberg Transcript

Earned premium to Sweden measured in local currency increased by 0.8%, mainly due to
volume growth and price increases in the commercial portfolio. This was slightly oﬀset by
volume decrease in the private portfolio. The rise in premiums in the Baltic's was mainly
driven by health, motor and property insurance lines. Travel insurance volumes increased
signiﬁcantly compared to the same period of last year, but they were still below prepandemic levels.
Turning over to Page 9. The loss ratio for the third quarter improved further, down 1.9
percentage points to a very strong level of 62.4%. Large losses were ﬂat with a normal
level signiﬁcantly below our expectations for a quarterly average. Run-oﬀ gains were
somewhat higher than both the third quarter of last year and planned releases. The
underlying frequency loss ratio improved by 1.4 percentage points with the ﬁxed eﬀective
pricing measures and good risk selection being the main drivers.
Adjusted for the eﬀects of COVID-19, the underlying frequency loss ratio improved by 1.6
percentage points. We continue to improve our key ﬁgures in all segments excluding the
Baltic's, and are happy with both direction of development and the level of proﬁtability.
We however sometimes seen the improvements also in Sweden, and although the third
quarter generally is the best quarter and the relatively scale we have in Sweden means
there will be higher volatility in quarter -- quarterly results there. The proﬁts we're
reporting our quite good, and we're optimistic about the development going forward.
The Baltic's has a very clear upside potential, we'll continue to implement measures to
increase growth and improve operations going forward, and look forward to speak more
about this at our Capital Markets Day in November.
So, let's turn to Page 10. We recorded NOK1,024 million operating expenses in the
quarter. Our cost ratio moved further down by 0.3 percentage points to 13.6%. And
excluding Baltic's, the cost ratio was 13% for the quarter. The main driver of this

Page 5 of 25

Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2021-10-20

FINAL

improvement is our premium group and strong cost discipline in the group. Our low-cost
ratio in Norway came further down by 0.1 percentage points, 10.9%. Denmark recorded
0.4 percentage points decrease in the cost ratio to 13.6, driven by good premium growth.
We expect the new core IT system to contribute to further cost eﬃciency in Denmark,
when the system is fully up and running for all products and customers. The cost ratio in
our Swedish business decreased by 0.4 percentage points coming to 7% for the quarter.
The Cost ratio in the Baltic's increased by 0.7 percentage points, driven by provisions
related to higher sales volume.
A few comments on the pension operations on Slide 11. The pre-tax proﬁt came to NOK55
million up year-on-year, reﬂecting growth in the business. Assets under management
continue to grow, reaching NOK48 billion in the third quarter. And less return next to us
14.3%. The sales and margin at the end of the quarter was 152.4%. So far, the introduction
of individual pension account gas not let to any signiﬁcant change in the market
dynamics. Further, it is prudent to expect some pressure on the proﬁtability in the short to
medium term. We and all the other players in Norway are in the process of transferring
policies and expected to be completed towards the end of this year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Moving on to the Investment Portfolio on Page 12. Our Investment Portfolio generates a
moderate return of 0.3% in third quarter. The March portfolio returned 0.5%, a mixed
development for the diﬀerent asset classes in the free portfolio resulted in zero return for
this portfolio in the quarter.
Market movements during the quarter reﬂected moderation of expectations for economic
growth and somewhat increased expectations for inﬂation. Returns on cyclical assets such
as equities were tempered, although there are dispersion across the markets. Some
increase in interest rates and somewhat lower credit margins also impacted returns. Our
private equity holdings performed well, reﬂecting higher market valuations. Returns on
the property investments were also good, reﬂecting the strong commercial real estate
market in Norway.
Over to Page 13. Our capital position is very strong, with the solvency ratio 182% at the
end of the quarter. The ratio is down 30 percentage points from the end of the second
quarter, with the main drivers being especial dividend NOK4 per share and redemption
of our Tier 1 loan of NOK1 billion in September. Solvency II earnings remained strong and
vital result, contributed positively to the loan funds. Our capital requirements rose as a
result of growth in our P&C and pension business, as well as higher market risk, holding
increased exposure to convertible bonds and increased market risk (inaudible)
functioning perfectly.
The Pensjonsforsikring transaction in Denmark was closed earlier this month. Together
with the closing of the all company transactions, which we also expect will be carried out
in the fourth quarter, these factors will bring down our solvency margin by 5 percentage
points, all other things equal.

FINAL

Finally, a few words on the last -- latest development of our operational targets on Slide
14. I'm very pleased with the progress on operational targets this quarter. By delivering on
these operational targets, we continue to improve our competitive position and lay the
ground for future proﬁtability. Customer satisfaction continues to be at a very high level.
Retention in Norway is slightly up from last quarter from the already very high level. And
retention outside Norway has improved slightly in Denmark and Sweden, and is
somewhat down in the Baltic's.
The third is our target on sales eﬀectiveness based on running 12 months at 23%,
compared with our base line year of 2017, driven by cost of good sales and stringent cost
control. The share of automated tariﬀs is stable compared to the level of last quarter, and
we currently stand at around 55%. Progress is good and we will continue to include more
progress going forward, in addition to further deﬁning tariﬀs already included.
On the claims handling side, digital claims reporting has gone slightly up this quarter and
has reached the target of 80%, and the share of claims handled fully automatically has
improved as well. For claims processed to be deﬁned as fully automated, no human
interaction is required. We will continue to develop these Digital Services further to the
remaining of 2021 and onwards.
We have reduced claims costs further and exceeded the target even more this quarter,
with procurement and insurance fraud prevention making the largest contribution to the
increase. I'll then hand over back to Helge.

Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

} Thank you. Yes, then to sum up on Page 15. We are very pleased with the strong results
we continue to deliver. We will continue to focus on growth in our markets. Together with
strong and eﬃcient operations, this is the prerequisite to continue delivering solid results
and attractive returns. We are committed to having a strong capital discipline and our
solvency position is very robust, also after distribution of yet another special dividend.
The economic prospects in the -- our Nordics markets are encouraging, and the pricing
environment continue to be very good. This together without strong product oﬀering and
eﬃcient operations lay the ground for continued strong results going forward. Thus, we
are conﬁdent that we will deliver on all our ﬁnancial targets this year.
Let's turn then to our ﬁnal page in the presentation. A quick reminder of our Capital
Market Day on the 24th of November. We are looking forward to this opportunity to speak
about our ambitions and plans, and we hope you will watch our webcast and participate
in our Q&A sessions.
And with that, we will now open for the Q&A sessions of this presentation. Thank you.

(Question And Answer)

FINAL

Thank you. (Operator Instructions). We will take the ﬁrst question from Alexander Evans
from Credit Suisse.

Q - Alexander Evans

{BIO 19956412 <GO>}

Hi, Helge. Hi, Jostein. Congrats on the record result and thanks for taking my questions.
Maybe just on the underlying frequency loss ratio, you mentioned that down 1.6
percentage points, adjusting for COVID. If we focus on the Norwegian portfolio, you
mentioned the higher price again in property and in pockets of commercial. Is that's
what's driving the improvement here?

Bloomberg Transcript

And then are you ﬁnding it easier to put through higher rates in other lines like motor as
well? Or is that just risk selection is improving? I'm just trying to understand the sense of
the outlook that we should expect in the Norwegian portfolio?
And then secondly, just on the split between volumes and premiums -- volumes and
price. Could you give a little bit of a split on the private commercial lines? And how do
you think your market share has been developing here? And then just ﬁnally on -- sort of
on the growth angle. Obviously, you got very strong organic growth. What does the
NOK4 special mean for your growth ambitions outside of Norway? And you still perhaps
feel a need to catch up on deals given what we've seen with Tryg and Alm. Brand?
Thanks.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

} I can maybe start some general comments and Jostein can give you some more
information about underlying frequency claims to open it. In Norway, we are now very
pleased with the proﬁtability in private. Motor is at good level and when we talk about
price and volume, it's a -- as we communicated of the second quarter, it's a 50/50 mix
between volume and price driven growth, if you're taking market shares or not. I think
that's lagging. After second quarter, I think we were stable or up maybe 0.1%. That's right?

A - Mitra Hagen Negard

{BIO 3974076 <GO>}

It's ﬂat compared to what we had in the second quarter.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

} Yes. So we are in a very good position when it comes to the private proﬁtability. As you
know, we have communicated price increases above claims inﬂation for property for a
while. And property proﬁtability has improved and we will continue pricing up property
insurance beyond the index.
Commercial, we are very pleased with the improvement in proﬁtability and it's highly
customized price initiatives and measures within our commercial business and still it's
Page 8 of 25

Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2021-10-20

pockets, where we will price above index for commercial business in Norway.

FINAL

Volume-price, I commented the mix between volume and price driven growth of cars or
motor. When it comes to private property, it's a good mix between volume and price
driven growth also there, but it's mainly price driven for private property.
Yes. And underlying frequency claims development, Jostein, maybe you have some
comments on that.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

And I think, Alex, your question was mainly related to the commercial, if I understood you
correctly, where we are seeing -- in which areas, where we see the small pieces have
increased. Prices aren't -- if I understood you correctly, that in commercial, I think we have
in general priced above expected claims inﬂation for all lines of business. So it's -- I think
it's wrong to point that one speciﬁc pocket, is what we've said in the previous quarterly
presentations and still continues to hold this, that we see the need more to price up in the
larger end of the spectrum for larger customers rather than the SME part, reﬂecting the
diﬀerence in proﬁtability there.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, I think, I'll stop there in terms of being more speciﬁc on the commercial guidance. If
you look at the improvement in the underlying frequency loss, it's driven by good risk
selection and the price increases that they have seen and if you see they have 1.4
percentage points improvement year-over-year on the commercial -- in the commercial
area in Norway.
And you have the last question about dividends. And what that exactly feels and things in
terms of ambition for growth, I would say no. We still have room, we believe for
bottleneck acquisitions, given the (inaudible) we have and generating capacity that we
continuously have. And if there is something big, we will, as earlier, revert to the capital
markets for ﬁnancing. So it's -- and our strategic agenda and M&A ambition is -- remains
the same.

Q - Alexander Evans

{BIO 19956412 <GO>}

Thank you very much, everyone.

Operator
We'll now take the next question from Hakon Astrup from DNB Markets.

Q - Hakon Astrup

{BIO 18861149 <GO>}

} Good morning. Two questions from me. The ﬁrst one on inﬂation. So just based on your
judgment, have you so far seen any repricing activity on the back of the current
inﬂationary pressures on materials, except either from you or from peers? That was the
ﬁrst question.

Page 9 of 25



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2021-10-20

And the second question on run-oﬀ, just on (inaudible) if you at some point will provide
some guidance to indicate levels you expect for run-oﬀs in 2023 for instance on your
Capital Markets Day next month?

FINAL

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

} Good morning, Hakon. Claims inﬂation has been the big topic for many months now.
And I think I commented that -- during my presentation that, we do not have any change
in our expected claims inﬂation prospects going forward, compared to what we said in
July. And I also commented that we do not see the surge in prices in our Q3 repair costs.
When it comes to pricing, I think -- I said that we think the market is still hard and we are
moving towards end of the year and lots of renewals. So, I think this topic is the main topic
for all of our peers also. And as I said, we do not -- it's claims inﬂation for material and of
course, it's also problems and bottlenecks in the supply chain.
And with that uncertainty, we think and we had seen price increases around us. So we still
see the markets hard and we expect this to be hard into 2022 as well.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Yes. If I may ﬁll in, I mean, this is something we are keeping on the extremely close track
on a very decentralized detailed level. And we are fairly conﬁdent that our terms with the
suppliers is, given our size and the work we do here, are best in Norway, although we -and we don't have a ﬁxed price, but I think we have the best price for our materials. And if
you look at the numbers for the third quarter, there is no sign of any speciﬁc spike in
inﬂation for our imports.
But as Helge mentioned in the -- in his presentation there just a few minutes ago, we are
monitoring this very closely because we do see globally that there are signs of disturbing
and we need to be ahead of that. And the ﬁrst line of defense there is, of course that we
do increase prices somewhat above our expectation or claims inﬂation.
Run-oﬀ in 2023, I can only repeat what we've said for so many quarters now. We have a
planned run-oﬀ release until the end of 2022 of approximately NOK1 billion based on
speciﬁc lines of business and vintage risk going back 2008-2014. And then we do reserve
according to best estimate for all new claims that occur. I think that is the message.

Q - Hakon Astrup

{BIO 18861149 <GO>}

So if I understood you correctly there, you will not provide any guidance with regards to
the run-oﬀs level after 2022. Is that correct?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

No. I think the only possible guidance given the accounting regime is an expectation of
zero and then you will have for yourself look back at what has typically been the run-oﬀ
patterns. Of course, these are -- we are talking about, say, NOK30 billion of technical

Page 10 of 25



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2021-10-20

reserves that are estimated based on expectations of future claims going as far ahead as
40 years and there is uncertainty around that.

FINAL

And on average, I think there's been a slight degree of conservatism in how these claims
have been reserved, but the accounting principle is best estimate and hence expectation
of zero we will take.

Q - Hakon Astrup

{BIO 18861149 <GO>}

} Thank you. That was very clear.

Operator
We'll now take the next question from Will Hardcastle from UBS.

Q - Will Hardcastle

{BIO 22230376 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just following up on that run-oﬀ, you said it's
coming -- the surplus run-oﬀ coming to an end in 2022. Can you say anything about how
the reserve -- spot reserves are now compared to where you initially announced risk level
of (inaudible) per annum? Have they sort of trended exactly in line with what you've
assumed? I presume so because that's what's coming through in your solvency, but just to
be clear on that.
And the second one, how should we think about your solvency level now within the
range? Is it fair to simply say, post the acquisition completions, you're broadly now at the
midpoint of the range, and that's why you feel most comfortable. And so, we should think
about distributions each year to land around this level? Is that a fair assumption? Thank
you.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

I will -- just a slightly blurred line, Will. But if I understand you correctly, you're asking
about this originally planned pool of run-oﬀ gains that we communicated, well that has
changed over the course of the year. Is that correct?

Q - Will Hardcastle

{BIO 22230376 <GO>}

Yes. Whiles the reserve (inaudible) is broadly -- expected when you initially set it?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Yes. It has been -- there has been no changes in the degree of signiﬁcance in that
investment of those interest rates. They have run-oﬀ as planned. And of course, on
average over the last year, we actually also had a slightly positive run-oﬀ gain on top of
that due to normal volatility in numbers. And as I said in my response to Hakon's
questions earlier, that there is -- it's a typical tendency to be somewhat conservative
reserves, but that is something we guide for. But the solvency level -- we have reported
related to after these transactions, that they are -- have completed and are expected to
complete in Q4. It would have been 177% at the end of the third quarter.

FINAL

And then of course, you also need to remember that the formulaic coming from
subtraction of 80% of the proﬁt after tax, which is already included in the solvency
calculation. We have a solvency ratio of 150 to 200. We are comfortable within that. The
mid-range is a -- it's a nice enough place to stay but our dividend policy is high and stable
nominal dividends on the ordinary dividend. And if that's kind of -- if underlying proﬁts
increase, we also intend to increase the regular dividend.
And then if there is kind of excess capital building up due to proﬁts or one-time eﬀects,
then that would be considered for a special dividend, as we have done for a number of
years now.

That's brilliant. And if I may just follow up on the solvency. Was there any model
approvable within the quarter in terms of moving the models closer together?

Q - Ulrik Ardal Zurcher

{BIO 19208986 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you. I only have one question left now. You mentioned a lot of times during the
presentation that you will not compromise on proﬁtability, but little bit depending on how
we calculate seasonal eﬀects there, it looks like you're 5 to 10 percentage points too low
on your combined ratio versus your target. So does this mean that you're targeting a
combined ratio in the low 80s instead of the low 90s, excluded run-oﬀ claims now?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

} I think it's fair to say, Ulrik, that we have the ﬁnancial targets that we have, and if you join
the Capital Markets Day in November, I guess we will elaborate around ﬁnancial targets
going forward. And you have to know that seasonality in the business, we are in the
strong situation now and when we talk about ﬁnancial targets, it's long-term ﬁnancial
targets, so we will come back in more detail in November on that.

FINAL

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning. And well done on the numbers, guys. I've got three questions,
I think, just on inﬂation. And are you seeing labor shortages in the Norwegian labor
market, that's being seen in other countries? And is that a possible driver of wage
inﬂation? Maybe just comment around that, what's going on in the Norwegian labor
market?
Secondly, if you do see any impacts of inﬂation over and above your existing guidance, is
that something that will impact the existing reserving position of the companies? Is that
something that we might need to look at the existing assumptions for inﬂation, if you do
see a spike up in inﬂation over and above your expectations?
And ﬁnally just focusing on that 13.8% increase in commercial premiums, could you
maybe unpack that a little more? You talked about one large contract and just trying to
get a handle on whether that's been driven by volume gains or price. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

} I'll take the ﬁrst one and Jostein to second one there. We haven't seen any labor
shortage in third quarter. And as I said, we haven't seen this aﬀected us in the third
quarter ﬁgures. Going forward, we have seen this internationally, but supply chain
problems can create bottlenecks for spare parts. Then we are talking about motor
insurance. As you know, the chips for electrical cars is a problem and this can delay
repairs and increase the cost, for example, for high usage of rental cars, et cetera, et
cetera. So going forward, this is strongly focused when we are working with our suppliers
and with price measures going forward, but we haven't seen anything in the Norwegian
markets so far. Really, it's labor --

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Yes. Just interested to know why you think that. Just Helge, why do you think the
Norwegian market is not seeing labor shortages, but others are? Any thoughts?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

} It can be lots of reasons for that. It may come. We are in the same situation as an -- other
countries. But in our ﬁgures, our claims during the third quarter, we haven't seen this as a
problem so far, but it may come, Blair.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

And it's also from there could be diﬀerent sector hits at diﬀerent times (inaudible)
In terms of your second part on the inﬂationary -- potential eﬀects of an increase in
inﬂation on the reserves. It's related to the question about wages versus material inﬂation
Page 13 of 25

FINAL

because materials (inaudible) we see in the inﬂationary spikes in the kind of in the -- or
increases so far. And that's mainly hitting short tail of business with -- meaning, fairly in a
short time from it can happens to when it's speed up, so the inﬂationary eﬀect is not that
as big there and risk areas, of course, on the personal injuries that underlying wage
inﬂation, which again aﬀects the government base amount in the longer term. And then,
there is an obvious risk that if there is a prolonged wage inﬂation, this might aﬀect their
serving level on the personal injury lines.
We reserve according to our own forecast of this going forward in the longer term, but if
that is wrong forecast, then there is a risk to the reserve as well. I think having said that, we
have -- we are fairly conﬁdent that we have enough reserves and have this kind of
provisions for some of the increases in somewhat increased wage inﬂation in the long
term.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Are you able to say what your assumption for wage inﬂation is within your reserves or is a
range of assumptions?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

That's not something we disclosed.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Thank you. And just on that 13.8% premium increase in commercial.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

It's -- we are not disclosing the (inaudible) one contract mentioned than disclosing the
exact numbers there. But then it takes that away, it's still a very large increase in earned
premiums for the commercial segment. And it's spread evenly across all products really,
and in segments, both small and large customers. And it's a mixture of both pricing and
volume eﬀects within commercial.
We are also winning new customers there, so, it's net. So, I think it's a combination of our - kind of very good competitive position and also the competitors need to do something
about their proﬁtability levels because they are behind us in the repricing curve, and
makes -- gives us room to do the same and we did actually see in the numbers.

FINAL

Yes, good morning. One question left from us as well. On the inﬂation side, when you talk
to your suppliers, when do they hike the price during next year? And what kind of impact
would that have for you? Is it sort of that you will have it early in the year, in the middle of
the year, running for another three years or how should we read that on your inﬂation side
that's sort of are now ahead on premiums growth? But maybe inﬂation is coming behind
you, as you say, and you are preparing for it with higher prices, but how should we read
into your supply chain on the diﬀerent side, motor, property, health, et cetera? Thank you.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

I think the ﬁnal part of your question there highlights the complexity in oﬀering that
because it's extremely varied between the diﬀerent lines of business and what type of
suppliers you're talking about. So to give a general answer to that is -- in general, I would
say it's dynamic. We are typically going into the new year, a larger share of supply
agreements are signed at the end -- in the beginning of the year. We do not book prices
as such for a number of years going forward, but we have ﬁxed margins on the certain
types of suppliers. But this varies so much between kind of property, garages or repair
shops on the car side. And what we do on the health side. So it's very hard to give a one
speciﬁc answer to that, Jan Erik.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

If you could take the largest one or (inaudible) if it's so that you typically have diﬀerent
agreements with the diﬀerent suppliers or garages are all falling due on 1st of January or
is so that you have spread evenly through the year?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

That is the larger share, now being renegotiated in the -- at -- in the fourth quarter and
applying for the next year. But then and also on the motor side, there is fewer
counterparties than on the property side, because there are exchanged and the larger
suppliers. So it's a more the way transparent market what's going on there.
And if speciﬁc prices on -- yes, in a very detailed level of speciﬁc parts and services that
they do in (inaudible).

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay. Just one follow-up. Last time, you have said that you did not see any large inﬂation
on painting, wooden ﬂoors, and concrete, et cetera. Has that changed now? Since
wooden materials, et cetera have sort of -- it was not part of the -- biggest part of your
repair cost.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

That's correct. And we see on average we say that, the expected future trend in fashion in
-- on the property side, I think we said around 5% last quarter maybe -- I think it's maybe
5% to 6%, is kind of our estimate now. Based on where we see, after a very detailed
analysis of the diﬀerent parts that go into taking a typical claim. But for motor, I think we
said 4% to 5% of the second quarter and today we say 4% to 6% so, and the -- our ﬁrst line
Page 15 of 25



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA

of defense regarding these this future is price increases above this claim inﬂation level. I
think, that's the situation for the whole market also.

FINAL

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Absolutely. What do you see from smaller peers which sort of do not have the sort of
advanced pricing ambiguity? Are they sort of trying to pick up customers these days
because they have lower price than you? Or is it so that they are just afraid and just
pricing up everywhere and claims come back to you?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

} If they are afraid or not, I don't know. But when I talk to the sales reps and the
distribution, they are talking about our main peers, (inaudible) Tryg, so that's the large
one. The situation we had several years ago, with lots of small players, I do not hear that
much about them at the moment. And we do not see them either.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Thomas Svendsen

{BIO 6070863 <GO>}

Yes, good morning. Could you talk a little bit more about this new change-of-ownership
market? What do you think about the potential market size there? Is it more liabilities to
ensure, so it will be bigger than the old change-of-ownership market? And what do you
think about your market share, and how are you going to distribute this new insurance?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Yes. I mean ﬁrst of all, this is I would say good news for consumers and insurance
companies, is in our view better regulation of these transactions since are extremely
important for an ordinary person's life and also, the record increased requirements for,
what you call it, surveyor reports on the houses before tax rates also very good because it
takes down the risk and clearly -- and more clearly than before, states where the
regulation start, we have, as you know, not been part of the change-of-ownership
insurance market in Norway under the previous regime, but we will now oﬀer our changeof-ownership product.
We have extensive experience with this in Denmark, which I think is slightly a model for
the new -- to certain extent at least a model for the renovation regulation as well and we
are actually leading in Denmark in this area. We -- the main distribution channel for this
product will be through --

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Yes, real estate agents. So, it's impairment to have agreements with this real estate agents
for the distribution. But we will not comment on the speciﬁc market share targets,
something like that. But this is in a way, it's good news, it's more to be insured and it's well
regulated since -- regulated product and the type of risk which we are well used to look
at.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

which included in total markets for this change-of-control products. It's a good for the
total market development.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Yes. And of course, there will be an introduction of variable costs to consumers and the
insurance companies need to be well acquainted with the new products and the risks that
are in it, but I'm not that stressed about the risks -- it's ordinary property risk, and it also
ﬁts well into the ordinary property product because we don't have more risk information
about the objects that we insure.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

} Finally, I think it's important to really have control for -- regarding pricing, as you know,
this is a ﬁve-year products and that's the main diﬀerence between this change-of-control
ownership product and motor, property and other one-year risk products. So you have to
really know what you're doing when you price this and as Jostein said, we had a really
good and strong experience from Denmark.

Q - Thomas Svendsen

{BIO 6070863 <GO>}

Okay. But do you think it will be -- is it possible to say or to try to think it will be bigger
than the whole market or is it fair to say, it will be smaller number than whole market just
because you do a much more check of the real estate before you sell it, or is it impossible
to say?

property products. Is it so that construction cost index is the starting point or basis for
your repricing discussions?

A - Jostein Amdal

It's -- I would say, yes, for the average of the portfolio.

Q - Vegard Toverud

{BIO 17129809 <GO>}

Okay. And then --

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Yes, it's a starting point, but please remember, our -- kind of our analysis or this
presentation that we gave in the second quarter in terms of how much is material and
how much is wage. And then, you have the estimates on wage increase, which are still
fairly moderate I would say. We're talking about maybe some 3% expected wage inﬂation
going forward. And then, the remaining part which is say 80% -- 75%, 80% of the total
(inaudible) risk wages and the remaining 15 -- 20%, 25% is material. And besides the
overall mix of that, we do expect some 5% to 6% claims inﬂation going forward.

Q - Vegard Toverud

{BIO 17129809 <GO>}

And when I take the latest numbers and use the same share for materials and labor, I get
to somewhat higher number. Is the reason for your number being lower that you further
divide this into even more gradual parts and your material consumption is diﬀerent from
that of the index?

A - Jostein Amdal

Q - Faizan Lakhani

{BIO 20034558 <GO>}

Morning. Congratulations on a very good set of results. I have three questions. The ﬁrst
question is on the Swedish business. So, the improvement in the Swedish loss rate -underlying frequency loss ratio this quarter was particularly strong, especially when you
compare it to a year-to-date picture. Now I appreciate some of that is sort of volatility and
seasonality, but can you just elaborate on more what drivers of this were? And just more
broadly, what is the level that you'd be happy to operate out in Sweden?
And the second question is, if I remember correctly at the half year, it was mentioned that
pricing in Denmark is slightly below claims inﬂation. However, if you look at the
improvement quarter-to-quarter appears to quite robust. How should we square the two?
And the ﬁnal question is on run-oﬀ. So, Danish run-oﬀ was very strong. Please provide
some information on what lines of business this has come from?

And just coming back to the link between inﬂation reserves, are you allowing for higher
levels of inﬂation for year 2021 accident year, relative to what you reserved in previous
years? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

I'll start with this -- the two ﬁrst ones, and then I'll -- I might need to get some help from
you to rephrase the third one. But in Sweden, yes, we do have a very strong quarter-overquarter improvement, but we see this trend now also in the -- towards the end of the
previous quarter that the improvement was underway in Sweden. And as I said in my
presentation then, we are actually more optimistic about development in Sweden now.
But third quarter is easily the best and given the size today, there is more short-term
volatility in the -- also in the underlying results in the Swedish portfolio and the other
businesses.
Having said that, I mean, the improvements you see now is based on improved risk
selection, probably especially in the commercial portfolio and also, that we managed to
get to the price increases that we were hoping to get through there. So it's the result of an
ongoing eﬀort for the last one to two years, let's say, in improving the quality of the
portfolio. And at the Capital Markets Day, we will talk a bit more about the overall
turnaround in the Swedish business more than I can do at this moment.

Q - Faizan Lakhani

{BIO 20034558 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Thank you.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Denmark, I think we are aiming to price in line with claims inﬂation at least there as well.
And there has been some focus on the discussion, I would say, between Tryg and the
Financial Services Authority or the Competition Authority, whatever it is, on the degree of
-- on the possibility to get to price increases without notifying customers speciﬁcally. And
the kind of (inaudible) now on pricing, and (inaudible) normal price increases for Danish
private business.

Q - Faizan Lakhani

The improvement is still pretty strong.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Pardon.

Q - Faizan Lakhani

{BIO 20034558 <GO>}

I mean, it is in line with claim inﬂation -- I mean, if it's in line with claims inﬂation, I would
have expected the improvement in underlying frequency loss ratio to be a little bit more
muted than it has been. I mean, it is that just earning through higher premiums from
previous years, and the improvement going forward to be more limited.

-- 1.6% increase in the -- percentage points increase in the underlying claims inﬂation
adjusted to veteran and COVID eﬀects in the Danish business. Combination of price
increases improve risk selection, I would say. But there've always been volatility in
quarterly numbers in non-life insurance. So yes, I think you should probably look at this
over a bit longer term perspective.
And please, if you could please rephrase the third question. I didn't quite catch what you
were asking about there.

Q - Faizan Lakhani

{BIO 20034558 <GO>}

Yes. I mean, in fact, there are two parts. The run-oﬀ in Denmark was very strong and if you
could break down where that came from by line of business? And the second part is just
going back to the inﬂation linked to reserves. Are you allowing for higher levels of
inﬂation in year 2021 accident year relative to your previous accident years?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

On the last part of it, I would say no. We are taking into account both obviously inﬂation
and our claims inﬂation expectations when we set the reserves. So I think we are correct to
our best of our knowledge.
On the ﬁrst part, where the claim run-oﬀ gains in Denmark comes from, we have one part
which is the -- some part from the Workers' Compensation line of business, just going
okay, and then the rest is kind of evenly spread out, I think, the risk to run-oﬀ against both
in motor, property, and various other small lines of businesses as well. So, it's fairly well
spread out during the third quarter.

Q - Derald Goh

{BIO 20775137 <GO>}

Morning, everyone. Just had a couple of questions, please. So the ﬁrst one just stepping
back about inﬂation, but could you maybe talk about what are the inﬂation levels that
you're seeing in Denmark, maybe in the motor and property lines? And related to that, do
you also have the same kind of procurement contract that you do in Norway or what are
the risks do you have there?
And the second question is just on the Baltics. Could you maybe elaborate more about
what is the operational focus there? Because if I look at the underlying loss ratio, it looks
pretty weak. But yet, you seem to be growing volume quite strongly.

Claims inﬂation in Denmark. I think looking at similar levels in Denmark and it's the same
drivers as we see in Norway. So we're talking slightly lower inﬂation -- claims inﬂation in
motor than we see in property. But say it's in the 4% to 6% range.
So, it's also an element in this that we see that we see this is the cost of change for the
typical claim year-over-year, but they're also improvements in risk selection with improved
claims frequency and so on. So there are other parts that move this picture. So, it's -- yes,
if you look at motor and property together, we're talking about the range of, say, 4% to
6%.
And then, your question about the supply, is that -- now I guess it was our focus in the
Baltics. Is that right? You had also question about the supply (Multiple Speakers).

Q - Derald Goh

{BIO 20775137 <GO>}

Sorry. Yes. Sorry, I was just keen to hear about if you had the same kind of procurement
contracts in Denmark, as you do in Norway, or if you have any other levers that you have
to mitigate the inﬂationary pressures.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Yes. Now the procurement contracts are of the same type. It's not the (inaudible) ﬁxed
prices as such. But we have as in Norway very professional claims handling inﬂation that
have best possible contracts with our suppliers there. Of course, we are market leader in
Norway and are the largest buyer or procurer of the large type of things in (inaudible)
element for claims inﬂation, not so in Denmark. But I think we still have very good set of
contracts with our suppliers there, because as we said repeatedly now for the every
quarter, we didn't have ﬁxed price contracts over a number of years.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

} Regarding the Baltics, as Jostein said, we will give more insight into the Swedish and the
Baltic business in November, but we have used the word transforming to a fully digital
provider in Sweden. So that's in Sweden. They are working with the sort of a new type of
business model, while we, in the Baltics, focus on optimizing and continuously improve
what you're doing there. And we look at it and if they manage to operate in the Baltic area
with sort of the same type of business model as we have. So it's about distribution,
including data analytics and price optimization and it's to actually implement lots of
measures as we know that if they manage to operate with the same type, as I said,
business model with best probability level than we have had for a while. But we will give
more insight into that all the measures we are dealing with in the Baltics in November.

Secondly, do you have any Nordic clients that have risks outside the Nordics, for instance,
if there should be ﬂooding in Germany, ﬂooding in France, or anything particular in
England, et cetera, which could hurt them? And is there any opportunities in Denmark
taking either people or clients, when you see now Codan being sort of separated up into
Alm. Brand?
And ﬁnally the 160 basis points underlying breakdown. Could you please break it up into
what kind is price driven? What is average claims driven? And what is frequency driven?

} Regarding the Danish market, Jan Erik, as we have said several times, it's more
fragmented compared to Sweden and Norway. So, we are hunting opportunities in the
Danish market all the time. I will not go into and comment on people and customers and
opportunities related to Alm. Brand. But we are hunting all kinds of opportunities and it's
more fragmented market and we see lots of opportunities that are -And in terms of the Swedish heavy rainfall in (inaudible). We were exposed to have a
book to loss related to that event in our third quarter results. I don't think we've speciﬁed

No. As we discussed in the pre-selling period call, where you can see that this is a limited
number.

} So most aﬀected on Sweden, but on the group level it's nothing much. But we have not
short -- extremely limited exposure to the kind of ﬂoodings that we see in predominant
Europe. We don't have clients with that kind of exposure.
And then the 160 basis points, no, I don't have that breakdown for you, Jan Erik.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Can you tell anything about what would you see underlying there? Is it mainly pricing?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

} For the group level 160.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Yes. Referring back to Thomas' questions about -- sorry, Vegard's question about
proﬁtability.

} I guess it's fair to say, it's more price driven than volume driven, but compared to what
we had communicated for some years now, we had a very solid good balance in the
private segment volume and price and we are really pleased with that good mix.

I think the 1.6 in the underlying. I mean, given that they do price above expected claims
inﬂation, I think it's fair to say that the larger share of that improvement is related to
pricing. And as Helge said earlier, I mean, ﬁrst line of defense in terms of increased claims
inﬂation is decrease prices.
And then, of course, on the quality of tariﬀs is extremely important that we manage to
attract the right risk -- right type of risks to our portfolio and the work we've done over a
number of years in automating tariﬀ process there. Means that we have more time to
analyze and increase the quality of the tariﬀs here and that's I think is -- it's hard to
pinpoint exactly where that pops up. But in the overall picture, I think that's also an
important contributor to our improvements.

Thank you very much for your answers again.
