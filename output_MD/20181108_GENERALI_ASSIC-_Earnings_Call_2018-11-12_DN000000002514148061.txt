Thank you, Leo. Good morning to all of you. I'm Frederic de Courtois and I'm really happy
to talk to you for the first time in my new role as General Manager.

FINAL

This is an important month for Generali. This is an important month because this is the last
quarterly -- set quarterly result before the end of the year and this is the month of our
new strategic plan. So you know that we are going to publish our strategic plan on the 21st
in Milan. And we are looking forward to seeing you in Milan.
A few words on the results. This is a very solid set of results. If we look at the various
components of solid growth, solid technical result and solid solvency despite the market
turmoils. And all of this makes us very confident that we are going to reach all our target
at year-end.
After this short introduction, I pass to Cristiano.

Cristiano Borean

{BIO 15246531 <GO>}

Thank you, Frederic. For me as well, it's a great pleasure to joining you in this call. With you
today in new role, of my recent position as a Group Chief Financial Officer of Generali.

Bloomberg Transcript

As you have seen from our press release, the improvements seen in the first part of the
year on the business side and as well on the capital position are confirmed by today's
results.
So having said that, we are now glad to start talking and taking your questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Peter Eliot of Kepler
Cheuvreux. Please go ahead.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you very much. And -- first question, I just wanted to ask actually how you think that
the solvency -- I mean, I guess as at today, I think your ratio -- solvency ratio should be
benefiting from the country's VA, so it should be a little bit higher than the end of Q3. But
I mean, clearly, that's not an economic benefit.
And then you'd have sort of two definitions of solvency, 20 points apart and not moving
completely in tandem. So I was just wondering if you could shed some light on how you
think that the movements and how -- when BTP spreads widen, the extent to which that
sort of feeds into your thinking as the solvency as a group and that was my first question.

And the second question was, I was just wondering if you could give us any more color on
how you see the prior year developments developing. I mean you commented in the
press release that it was stable for nine-months but I think we had a bit of a pick-up
towards the end of last year. So I was just wondering if there's any more color. And
perhaps if I can ask a third question, you talked about the impact of market volatility on
the realized gains and impairments. I mean obviously Q4 is -- has been a bit more volatile.
So I'm just wondering if you can sort of update us on your thinking there, and what we
should expect. Thank you very much.

A - Cristiano Borean

{BIO 15246531 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Peter. Regarding the first question on solvency, if we look at September and
level of BTPs, we're at the level where the (inaudible) VA adjustment did not enter. So the
figures we are showing you in this solvency ratio published are without any volatility
adjustment triggering for the country part because it was very close but it was not there.
Regarding the movement on deal[ph] days, the country volatility adjustment is really
jiggling around the trigger level. So we are in a kind of binary position. But what I will like to
comment is the movement of the spread widening has been more than counterbalanced
by our solvency capital generation. So basically, the effect are related to economic
variances, which is close to three percentage points, has been more than covered by our
normalized capital generation of the period. Regarding the prior year development we
are as we said stable. And on this topic, we would like to give you more insight and color
during the Investor Day so that I think you can come there and look at what we're going to
say. Related to the third question on your realized gains and impairment, the third quarter
was impacted with some specificities. I think there are not expectation of having less
volatile third quarter versus the fourth. We do not see big differences with respect to that.
Let's say, as you maybe know, the major contributor on that part was our position held in
Banca Monte dei Paschi.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

Operator
We will now take our next question from Thomas Seidl of Bernstein. Please go ahead.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you. Three questions also from my side. First one on the Life operating result
which you grew some EUR10 million Q3 year-on-year. And that despite a drop in return on
investment by some 20 basis points. So I wonder what has allowed you to grow the
operating profit? Was it that we had abnormal low policyholder share in the quarter or did
you fully compensate the 7%, 8% lower investment revised with a better risk and
expenses side? So that's my first question.
Secondly on P&C, you basically say that combined ratio that it's lower year-on-year and
that can be as low as 30 bps. So the underlying loss ratio is pretty stable. But then you say
Page 3 of 12



Company N ame: Assicuraz ioni Generali SpA
Company Ticker: G I M Equity
Date: 2018-11-08

you have EUR90 million of large losses which translate into 1.8 percentage points.

FINAL

My question is, do you imply to say that you have improved the underlying loss ratio
excluding man-made losses by as much as 1.8 percentage point at the half year it
would've been 0.9 percentage points.
And third question on your target RoE, you target 13%, but the ROE -- operating RoE is
trending down since 2015 year-on-year and so my question here is what makes you
confident that you can actually achieve the 13% this year? You are below that at the ninemonth level?

A - Cristiano Borean

{BIO 15246531 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Thomas, for your questions. So first question, regarding Life
operating results, the dynamics there is let's say twofold. The first one is purely technical
and you have the increase in the technical margin you can extract things for our new
structure of products and hybrid products we are selling and in general moving to a more
-- the pure risk part.

Bloomberg Transcript

The second element related to the correlation between the drop in the investment result,
which was coming, as you noticed principally because we reduced the capital gain
realization. How this translated into the policy order share. We are managing this in a local
basis accordingly to the different markets and following the approach to manage properly
this following also our commercial profit-sharing objectives. So this has been managed
according to this.
Second point related to the combined ratio year-over-year, the man-made losses we had,
it's part of the business. I mean, you've seen bad luck. Other peers had a more natural
catastrophe. This is part of a statistical fluctuation around it. We are not inducting an
attritional improvement of that level. We are on the attritional combined ratio. We think we
are sufficiently in line. And when we speak an improvement about the period, we are
always referring to the nine-months '17. Hope I was clear on this.
And regarding your third question on the operating return on equity, when we say that we
are confident to reach the 13% above is the plan period, we are at 13.4% over the plan
period announced on the '15, '18 and we are confident to close this on target due to that.
That was the clarification on this point.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

On the -- for this year basically, you don't see then a need to get to the 30% because
you're -- even if you're below 13%, you'll reach the three-year target?

A - Cristiano Borean

{BIO 15246531 <GO>}

Indeed.

the nine-months '17 on attritional loss ratio and --

Operator
We will now take our next question from Farooq Hanif of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi. Thank you very much. Good morning. Could you go back to the country-specific
volatility adjuster? The comment that you're making suggests that the sensitivity now at
this stage will be lower, further widening. Is there anything you can say quantitatively
around that?
Second question, you've seen a drop in pensions and saving sales in Italy, is this Generaliled or is it also competition-led through the bank assurers? And lastly, so related to that,
are you not tempted to push more traditional product given the high bond yields in Italy,
the ability to lock in what is essentially, from a regulatory point of view, a zero risk-ish, zero
risk asset? Just wondering what your thoughts on that are? Thank you.

A - Cristiano Borean

{BIO 15246531 <GO>}

Hi, Farooq. Thank you for your question. So first question's on country volatility adjustment.
Yes, you are right, in case of triggering the country volatility adjustment, the sensitivity will
be lower. Just -- I recall you, at group level, the 100 basis point movement in BTP now
implies, as we presented you, 12 percentage points of movement in the solvency ratio.
You have to think that in a context where you enter in a country volatility adjustment
regime, you have a drop in the sensitivity. And you can be closer to the seven percentage
points sensitivity.
Regarding the other question in drop in saving and pension in Italy, it is not due to
competition. It is a strategic positioning of the group towards the new capital-light
products. And the competition from the banks is not seen on that due to the strong
distribution capacity with our Asian network. And so it is mainly related to this point. Hope I
clarified your question on this.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Thank you.

Our next question comes from James Shuck. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

FINAL

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. So three questions from my side and apologies, but I'm going
to go back over some of the answers you've given. Firstly, just returning to the combined
ratio and the attritional development, I mean there's quite a fair comment in the press
release that the attritional -- the current year loss ratio excluding that cash actually did
improve year-on-year. So I'm just kind of don't quite squared out with your comment just a
minute ago that it was stable year-on-year. I appreciate there were higher man-made
losses in the period. It looks like about 60 bps -- basis points, across nine-months to me.
So perhaps you could just kind of just expand a little bit on that attritional development in
the period, please.

Bloomberg Transcript

Secondly, there is also -- the technical margin improvement, there's a comment again in
the release that says that there was a technical margin improvement in operating profit of
Life in the third quarter. And that was due to an acceleration in Q3. I presume that's an
acceleration of protection-driven style products, but it's not clear to me what that mix
change has driven and whether we should expect that technical margin to step up as a
result. Is it something to do with the profit signature of the business being solved? Kind of
linked to that, I'm just -- can you just expand a little bit on why the French technical margin
is always negative, around the EUR 400 million, EUR 500 million level, and whether you
expect that to normalize at some stage?
And then the final question, really just to help a little bit around Germany and the Life
operating profit in Germany because in 2017, there was quite a high degree of volatility
that the operating profit trended up quite a lot and you obviously sold Generali Leben. I'm
just finding it difficult to get an underlying view of what the baseline is from 2018 onwards,
please. Thank you very much.

A - Cristiano Borean

{BIO 15246531 <GO>}

So thank you very much, James, for your questions. So the first point, maybe -- sorry, I was
not clear on the point. The attritional part I was referring to was the stability with previous
information which was healthier. Yes, there is a little improvement on that. So thank you for
pointing it out.
Second point on the technical margin improvement in Life, that's the ratio in the quarter,
yes, you have as well some technical element on risk result coming from Germany which is
improving. And clearly, this is part of the repositioning of the new structure. It is also part
of some risk results. So clearly with its own volatility around.
Third question, French technical margin is always negative. You have to -- good point on
this, but you have to be aware that the structure of this is part of a longer restructuring
happened in France related to the technical cost of the so-called longevity, which is part of
the technical margin result, which has been progressively managed and is going to be
managed. And so I'm not expecting to have a permanent negative technical margin
related to how the definition -- how you see it.

And then if you can just re-elaborate your last question on Germany, please, because it
was not really clear to me.

FINAL

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Yes, sure. So just the Life operating profit, I mean recently it's been quite volatile. So 2017,
EUR526 million is kind of up from around the EUR400 million level in previous periods and
H1, H2, the run rate's kind of all over the place. I just -- particularly given the sale of
Generali Leben, I don't really have a feel or any kind of clear way of thinking about what
the normal level of operating profit for Germany is going forward?

A - Cristiano Borean

{BIO 15246531 <GO>}

James, clearly, fair point. We are at nine-months. We are commenting a delta of a single
quarter. I think you need to have better view at year-end results in order to normalize it
properly. But I do get your point. It is true we have a positive result in Germany, and you
have to think about that this is also part of the new repositioning. But let's take another
quarter to have a more stabilized view about this. Fair enough.

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Perhaps you could just tell me what is the lost operating profit from Generali Leben,
please?

A - Cristiano Borean

{BIO 15246531 <GO>}

Sorry, we will not disclose this point.

Q - James Shuck

Okay. Thank you very much, anyway.

Our next question comes from Giuseppe Mapelli of Equita. Please go ahead. Your line is
open.

Q - Giuseppe Mapelli

{BIO 7269722 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning everybody. I have three questions. And the first one is on Motor TPL in
Italy, can you elaborate a little bit more on what's going on in terms of frequency, in terms
of tariff ?
My second question is on rumors reported by some newspaper on the possible novelties
on Motor TPL in Italy that could be foreseen in the budget low, if you have some more
visibility, if you can share with us what's going on there?
And my last question is regarding the situation in Italy from the political standpoint. Are
you affected in terms of client behavior in terms of collection, in particular I am referring to
October and referring to Q3 reproduction? Thank you.

A - Cristiano Borean

{BIO 15246531 <GO>}

FINAL

Thank you, Giuseppe, for your questions. So the first point, related to evolution of Motor
TPL in Italy. As you've seen, there is a point related to the collection, but there is a point of
reverse of trend in the average premium, which is positive. And, coupled with a lower
frequency, which is showing an improvement in loss ratio, this allows us to phase in, in a
positive way, the next round of tariff movement.
On the other side, related to the loans -- on the budget law in Italy, we cannot comment
up to now because it is only hypothesis. We need to see the final version of it before
taking related to the decision. And actually, the political situation in Italy related to unitlinked production, we do -- we are monitoring it constantly, at this point, I have nothing
special to say more than -- about this. I will say nothing more.

Q - Giuseppe Mapelli

Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Johnny Vo

{BIO 5509843 <GO>}

Just a couple of quick questions. Just in regards to the solvency position of the Italian
subs, can you give us an update of where those solvency positions have moved to, post
the move in BTP? And secondly, just in regards to effectively remittances from those
entities, I mean, what are the risks around remittances to the holding company? Thank
you.

A - Cristiano Borean

{BIO 15246531 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Johnny, for your questions. On the solvency position of our Italian
company, I recall you that the starting point is really, really very, very healthy. And our
companies are very well-capitalized about this. On this point, coupled with the capacity
and the healthiness, I would like to ask you to wait a couple of weeks and discuss it during
our Investor Day because that will be part of our discussion in order to show you what is
the situation.

(Operator Instructions) We will now take our next question from Niccolo Dalla-Palma of
Exane. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

FINAL

Q - Niccolo Dalla-Palma
Yes. Good afternoon. Hi. My first question is on risk of rating integration and impact on
solvency. I know it must be very difficult to get precise numbers but the fact that S&P had - did not downgrade Italy at this stage, did it avoid negative impact on requirements[ph]?
And how should we measure it from the outside? Again, I know it's difficult but just any
indication of how relevant it would have been would be helpful.
Secondly, on Generali Leben, could you update us on the process, of course, there's no
regulatory stand here, but maybe something you could say on how the approval is going.
And lastly, there was some news about an agreement between DWS and Generali on -for partnership on some products. Could you maybe explain this slightly better? There
was, I think, no specific full press release on this, so maybe you can add some comments
there? Thanks.

A - Cristiano Borean

{BIO 15246531 <GO>}

Hi, Niccolo, can you please re-elaborate the third question because it was not clear to us.
Sorry for asking again, but just to be sure that we can answer properly.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Niccolo Dalla-Palma
So for the third question, there was some news that DWS picked -- was picked by
Generali for a funds partnership but there were limited details of what the partnership
would look like. So just wondering what is -- what it actually is?

A - Cristiano Borean

{BIO 15246531 <GO>}

Okay, so starting on the first point, there is cooperating migration and sensitivity. I would
like to ask you to wait a little bit and let's discuss this at the Investor Day so that we will
have a clear and better view also on our asset allocation and the risk of our asset
allocation. Related to the second point, I would like to hand over to Frederic.

A - Frederic de Courtois

{BIO 16976110 <GO>}

On Generali Leben, the process is ongoing. My only comment is that the process is
ongoing as planned. So we are confident. I'd like also to remind you that the new IIM[ph]
regulation is now official, which has a positive impact on the -- that we had published in
our press release in the earn-out with the buyers. So this is for us an additional EUR125
million. On your third point on partnership, I have no specific comment. I mean, this is part
of our new asset management strategy. So we are doing these partnerships and we start
to see the positive impact in our result.

Q - Niccolo Dalla-Palma
Thanks very much.

Our next question comes from Nick Holmes of Societe General. Please go ahead. Your
line is open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Hi, there. Thanks. I just wanted to come back on unit-linked sales. Now that the markets
have fallen, do you think that the unit-linked growth story is over for the time being? And
also, could you give us a bit more color on the very strong growth in Protection that you're
seeing, sort of which countries and sort of which products? Thank you.

A - Cristiano Borean

{BIO 15246531 <GO>}

Hi, Nick. So first point on unit linked, I recall that there are different forms of unit linked.
You do not sell only equity -- equity linked, unit linked. There are even forms of unit linked
where we are selling which are so-called volatility protection unit linked. So -- this stronger
collection which we are observing in many countries, call it, (inaudible) strategy, should not
be impacted because of the different capacity of offer. And then related to the protection
part, I should say that the major evolution comes on one side from the European part and
then there is also a growth for protection in our Asian products in China. Here it is.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Sorry, the -- thank you. So basically, would you say that we should interpret your comments
that you're still confident that unit-linked growth will be an important driver in Life?

A - Cristiano Borean

{BIO 15246531 <GO>}

Yes, Nick, because unit linked are 35% of our new business premiums. So basically, we are
confirming the capacity of the collection in that side. Of course thereafter a quarter, also
Page 10 of 12



Company N ame: Assicuraz ioni Generali SpA

thanks to the differentiation in the offer we are building and the coverage of the different
needs, which is key also part of our investment offer strategy in this sense. So we do not
see any kind of drop, neither drop nor a potential risk, related to that at this point in the
figures.

Thanks a lot. Just one question on the asset management business. Obviously, the
strategy was put in place previously and there was obviously a strong focus on real assets
investing in the illiquid space. During Q3 we had the announcement of the Aperture
Investors instead of in the US, with more of a -- in terms of charging structure more than
ETF like structure. I'm just wondering whether you can give any color vis-a-vis plans to roll
that out in other core markets perhaps across Europe or Italy going forward? Thank you.
