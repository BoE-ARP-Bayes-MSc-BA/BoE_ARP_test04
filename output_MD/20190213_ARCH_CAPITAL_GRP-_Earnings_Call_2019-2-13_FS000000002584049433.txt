Mr. François Morin. Sirs, you may begin.

Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Thank you, Shannon, and good morning to you all. Once again, this quarter, strong
earnings from our mortgage segment offset the effects of catastrophe losses in our
property casualty segments as Arch produced an annualized operating return on equity of
8.8% and 10.7% for the 2018 fourth quarter and full year, respectively.

Bloomberg Transcript

Given the level of catastrophe losses across the globe in 2018, our results demonstrate
again the value of our core principles of diversification, sound risk selection, underwriting
discipline and cycle management. François will provide more commentary on our financial
results in a moment, but it's worth pausing for a minute to thank all employees at Arch
who are committed to meeting the needs of our clients while producing superior returns.
Given the notable catastrophe events for the past two years, we will begin our discussion
of market conditions with the January 1 renewal market in property cat reinsurance. As you
may have heard on other earnings calls this quarter, on average, property cat rate
increases at Jan. 1 were positive, but below expectations, given the record level of
insured cat losses that were reported in the past two years. Across the industry, lossaffected property accounts saw rate increases of 10% or more, while some property
accounts in Europe were flat to down 5%.
Hidden within the underlying property cat industry average rate changes, there are some
signs of tightening capacity within the retro and facultative markets. But in many case rate
levels, relative to risk remain inadequate to deploy additional capital from our perspective.
At Arch, we believe that we enhance our odds of doing better than the industry average
by allocating capital dynamically to areas with a better risk/reward trade-off and that
disciplined underwriting and risk selection will remain at the core of what makes us and
has made us successful.
There is reason to believe that some rate improvement may occur throughout the year as
the market absorbs the recent history of large cat losses. However, uncertainty with
respect to both the expected amount of capital and the return on capital within the
property cat market make it difficult to predict where cat rates will be by year-end 2019.
In the interest of time, I'm not going to review market conditions line by line as I'm sure
you have already heard about that on other calls this quarter, but I will instead address the
underwriting environment in general. In our P&C segments, in some of our insurance lines,

FINAL

rate increases appear to be outpacing claim trends. But, as we have discussed in prior
quarters, we continue to believe that the risk of claim inflation rising above its long-term
trend is high and we remain cautious in our allocation of capital and in setting our loss
picks.
The modest improvements in rates are concentrated primarily in the short-tail cat
exposed business, in the U.S. commercial auto and some areas of casualty. As always, we
focus on the absolute level of risk-adjusted returns, not just relative rate changes.
Turning now to our mortgage segment, the underwriting environment remains very
attractive with ongoing growth in our insurance in force producing strong increases in
earned premium and will contribute to a future stream of earnings that is both stable and
predictable. For the fourth quarter, our U.S. MI new insurance written or NIW were $16.7
billion, a 16% increase over the same quarter last year, and the proportion of single
premium business remained low at about 9% of NIW this quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

Within our U.S. primary business, the credit quality of loans insured remains excellent and
our key risk barometers are still at very healthy levels. To put this in historical context, our
risk indices tell us that the current borrowers' credit characteristics are still substantially
higher, in fact, by roughly a factor of 2 relative to the borrowers of the late 1990s and
early 2000s.
We have seen mortgages with greater than 95% loan-to-value grow slightly as a
percentage of our NIW to about 16% in the fourth quarter, while credit quality, as indicated
by FICO scores, remained high across our in-force book with a weighted average score of
743. As far as the new mortgage risk transfer programs with the GSEs, the so named
IMAGIN and EPMI facilities, we believe that these programs will continue to grow within our
expectations roughly at a modest 2% of total NIW for the market on an annualized basis.
Briefly, with respect to our investment operations, higher yields available in the financial
markets and growth in invested assets led to a 16% increase in net investment income in
the fourth quarter over the same period a year ago. We remain underweight credit and
interest rate reflecting our cautious outlook.
Moving to capital management, despite our exposure to property cat in 2018, we were
able to deploy some of our capital towards expanding our distribution capabilities,
deleveraging our debt and repurchasing our shares. As you know, we recently closed on
acquisitions in the U.S. and the UK that are expected to expand our distribution base.
Volatility in the equity markets also gave us opportunities to repurchase approximately
$100 million of our common shares in the quarters at attractive prices. As in all of our
capital allocation processes, we employ a rigorous and disciplined assessment of
available opportunities to deploy capital in order to generate long-term returns for our
shareholders across all phases of the cycle.
Turning now briefly to risk management, for the past few years and continuing into 2019,
our property cat exposures remain at historically low levels with our 1-in-250 year peak

FINAL

zone at about 4.5% of tangible common equity at January 1. We have the ability and the
capacity to deploy more capital to this sector if available returns improve to acceptable
levels this year.
For Arch clients and investors, our ability to increase our support in times of need is a
significant benefit to the marketplace and a source, we believe, of long-term value
creation for our shareholders. In our mortgage segment, our issuance of insurance-linked
notes known as Bellemeade securities have significantly reduced our shareholders'
exposure to the tail effects on our business from economic recessions and have paved
the way for a significant reduction into our risk profile despite growth in our insurance inforce.
With regards to PMIERs, as of December 2018, Arch MI's sufficiency ratio was 141% of the
GSE capital requirements known as PMIERs as I had mentioned. It also exceeds the
proposed GSE revisions under PMIERs 2.0, which is to be effective on March 31, 2019.
With that, I will turn it over to François. François?

François Morin

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Marc, and good morning to all. I'd like to give you some comments and
observations on our results for the fourth quarter. Consistent with prior practice, these
comments are on a core basis which corresponds to Arch's financial results, excluding the
other segment, i.e., the operations of Watford Re. In our filings, the term consolidated
includes Watford Re.
After-tax operating income for the quarter was $189.2 million, which translate to an
annualized 8.8% operating return on average common equity and $0.46 per share. For
the full year, our operating ROE stands at 10.7%, a solid result in light of the elevated
catastrophe activity in the second half of 2018 and a pricing environment in the P&C
sector that remains competitive. Book value per share was $21.52 at December 31, a 1.7%
increase from last quarter and a 6% increase from one year ago despite the impact of
higher interest rates on total returns for the quarter and the year.
Moving on to underwriting results, losses from 2018 catastrophic events in the fourth
quarter, net of reinsurance recoverables and reinstatement premiums, were $118.2 million
or a 9.7 combined ratio points. These losses were predominantly the result of Hurricane
Michael hitting the Florida Panhandle and the California wildfires, but we also felt the
impact of other minor events across the globe.
As for prior-period net losses or development, we recognized approximately $74.4 million
of favorable development in the fourth quarter net of related adjustments or 6.1
combined ratio points compared to 4.6 combined ratio points in the fourth quarter of
2017.
All segments were favorable, led by the reinsurance segment with approximately $33
million favorable, the mortgage segment also at $33 million favorable and the insurance
Page 4 of 24

FINAL

segment contributing $8 million. This level is consistent with the third quarter 2018 results
as we continue to benefit from significant favorable development in our first-lien portfolio
in the mortgage segment where cure rates this year continue to be materially higher than
long-term averages and expectations.
The insurance segment's accident quarter combined ratio, excluding cats, was 98.3%,
slightly lower than for the same period one year ago. Most of the improvement came
from lower levels of attritional losses and acquisition expenses.
The reinsurance segment accident quarter combined ratio, excluding cats, stood at 96.2%
compared to 103.2% on the same basis one year ago. As we mentioned on prior calls, we
tend to look at trailing 12-month analyses in order to assess the ongoing performance of
our segments, given the inherent volatility in the business that can emerge from quarter
to quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

The year-over-year comparison for the reinsurance segment is affected by a few notable
items. First, as we mentioned on the previous call, our acquisition expense ratio last year
reflected the federal excise taxes associated with a large internal loss portfolio transfer.
Second, our loss experienced this quarter was impacted by a large attritional casualty loss
arising from the California wildfires. And third, we had a noticeable amount of
reinstatement premiums and premium adjustments this quarter that benefited our
combined ratio. Once we adjust for these variations, the underlying performance of our
reinsurance segment remained strong this quarter.
The mortgage segment's accident quarter combined ratio improved by 1,410 basis points
from the fourth quarter of last year as a result of the continued strong underlying
performance of the book, particularly within our U.S. primary MI operations. The calendar
quarter loss ratio of 2.1% in the fourth quarter of 2018 compares favorably to the 17.8% in
the same quarter of 2017 due to substantially lower delinquency rates. Part of the
difference is attributable to increased favorable prior development, which was
approximately 320 basis points higher than last year.
In addition, there was approximately $13 million or 410 basis points of favorable
development on 2018 delinquencies due to very strong cure activity in the period. The
expense ratio was 20.5%, lower by 160 basis points than in the same period one year ago
as a result of expense savings achieved.
I'd like to remind everyone that due to the nuances of purchase accounting, the
amortization of our debt asset should continue to increase in 2019 by an amount that is
approximately $8 million higher on an annual basis than 2018 levels, increasing acquisition
expenses. These results highlight the contribution to our pre-tax underwriting income
from the mortgage segment, which remained strong this quarter.
After allocating corporate items such as investment income, interest expense and income
taxes to each segment, the mortgage segment's contribution to our 2018 net income
decreases to approximately 75% of the total after normalizing our results for catastrophic
activity.

FINAL

Total investment returns for the quarter was a positive 51 basis points on a U.S. dollar
basis and a positive 83 basis points on a local currency basis. These returns highlight the
defensive high-quality position of our fixed income portfolio and solid result in our
alternatives portfolio in light of a volatile quarter across global financial markets.
During the quarter, we continued to move away from municipal bonds and into corporate
and government bonds due to relative valuations. The repositioning of our portfolio
during 2018 combined with the reinvestment of shorter maturity bonds and other swap
activity at higher yields generated higher investment income year-over-year.
We extended the duration of our investment portfolio in the quarter to 3.38 years, up
from 2.94 years on a sequential basis as global economies weakened. Operating cash
flow on a core basis was a strong $384 million in the quarter, reflecting the solid
performance of our units.
The corporate effective tax rate in the quarter on pre-tax operating income was 16.8%
and reflects the benefit of the lower U.S. tax rate, the geographic mix of our pre-tax
income and a 210-basis-point expense from discrete tax items in the quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

As a result, the effective tax rate on pre-tax operating income, excluding discrete items,
was 14.7% this quarter, higher than the 9.9% rate last quarter. The difference from this rate
to the numbers noted in our recent pre-release is primarily attributable to discrete items
and a higher level of U.S.-based income, which triggered a true-up of tax accruals for the
first three quarters of the year.
As we look ahead to 2019, we currently believe it's reasonable to expect that the
effective tax rate on operating income will be in the range of 11% to 14%. As always, the
effective tax rate could vary depending on the level and location of income or loss and
varying tax rates in each jurisdiction.
With respect to capital management, we paid down the remaining $125 million of our
revolving credit facility during the quarter and we also repurchased 3.6 million shares at an
average price of $27.11 per share and an aggregate cost of $98.2 million under our Rule
10b5 plan that we implemented during this quarter's closed window period.
Our remaining authorization, which expires in December 2019, stood at $164 million at
December 31, 2018. Our debt to total capital ratio stood at 15.5% at year-end and debt
plus preferred to total capital ratio was 22.5%, down 390 basis points from year-end 2017
and a full 620 basis points from year-end 2016 when we closed the UGC acquisition.
Finally, I would like to bring to your attention a change we are introducing in 2019
regarding our incentive compensation practices. As you know, equity grants made to
employees had historically been awarded in May of each year. Starting this year, equity
grants are expected to be awarded in the first quarter, subject to board approval. As a
result, we would expect a small distortion in the timing of our operating expenses. The
impact of this change based on 2018 equity grants is an expected shift of approximately

Page 6 of 24



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2019-02-13

$11 million to $13 million in operating expenses from the second quarter to the first quarter
of 2019.

FINAL

Two-thirds of that expense is expected to be reflected within our operating segments
with the remainder in corporate expenses and investment expenses.
With these introductory comments, we are now prepared to take your questions.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. Our first question comes from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning. The MI segments continued to show very strong results. Is the
16%, the underlying loss ratio, a good run rate going forward or you see continuing
improvements from there?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

The loss ratio has been very good and actually better than we had anticipated probably a
year, year and a half ago. So, we have ongoing improvement in notice of the falls in curing
rate. So, right now, everything we're pointing to is much less than the long-term average,
which would be 20% I would think overall cycle. So, yes, you could pick your number, Kai.
It's very hard to predict the future, but certainly we are in a very benign loss environment.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

That's great. But if you take out I mean the large amount of reserve leases, the reported
loss ratio is below 10%, have been around 10% for the last several years. At what point the
regulator would just say, hey, the result is too good and will (00:19:53) be more focused
on either pricing or competition could start to come in?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Well, I think I'm not sure what the regulators would do, but from our perspective, this is
still a risky insurance product like everything else that's out there and what matters is
really about the return. And I would argue that even if you have a little bit higher-thanaverage return in the current environment, that probably more than makes up for some of
the bad years that have occurred in the industry.
So, we're not losing sleep over this. There's no commentary to the effect that the loss
ratio is too high or too low. In fact, I would even argue that the new capital framework
from the GSEs are leading us in a direction of still appropriate level of capital and return in
the industry to make sure it's a solid framework for housing finance.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

FINAL

That's great. Hopefully the industry have a long (20:48) memory. So, on the reinsurance
side, the top line growth is very strong even without the reinstatement premiums for the
quarter. Could you talk a bit about where do you see growth opportunity and what kind of
return are you getting from those businesses? Are they higher than your existing
business?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yeah. So, the growth year-on-year is a little bit distorted. If you look at the last four
quarters, it's more consistent. The growth that we've seen over the last 12 months
continues to be areas that we've talked about before, international motor quota share,
actually some commercial auto, we have some opportunities in there, and some workers'
comp opportunities of all things and some property-specific – property cat-related
exposure in the reinsurance group as well.
So, the growth that we're seeing in reinsurance is consistent with our fishing and looking
around in the world for good returns, better risk-adjusted return if we can, and away
(00:21:45) from probably the more traditional commoditized reinsurance business. So, it's
a little bit more bespoke than the rest of the things you would hear about the
marketplace.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. Last one if I may on California, you had losses both from the property side as well
as the liability side. So, how do you think of the market going forward in term of pricing, in
term of like any – sort of like your risk appetite in the market on both the property side as
well as the liability side for the utilities?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yes. So, on the liability side, it's a little bit easier to answer, because these things almost –
there's a lot of question mark in the industry as to whether these are insurable and at
what level and at what price. And as you know, it's not a big market. And currently the
player that's been tagged or have been identified as being liable for that loss is going
through a lot of difficult times. So, we'll see how that develops. So it's currently developing
as we speak.
This is still a very small market right in a broader scheme of things. As far as the property
is concerned, it's really uncertain. As I said in my opening remarks, the capital supply is still
plentiful. There were talks at the beginning, Kai. Maybe that's what you allude to, to the
fact that there might be some changes to the modeling of California wildfires, but it's still
very early. People are still trying to figure out what they have and what it means in their
modeling.
And as you know, it's a more – it's a little bit isolated, in fact, right. It's isolated to one area
of the country and people have a way to manage a portfolio and deploy capital in other
areas. So, it's a very hard question to answer, because we don't know what the supply of

Page 8 of 24

capital is going to be by mid-year, but logic would dictate it should go up to some extent,
but we'll see what happens.

Q - Geoffrey Murray Dunn

Thanks. Good morning.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hey, Geoff.

Q - Geoffrey Murray Dunn

{BIO 3447798 <GO>}

I was hoping you could comment a little on the ILN market. Now that just about all the MIs
are using that market and indicating that they plan to use it on a recurring basis, are you
seeing any change in terms, conditions, appetite or is it as steady as it was over the last
few years?

A - François Morin
No. What we've seen – there's actually no indication that it's weakening. We see
tremendous investor appetite for the product. As you know, the GCs (00:24:13) really
started and we were in there as well as the sole MI that was accessing that market. In the
last year, most of the others have jumped into, I call it, on the bandwagon and it just
makes it for – I mean investors now have the ability – when they do their research, they do
the analysis, they feel it's something that's repeatable. They can access that type of
product not only through us, but also through some of our competitors.
So, as far as we can tell, there's still tremendous appetite for the product. It's expanding a
little bit, getting some of our instruments rated. There's also help, but we see that as
something that we – there's nothing on the horizon that suggests that we won't be able
to execute on it.

And to add to this, Geoff, I would also argue that the spreads are not widening. At least,
we don't see any indication of spreads widening. So, this appears to be a stability of
pricing expectations in the product as well.

A - François Morin

FINAL

Yeah. Recognizing...

There's some volatility here and there, but in the long term, we think, yes.

Spreads have been very stable.

A - François Morin
Yeah.

Q - Geoffrey Murray Dunn

{BIO 3447798 <GO>}

It looks like you took another dividend this quarter. Should we take that to assume that the
regulators are also comfortable with this market and view it as true capital relief ?

A - François Morin
Absolutely.

Q - Geoffrey Murray Dunn

{BIO 3447798 <GO>}

Okay.

A - François Morin
I mean, we argue it's even better than traditional reinsurance, because we have the cash
on hand. So, it's collateralized on – and from that point of view, they agree with it, they
accept it and they should have been happier than just other forms of capital. I mean, aside
from just additional equity.

Q - Geoffrey Murray Dunn

{BIO 3447798 <GO>}

Okay. And then, a follow-up on new notice development. Is the company's book reaching
an inflection point where even though the newer vintages are of very high quality and
outperforming, but the book size is obviously and the ceasing is going to drive decent
new notice levels? Are the more recent vintages now exceeding the benefit of the runoff
of the 2008, meaning that we should see on average new notice growth going forward?

I think we will at some point. I'm not sure that we've crossed it yet. It's very hard for us to
see and to predict that, but you're right, over time, we would expect as the 2009 in prior
– or the 2008 in prior is rolling off. Yeah, we would expect that. And I'm not sure that we
are there yet.

Our next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning, everybody.

A - François Morin
Good morning.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Good morning.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

So, I was noticing the trend and it was not so surprising that the proportion of new policies
being run on the mortgage segment that are coming from refis gets smaller and smaller
all the time, now down to 5%. Is there any difference ultimately you think in the quality of a
refi-ed mortgage versus a new mortgage. I guess you know the refi-ed mortgage is
better, at least the market knows them better. How should we think about that?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yeah. Clearly, there tends to be at the margins better quality for the refinance market, but
it's clearly not a target market for the MI market, right? So broadly, you are right. But in
terms of what pertains to be MI market, our penetration for origination of MI – of
mortgages in refinance is 5% or 6%. So, it's very, very small. The market that we are
targeting that is really our bread and butter, if you will, is the purchase market and that's
still pretty healthy and that's really what we've been focusing on.

Page 11 of 24



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2019-02-13

So, having said all of this, if you look at historically at the blend of the cycle, the blend of
the DTI, it's been fairly consistent and I think that speaks to – there's not that much of a
difference between the credit requirement whether you refinance or whether you
purchase.

FINAL

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

And not to belabor too much on the refi, but typically if you are writing the MI on a refi-ed
mortgage, are you the MI on the mortgage it's replacing?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Not necessarily, because you could be refinancing with the different financial institutions
and at the end, that institution may have a different agreement with a different MI. Not
necessarily.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Okay. And switching gears, on the wildfire liability, look, obviously that was a difficult loss
two years in a row, but the pricing might have been adequate to take that. A lot of times
though in certain markets, the market really isn't big enough to give you a payback, no
matter how good the pricing is. Do you think you'll get a chance to write wildfire liability
this year and is the market sizable and attractive enough to make it a worthwhile business
to write on a multi-year basis?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yeah. The answer is yes to all of those. I think, in general, we don't think of either being in
the market or not based on size. I think what it means to us is we would put in relation to
the market size our commitment to that marketplace and you have to – the interesting in
re-insurance, Josh, is you have to forget last year and look forward, because if you look
back to what the losses you had, you don't have to make the money the way you lost it.
That's clearly one thing that we always live by every day, but certainly, every time a
proposition comes to us, provided we have the right information and the right
perspective on the loss, if it's a profitable thing, we would do it regardless of the size of
the market. The only thing that we would do is right-size our commitment to that specific
market based on its size relative to the broad capital base of the company.

Good morning.

Bloomberg Transcript

First up, François, in the prepared remarks, you made comments about actions you take
on the expense side to improve the ratio and the trend has been improvement over the
last year or so. This quarter came in, I think, better than expected. Any one-time items in
there or is that improvement somewhat sustainable?

A - François Morin
Well, are you referring specifically to mortgage?

Q - Michael Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Yeah. Yeah.

A - François Morin
Yeah, well, mortgage, right, we acknowledge internally that it's been two years since the
acquisition and we're basically complete with the integration. And we told – hopefully you
guys will remember that we told you it'd be a journey, would take a couple of years to
fully integrate the two operations and we're at this stage now when you compare
obviously year-over-year Q4 2017 to Q4 2018 where we just realized more savings in
technology and people, et cetera.
So, I think we're kind of there. There's also a bit of seasonality that comes into play, but
we're truly in a good spot in terms of where we think our expense base and especially
operating expenses will be going forward.

Okay. Got it. And sticking with the mortgage segment, Marc, you made a – interesting stat
you made in the prepared remarks about mortgage credit quality being approximately – I
think you said two times better than crisis levels. Maybe you can further elaborate on
what's behind that viewpoint?

FINAL

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

We have internal proprietary credit analysis evaluation and you could also look at some
things that are published by outfits such as the Urban Institute and you will look at the
relatively credit quality based on an index looking at late 1990s, early 2000s, factoring
income, credit score and all these various aspects of a creditworthiness of a borrower.
And when you run it through the grinder, if you will, and you come up with a number at the
end, that number is half of what it was back in the late 1990s and 2000s. So, this may, on
a comparable basis, long stand to be as apples-to-apples as can be.

Q - Michael Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Okay. It's interesting because yeah, we know qualitatively there's a lot of reasons why
credit quality is most likely better. So, it's interesting that you're trying to quantify it, that's
helpful.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yeah. Very, very much so. Yeah.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Michael Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

And so, I'll just follow-up on that and maybe I'm missing this on the supplement. I can get
it offline, but at what percentage of the mortgage insurance portfolio has reinsurance
protection and what's the average duration of that reinsurance protection?

A - François Morin
That's a good question. I mean I don't have the numbers right in front of me, but it's...

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

There are a couple things. So at 50% quota share with AIG...

A - François Morin
20 years.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

2014 through 2016. Then, you have Bellemeade. We have about $1.1 billion of outstanding
limits on the Bellemeade that covers...

About two-thirds.

Q - Michael Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Okay. And the duration of the Bellemeade transactions roughly?

A - François Morin
Well, they're 10-year transactions, right. So they're all a bit different. Some have features
where we tried to have the coverage be in-force for a bit longer, but I would say about
five years is probably something where we – that we – and as we keep rolling off or
adding new ones, so I think that should remain pretty stable as we move forward.

Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi. Yes. My first question, so you guys said if you normalize for cats, that your see
(00:34:13) mortgage, I think you said about 75% of earnings, I guess. What do you guys
view as your normal cat load, since your PMLs have come down, right, but we're coming
off of two years of pretty high cat losses?

A - François Morin
Well, the cat load roughly is about $30 million a quarter, $30 million to $35 million a
quarter, that's kind of where we've been, what we've been running at the last couple of
years and these numbers that I quoted, really all we do is replace, effectively, the actual
cats with the expected or the cat loads. So, hopefully that answers your question.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Page 15 of 24



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2019-02-13

Okay. And then, so when you give us the tax rate guidance for the coming year, you're
also assuming that cats fall within that normal level, correct?

A - François Morin

FINAL

Correct. Yes. That's fully a full-year forecast with an expected cat year, which as you know
is usually not the case. It's either lower or high, but yes.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. And then, on reinsurance, you guys seemed to kind of be cautious and balanced in
terms of what might happen at the mid-year renewals. Marc, how much would you say you
need rates to go up for Arch to want to materially write more cat business, if you want to
talk separately about what you might want to see at April 1 versus, 06/01 and 07/01 in
Florida?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I guess I could tell you a lot more, but that's not going to get you what you want. So I think
if you look back, Elyse, at one of my comments about six quarters ago, looking back at the
characteristics, at the time, the numbers were 35% to 40% to really start getting us to the
risk-adjusted return that we believe is appropriate. We've had since maybe 10% to 12%
rate increase. So, that tells you we're probably 25% to 30% still short of rate change to
really get there.
And again, I want to caution everyone that is listening to this saying that that 20%, 25% is
not going to come across the board all at once. There are some pockets that need a bit
more than this, some that need a little bit less than this, but that gives you a flavor for how
much more we believe we need to get us to start going the path of deploying more
capital.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And then, on the mortgage side, as some of your
competitors have adopted risk-based pricing models as well, have you started to observe
a broader impact on the market, kind of anything changing there?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Nothing yet. It's still very, very early. So we'll have to wait and see how it is rolled out, how
it's actually developing in the marketplace. And I would say that for everybody's benefit
that our risk-based pricing was created back in 2011. This is our UG (00:37:00) – well now,
Arch U.S. MI operation and there's a lot of things that need to happen to have a run rate.
So, we're going to have most likely some bumps along the way. Our competitors are
going to be trying things and figuring out things that work and don't work out as well. So
we're bracing for it, but the key thing from our perspective is we're keeping steady in our
grid and our risk-based pricing. And we're going to take whatever market – however they
react, we'll be the beneficiary or we'll lose some business because it's mispriced based
on our own. But, it's too early to tell, Elyse. It's going to take a while.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Great. And then, there's some concerns on the outside in terms of recession and
impact on credit and how that might play out late this year, maybe into 2020. As you guys
obviously alluded to credit being really strong relative to past cycles, but what would you
be paying attention to, to see the potential turn in the credit cycle?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Right now, I think if you look historically at what went wrong, it really did not – I mean
certainly the credit quality, the credit worthiness of the borrower is extremely important,
right. But what happened historically that really created the issue is a product
development. If the product (00:38:20) like the low doc, no doc, Alt-A, all this stuff comes
back to the market, this is what we'd be worried about.

Bloomberg Transcript

Of course, the other macro thing that could impact everything is a housing price
depreciation across the economy. But one thing that we're not worried about – the reason
why we're not so worried about right now is because there is a shortfall on housing supply
and it's been there for quite a while. So everybody is predicting a smaller price increase
in-house prices, but still positive for the next two, three years. So, a recession could
probably put a bump on this. So, if you look at it historically in some recessions in the past,
we had times when house price increased by 1%.
The only time it went down, guys, for your benefit and that's actually very useful to know,
is only in 2007/2008 crisis. For the last 45 years, it never – the house price index, despite
having gone through five, I think, different recessions, only came down once, the price
index came down once.
So, that the product is really the problem, Elyse, and we don't see anything yet.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Thank you. Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. Your line is open.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Great, thanks. Marc, in your introductory comments, you noted not just that loss trends
could get worse, but they could resume sort of above-average levels. And I was hoping
you could sort of clarify why that is a concern right now?

A - Marc Grandisson

FINAL

Because we're seeing some changes in some of our submissions and some of our data,
it's still very early signs. And it's really anecdotal, sometimes anecdotal, sometimes
actually real. So, we're seeing price, seeing loss trend picking up in certain areas.
And we believe, it's only a matter of time before we start spreading to other lines of
business. And in my eyes, we're students as well as of the industry and the CPI is about
1.8, 1.7. As I mentioned that in prior calls, the inflation on – the insurance inflation is typically
running ahead of it by 150 to 250.
So, I would expect the trend that could be recapturing, having a very vibrant economy,
exposure growth and more friction in the marketplace. We would expect those to
generate more losses. And the reason we're putting that out, Meyer, is because I want to
put that into perspective of the price increase that we're talking about on average, being
200 bps to 250 bps or 300 bps, it's just doesn't make for a lot of margin of safety as you
go about it analyzing how you allocate capital between lines of business.
And as you know, more probably than I do is when you write a business, an insurance
policy, it takes years for you to really find out how bad or how good it's going to be. So we
tend to take a more cautious approach to it.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. That's very helpful. And thank you. A quick modeling question, with the recent U.S.
and UK acquisitions, are those going to produce any appreciable change in the expense
ratio?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Short term.

A - François Morin
Well, both acquisitions were the insurance (41:27) segments. So I would say that the
expense ratio, yes, no question that in one of our acquisitions, the UK, maybe a bit of
integration expenses that we'll have – that will be reflected. But all in all, given that the U.S.
one was something that we – it's a partner, or it's a business that we've done business
with for many, many years, that should not really impact the expense ratio.
And the final thing, which you'll see in the 10-K that will certainly trigger a bit slightly higher
intangible amortization expenses that start coming through in 2019.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. And that's segment or corporate?

A - François Morin
Well, the intangibles is all one number, all together. So when we finish up our analysis and
we publish a 10-K in a couple of weeks, you'll see the slight changes in – from what we

Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is open.

Q - Seth Rosenberg

{BIO 21233136 <GO>}

Hey, guys. Seth Rosenberg here for Brian. Thanks for taking my questions. I got one for
you. So if you look at the insurance segment, large losses improved versus last year. But if
you look back at last year, I think, you had called out 2.2 points, which was elevated at the
time.

Bloomberg Transcript

So if you just take this quarter in a vacuum and not the comparison, would you say that
large losses were better or worse, in line with expectations? And I ask because so many
companies are calling out a higher frequency and severity of large losses. So just trying to
get a feel if there's something in loss cost there that concerns you.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Right. So our insurance group has some lumpiness to it, right, not as much as reinsurance,
for obvious reasons. But there's still some quarters that are above average or below
average. This quarter was sort of an average quarter for us in terms of a large risk loss or
non-attrition loss as they call it. We have a hard time for everybody's benefit, slicing and
dicing and the losses in so many different sections. At the end of the day, we are
providing insurance coverage for all kinds of losses. So what you're seeing right now is
sort of what is our loss being inclusive (43:31) of all the things that could happen in our
portfolio.

Q - Seth Rosenberg

{BIO 21233136 <GO>}

Got it. So nothing particular to construction costs or labor that really stuck out and drove
severity?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

No. If anything would have happened there, it would be already factored in our loss ratio
pick.

Q - Seth Rosenberg

{BIO 21233136 <GO>}

FINAL

Q - Seth Rosenberg

{BIO 21233136 <GO>}

And then, switching over to a mortgage, last year the delinquency rate spiked up due to
the storms in the third quarter. No reason to believe that we would see a similar dynamic
in the first quarter from Michael and the wildfires?

A - François Morin
No. We looked at this and we also thought about the government shutdown, which was
on the horizon. But there's certainly GSE rulings that prevent us from these potential
delinquencies developing into claims.
And going back to the hurricane, 2017 was slightly different in the sense that both – in
particular Harvey where the flooding was persisted for a number of weeks. It was more
damaging than Michael that came in and through and didn't really have an elongated
timeframe to the event. So at this time, we don't think there will be any spike in our
delinquency from the cats.

A - Marc Grandisson

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Thanks and good morning. Just two quick follow-ups, if I may. The first question goes back
to the discussion on wildfire casualty losses. I just wanted to understand a bit better. If the
Page 20 of 24



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity

utilities numbers change, or if there's any other development, does your current number
remain static? Or how is that reserve? Maybe just help me, just explain that a bit more.

FINAL

A - François Morin
Well, from our point of view, it was a – it's fully reserved. So there's no adverse
development that we can see on this on this particular claim. Yes, it might with bankruptcy
court and things could change. But if they change, we think they'll be in our favor, they will
reduce the number. But we've taken the most conservative view that we can think of at
this point. And we'll see how things play out.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

And what is the size of this book for you in terms of percentages or any way to sort of
think about it?

A - François Morin

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, it's really a one-off, right? It's not a book per se. We have a small unit that focuses on
these kind of bespoke transactions. Typically, there is a lot of them that are property-type
deals. This one is a casualty deal as well. And, as you know, these deals come to the
market infrequently that you don't know where they're coming. You look at the
opportunity, you assess the risk, you make a decision on the pricing. And if the riskadjusted returns are there, we try to participate. So at this point, it's really not – it's not
really a book in itself. It's an amalgamation of policies that we write on an ad-hoc basis.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

And, Amit, one thing that's interesting we just want you to know because it's such in a
high press to get out of press, you don't hear about the 98 others that are actually – that
worked out to our favor. But let's leave it at that.

A - François Morin
Yeah.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

That's a very fair point. Yeah. I guess, the only other question I had was going back to the
discussion on buyback and I think in opening remarks, you talked about the volatility in the
markets giving you an opportunity. The buyback obviously was higher than my numbers
and the Street numbers. In the past, we used to talk about a matrix and so there used to
be a matrix on your website, which I was having trouble finding, are we still utilizing that
payback matrix or how should we think about the future buybacks?

A - François Morin
Well, yes, the matrix that you're referring to is still the starting point of our analysis.

Q - Amit Kumar

Page 21 of 24



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2019-02-13

Yes.

A - François Morin

FINAL

And the question that comes up often from many of you on the phone is with the growth
in the mortgage segment, does that matrix or that view change?

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Yes, sir.

A - François Morin
And the answer is it does, but it's not black and white. What we like, and we told everyone
before about the mortgage segment is that we like the visibility and the predictability of
the earnings stream that it gives us. So the three-year payback that we've targeted in the
past, we have a view that, yes, maybe we'd be willing to extend it to four years, to five
years, who knows? But that's always considering all the options that are available to us.
We talk about acquisitions. We talk about reducing our leverage, so there is all these
aspects of capital management that come into play and yet – I mean, so hopefully that
answers your questions. So the grid is still there, but we have some flexibility around it.

Q - Amit Kumar

for wildfires and Michael, but predominantly with a few small others as well.

FINAL

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Okay. And maybe one follow-up then. As you look at the market into 2019, would you
expect opportunistically to growth of your property cat book or the – and the property cat
exposure?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Like I said, if we get the rates that we think are warranting an increase, we will increase.
And we have increased some property exposure in the last quarter. So there were some
opportunities to do it. As we said, it's just not a broad-based market opportunity, but we
are always in lookout for specific transactions or relationships to really take advantage of
that. So we have a – we're present on Front Street, we're open for business as you know
