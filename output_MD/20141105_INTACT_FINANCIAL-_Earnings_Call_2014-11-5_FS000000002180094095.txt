FINAL

Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

All right, thanks, Dennis. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking the time to
join us on the call. Earlier today, we announced strong results for the third quarter. For
me, the results illustrate the underlying strength of our operations. We've spoken before,
probably more times than we would've liked, about elevated cat losses impacting our
earnings.
This quarter was in some ways more of the same, but the net result was much improved as
our actions are paying oﬀ. We announced a $125 million impact from catastrophes, but
still reported net operating earnings of $185 million or $1.37 per share, more than three
times the level from a year ago. The Q3 earnings helped generate our 14.3% operating
ROE and 10% growth in book value per share over the past 12 months. So where does this
put us in relation to our two primary ﬁnancial objectives?

Bloomberg Transcript

On a year-to-date basis, our net operating income per share is up obviously signiﬁcantly
versus 2013 given the elevated level of cat losses last year. Though if we look back three
years, our ﬁrst nine months net operating income per share represents an average yearly
growth of close to 12% compared to our target of 10%.
From an ROE perspective, we target to outperform the industry by at least 500 basis
points every year. We've done so by 710 basis points on average in the past three years.
Based on the most recent industry data at June, we outperformed by 850 basis points so
far this year.
The earnings contribution in Q3 was broad-based in nature. Personal property is showing
its resilience with a combined ratio of 97.7% despite almost 17 points of cats. Year-to-date,
this line generated a combined ratio of 94.4%, better than our 95% target.
Our underlying results have shown great progress, in my view, but only half of our 10
point improvement plan yet to be earned. Similarly, while personal auto was heavily
impacted by storms in Alberta, its 95.8% combined ratio reﬂected an improvement in
underlying results.
Commercial P&C rebounded from a string of diﬃcult quarters with one of its best ever
performances, an 84.7% combined ratio. Across all lines of business, our 93.2% combined
ratio was close to 10 points better than a year ago. I think it's fair to say that the primary
reason our results came in above expectations was due to the strong results in
commercial P&C.

FINAL

So the obvious question is how much of this improvement is actually sustainable. Clearly,
you'll have quarters that are better than expected and others that are worse than
expected. I'd say that several items lined up favorably in the quarter in this line of
business. The year-to-date performance at 96.7% is how I think about this business, and
this is just not good enough. As such, our actions to improve the commercial lines
portfolio will continue.
In Ontario, the government's auto insurance cost and rate reduction strategy has so far
led to a reduction in ﬁled rates of 6% across the market as a whole. Our process of
reducing rates by 5.3% on average began in early April and has been focused on existing
customers. We're encouraged that Ontario Bill 15 is progressing well through the
Legislative Assembly. This is consistent with our view that the government is very
proactive on this ﬁle.
That being said, additional meaningful cost reduction measures are necessary for the
industry to achieve the government's 15% rate reduction target. I think they get that. And
in the current environment, due to the cost reduction measures already implemented and
our own actions, we are comfortable with our margins in this market and we'll continue to
pursue growth opportunities.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to the top line, certain pressure points have dissipated in recent weeks. First,
we've now completed our program to reduce the company's exposure to a large B.C.
earthquake. We have in the past 18 months eﬀectively reduced our exposure by 25%. This
exercise obviously weighted on growth in past quarters.
Secondly, we've talked about being an early mover with our 10-point improvement
initiative in property. The industry is clearly moving as market conditions have continued
to ﬁrm and our relative position has improved. Units were down about 1.5 points in the
quarter despite now reﬂecting our full product changes and rate actions.
Looking ahead for IFC, we expect our underlying growth to start improving from the 1.3%
pace of Q3. When it comes to our outlook for the industry, we foresee low-single-digit
growth in personal auto while we expect upper single digits in personal property from
continued hard market conditions.
Commercial P&C has ﬁrmed in the past year. Rate increases at renewal in this segment
were up by close to 5% in the third quarter. The low interest rate environment and
elevated losses from catastrophes should support our growth outlook.
So, before turning the call over to Louis, let me close on where growth will come from in
the coming 24 months to 36 months. In short, the message has not changed. At the end
of September, our ﬁnancial position was strong with close to $0.5 billion of excess capital.
Our objective is to leverage our outperformance by reinvesting our capital to expand our
leadership here in Canada. Organically, I expect growth to improve for two reasons. One,
the industry outlook is conducive to improvement given our leadership in implementing

FINAL

corrective measures. And two, our multi-channel distribution strategy is gaining
momentum.
When it comes to expanding our franchise, we continue to view meaningful acquisition
opportunities here in Canada in both manufacturing as well as in distribution. At the same
time, we're continuing to pursue our strategy to expand beyond Canada in a prudent
manner with the objective of building an organic pipeline with meaningful impact past 36
months. So I'm conﬁdent we have the right people and ﬁnancial resources to make this
plan a reality.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Louis Marcotte.

Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Thanks, Charles. Good morning, everyone. I will cover three topics this morning. First, a
brief discussion of the overall results, followed by more details on our lines of business
and, ﬁnally, I will comment on the strength of our balance sheet.

Bloomberg Transcript

As Charles mentioned earlier, our third quarter results were driven by our strong
underwriting performance, which generated a 93.2% combined ratio, including 7 points
of catastrophe losses. The vast majority of these losses were incurred by the time our
press release of August 27 was issued and we were fortunate not to suﬀer any substantial
weather events thereafter.
Our Q3 results also include improved underlying claims ratios, as well as a healthy level of
favorable prior year development, albeit less than last year. Clearly, this quarter's results
compare favorably to last year when we were hit by the Toronto rainstorm, the LacMégantic tragedy and multiple other cat losses.
Let me now take you through our results in detail starting with our lines of business.
Personal property was hit especially hard by this quarter's cats, close to 17 combined ratio
points in total, mostly from the hailstorm that hit the city of Airdrie, Alberta, in August.
In terms of underlying results, excluding cats and prior year development, we saw a 5point improvement year-over-year. Although we beneﬁted from relatively good weather
beyond the cats, the actions we've taken in this line of business over the past few quarters
are clearly bearing fruit.
With a year-to-date combined ratio of 94.4%, including 11 points of cats, we remain
committed to operating our property business at or below 95% combined ratio, cats
included. On the growth side, the continued severe weather has been supportive of hard
market conditions. Despite our rate and product changes, retention to date was better
than expected helping drive Q3 underlying growth to 5% in this line of business.
The Alberta hailstorm also led to elevated cat losses in personal auto resulting in a
combined ratio of 95.8%, almost 3 points worse than a year ago. Favorable prior year

claims development was weaker than last year but remains within our expectations. Our
underlying results were negatively impacted by the risk-sharing pools, whose results tend
to ﬂuctuate on a quarterly basis. Excluding this impact, underlying results in auto are
about 1 point better than last year.

FINAL

From a top line point of view, the personal auto business remains under pressure from
government-mandated rate reductions in Ontario.
Moving to commercial lines, our P&C business generated strong results as several drivers
of the business impacted it positively this quarter. The underlying current year loss ratio
was low at 53.4%, a nice change from recent quarters. While we are pleased with the mid80s combined ratio in Q3, we will continue our current plan to ensure a low-90s
performance is achieved on a sustainable basis.
Premiums in commercial P&C grew 3% in the quarter despite our actions to reduce
earthquake exposure and to improve proﬁtability in speciﬁc segments of our portfolio.
The commercial auto line of business continues to deliver solid underwriting results with a
combined ratio of 89.4%.

Bloomberg Transcript

A small amount of unfavorable prior year development was recorded in the quarter, but
this is not indicative of any underlying problems or new trends. Premiums were up 3%
from a year ago despite competitive market conditions.
Before moving to our balance sheet, I'd like to comment on three other areas of our
results. Our expense ratio of 29.6% was nearly 2 points better than Q3 2013 on lower
commissions and lower general expenses. The net investment income of $106 million in
the third quarter of 2014 was up 2% from a year ago as higher investments more than
oﬀset the decline in yields.
Net investment income is not expected to grow from the current quarterly level in 2015 as
the low yield environment should oﬀset the growth in our investments. Our distribution
business continues to grow at a good pace. So far this year, we recorded income from
distribution of $61 million, up 9% from 2013. Keep in mind the distribution business tends
to be seasonal.
Finally, allow me to comment on our ﬁnancial strength. We maintained our strong
ﬁnancial position at quarter-end with an estimated MCT of 203%, $497 million in excess
capital and debt-to-capital ratio of 17.8%. Three items explain most of the reduction in
excess capital from Q2. Firstly, a higher level of invested assets, assets led to a higher
capital charge; the stock market drop in September reduced our unrealized gains; and
the lower discount rate negatively impacted our pension plans.
Book value per share was $36.44 at the end of September, up only slightly versus Q2 as
the unrealized gains in pension plans negatively impacted our book value.

Date: 2014-11-05

On the investment side, our asset mix remains fairly stable. We now have 11% of our ﬁxed
income portfolio and 9% of our common share portfolio comprised of U.S. securities,
both of which provide geographic and sector diversiﬁcation.

FINAL

In closing, I believe our strong proﬁtability, our ﬁnancial strength and our people enhance
our ability to pursue growth prospects whether in manufacturing, distribution in Canada
or abroad.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Dennis.

Dennis Westfall

{BIO 15155973 <GO>}

Thanks, Louis. Lisa, we are now ready to take questions.

Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instruction] And our ﬁrst question comes from John Aiken from Barclays. Your
line is open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - John C. Aiken

{BIO 21267604 <GO>}

Good morning. Hi. When we look at the property lines, both personal and commercial,
you talk about all of the pricing impact and the claims mitigation strategies that you have
in place. On personal property, you're talking about half being baked in, so looking for
another 5 points improvement. But when do we expect this to get fully baked into the
results with obviously taking into consideration the ongoing volatility?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I'll let Patrick Barbeau take care of the impact of home insurance, which indeed have run
its course to a greater extent than in commercial lines, where we've had good actions in
the past year, but there's still much in the pipeline, and Alain will comment on that. So
why don't you start, Patrick?

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

So maybe, ﬁrst, to come back on a few reminder, the 10-point improvement that we
implemented starting last November was about two-thirds coming from rates and onethird coming from product and other actions in underwriting. Most of the rates have
started to take in place on renewals last November. So, in fact, we're almost done.
So starting in November of this year, the coming months will fully reﬂect the rate increase.
But most of our underwriting actions were started in April and May of 2014. So it's only at
that time in 2015 that our results will fully reﬂect it. However, there is inﬂation in the
system, so there are further rate increases that are coming through at the next cycle to

Page 6 of 24



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2014-11-05

cover that part. But I would say that, starting at the end of Q1 next year, our results will
pretty much fully reﬂect our 10-point improvement plan.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

FINAL

Thanks, Patrick. How about you, Alain?

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

Well, I think, at this point, it's diﬃcult to call as to when everything will be earned because
not all actions are being taken place at the same time and still are, like you said, Charles,
some are still in the pipeline. But a good example of that is, let's say, on the rate increase
side, we've always been pushing rate increase quarter-by-quarter to the tone of 1% or 2%
in the past, but we've increased that gradually in 2013 to reach a rate increase close to 5%
in 2014. So that's still going on.
We've also introduced a minimum deductible on ﬂood that hit most of our book starting
in June this year. We've introduced in September a new rating algorithm for ﬂood and
sewer backup. Again, that will take another year to go through and we are tweaking
continuously our segmentation on rate increase at renewal. And in fact, without changing
our plan, we've always focused our rate increase on the worst 25%, but we are now
introducing an even enhanced focus on the worst 3% to 5%, okay, where we're going to
see a substantial rate increase because this book is really completely underpriced. We're
talking a rate increase that could hit doubling the premium. That...

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

You're talking about the worst 3% to 5%.

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

The worst 3% to 5%, exactly, just to make sure, yes, the worst 3% to 5% will basically see
substantial rate increase. Considering the disruption that create with our broker, we've
given them more lead time to deal with that situation, and that will gradually hit our book
starting January 2015.
So some of those actions are all piling up among themselves, so it's diﬃcult to see when
we can say everything will be earned considering also in fact that there is inﬂation towards
– (19:25) in the system.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. So I think maybe to sum up commercial lines, as far as I'm concerned, we've been
working on the worst 25% of the book for a full year. And starting in 2014, that started to
generate close to 5%. So as far as I'm concerned, when you hit the ﬁrst quarter of 2015,
you should have the full eﬀect of that sort of 5% movement that we're seeing throughout
2014. But I think that we are trying to ﬁnd areas of underperformance constantly in
general, but in particular, in our commercial lines portfolio at the moment, then you can
certainly see us continuing to work on that on an ongoing basis and certainly for as long
as the market will allow it.
Page 7 of 24



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp

Date: 2014-11-05

FINAL

And I think the main point is that the market seems to oﬀer up opportunities because
we're seeing capacity shrinking in certain segment. We're starting rates ﬁrm up in certain
segments and we're going as far as we can in that context. But my expectation, if you look
at the ﬁrst half of 2015, I'm hoping to see the impact of what we've been doing in the past
18 months in commercial lines.

Q - John C. Aiken

{BIO 21267604 <GO>}

And then, Charles, just as a follow-on within the commercial lines, given the fact that the
renewals have been stronger than what you had originally anticipated, should we expect
that this pricing increase policy to carry on through 2015 and maybe even into 2016?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes, I think that's the way to think about it, John.

Q - John C. Aiken

{BIO 21267604 <GO>}

Great, thank you very much. I'll re-queue.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Thank you.

And our next question comes from the line of Geoﬀ Kwan from RBC Capital Markets. Your
line is open.

Q - Geoﬀrey Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Hi there, good morning. First question I had was just looking at the expense ratio on your
various business segments. I mean, they had pretty good improvements quarter-overquarter and year-over-year. Just wondering if you can talk about the sustainability of it and
maybe provide some additional color around some of the things that were driving the
improvements.

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Sure. So let me do it overall by line of business, the allocations are a bit tricky. But on an
overall basis, I would say three drivers here. First, on the commissions, a bit of an
improvement there. Part of it a catch-up from prior years on the results of the ﬁrst half and
a bit of structural impact as well that reduced the impact this quarter.
Secondly, on comp, on some compensation, there were some adjustments to our
bonuses due to our – as compared to last year, we're accruing a bit less than last year and
mostly due to growth in this year compared to last year. The third element is really savings
initiatives we've taken on from the ﬁrst half of the year to reduce costs. I think they've
come together in this quarter and we expect that it will revert back to a bit higher levels

Page 8 of 24



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2014-11-05

going forward. So this is, I would say, a strong quarter from an expense point of view, but I
would expect next quarters to go back to a bit more past levels basically.

FINAL

Q - Geoﬀrey Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Okay, thanks. And then the second question I had was just looking at the personal
property side of the business, you talk about a combined ratio of 95% or less, and if – just
for easy math, if you kind of say 95% and let's just assume a 33% expense ratio, that would
imply a 62% claims ratio. Now, in terms of how you look at the underwriting to that 62%
claims ratio, do you kind of model in how much of that might come from cat losses, and if
so, like, how much might that be?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Do you want to take it, Patrick?

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Yeah. We – overall, if we take a long-term average, we've talked about in the past I think
the $50 million per quarter that we were expecting in cat losses, that was all lines
combined. When we factor in the property, it's between – around close to 15 points now
of premium, so 15 points of loss ratio that could come from cats in coming years.

Q - Geoﬀrey Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

And, Geoﬀ, just so we're clear, we say that we want to operate that business sub-95% in
good times and in bad times, maybe not in extreme times, but certainly in bad times.
We're pricing the business to do better than 95%, just so we're clear.

Q - Geoﬀrey Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Sure. Absolutely. I was just trying to use round numbers, so, okay. Thank you.

Operator
And our next question comes from Shubha Khan from National Bank Financial. Your line is
open.

Q - Shubha Khan

{BIO 16255963 <GO>}

Thanks. Good morning. Just the one question with respect to Ontario auto. So, again, I
guess, you reiterated the view that you can protect the combined ratio there. And just so
I'm clear about how you're thinking about this, would it be appropriate to assume that the
6% in average rate reductions announced by the industry so far can be oﬀset by cost
reduction measures already announced? And so, the further – and so further government
action is required for the remaining 8% or 9% in rate reductions?

Page 9 of 24



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2014-11-05

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

FINAL

So, I think there are diﬀering views about what's been announced already and how much
that's worth because, depending on how you run your business, these measures will have
an impact that will diﬀer from one company to the other. In aggregate, we're not that far
from the measures that have been already announced is what I will say.
If you look ahead, the government still has in mind to reduce rates by 15%, so there's 8
points to 9 points missing. There's Bill 15 on the table at the moment, that is moving nicely
through the Legislative Assembly. That will be worth a few points. And the government is
considering a range of additional measures to get closer to 15%. And therefore, our
expectation is that we will see momentum on the cost reduction front going forward.
If you look at where we are today, there have been a number of measures that have been
implemented either through the budget in August last year, earlier in February this year.
There has been an election in June, as you know, and yet, despite all of that, now there's a
bill on the table, that is Bill 15, progressing well. So there is a fair bit of momentum,
especially when you take into account the fact that there's been an election halfway this
year. And I mean these guys get it. They're smart, they're focused on Ontario drivers. And
so far, we're comfortable that we're very much in line with what we see as the base
scenario, which is symmetry between cost and premiums.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Shubha Khan

{BIO 16255963 <GO>}

Okay. But clearly, more is required at least by the industry in order to make up the
remaining 8% or 9% in rate reductions. And so, I'm curious as to whether you have a
sense on the timing of further sort of cost reduction measures and what, in particular, you
might be looking forward to?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. Why don't I ask Mathieu, our SVP, Claims, to talk about some of the elements in Bill
15 and then some of the areas where you expect or would like to see more cost reduction
measures to get closer to 15% in the near term.

A - Mathieu Lamy

{BIO 15207469 <GO>}

Sure. So, in Bill 15, there's three elements on the claims side that we expect is going to
help us. First, ﬁxing the dispute resolution system as recommended by the Justice
Cunningham Report in last February, lowering the prejudgment interest rate on noneconomic damage, that's going to help us, and the measures on the towing and storage
costs. That's going to help us control the worst operator in the business. So those are
three important elements of Bill 15 that should help us control costs.
In our discussion with government, in terms of further measure to help us control costs,
we're discussing a new cat deﬁnition, shortening the med, rehab beneﬁt period from 10
years to four years, discussing the disappearing deductible on the torts line and
eliminating some of the fees on the tort side, too. So those are in discussion. Hopefully,
we're successful inﬂuencing the direction there.

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

FINAL

Thank you, Mathieu. I think it's fair to say indeed that Bill 15 will certainly move the needle,
but then if you want to really get closer to 15%, you have to focus on catastrophic injuries
on AB and on the tort-related side of things. And I think the government has a number of
good ideas on that front. It might be worthwhile to spend just a few seconds on clinic
regulation and what's happened on that front in the past six months.

A - Mathieu Lamy

{BIO 15207469 <GO>}

Yes, the intent of Bill 65 was to regulate clinic and mainly to license them and restrict
payments from insurers to only licensed clinic in the industry. This is taking place this year.
Clinics are getting licensed right now. It is to be eﬀective December 1 this year. It's
positive. The jury is still out, though, how eﬀective it will be.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. My understanding is that 82% of clinics have been registered so far, which is quite
good. I think the question for us as a ﬁrm here in terms of how much that's worth is that
you will recall that in 2010, we basically revamped our claims operation to tackle
fraudsters, and that really moved the needle for us. And for those who've followed our
story back then, we said the reforms will be worth 6 (30:20), our own actions will be worth
6 (30:22). A big chunk of that 6 (30:23) was actually around fraud monitoring and
mitigating fraud.
So, we'll see how much that's worth to us, but I think if we take a broad perspective at the
industry level, clinic regulation is actually a very good move and they're making really
good progress.

moving and how Intact is positioned in this?

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes. I think, from our perspective, if you take a 36 to 60-month perspective starting now,
we think there'll be 15 points to 20 points of market share that will change hands. We
used to say 25-ish points, and there's been more than 10 points in the past three years
actually that have changed hands. Half of that we've done through AXA and Jevco.
So I think we've demonstrated then that when market share change hands, we have an
ability to act on that. That hasn't changed. And in fact, the fact that our integrations are
ﬁnished at this stage means that, operationally speaking, we're ready to grow
inorganically, so to speak. When we look at the environment today, there's nothing that
points to any reason to change our view that there will be 15 points to 20 points of market
share that will change hands over the coming, say, ﬁve years. But as I've mentioned
before, we don't think it'll be back-ended necessarily. We think it'll happen throughout
just as we've seen in the past three years.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay. And maybe just as a follow-up, I think you used to give total guidance with respect
to cat losses of $200 million a year, and it used to look – it looks to be around 2.5 points to
3 points on the combined. If I look, it was a great call in 2008 through maybe 2010 or
maybe part of 2011, but of late it hasn't been.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Right.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

I know you're not in the business of predicting weather, but how should we be looking at
that going forward? Obviously, 2013 was a tough year and so far in 2014, it's probably
running higher than that. So how should we be thinking about a cat load?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. I think your observation is correct, Tom. I think you're right on. I mean, if you look at
the past three years, it certainly has been above the sort of average cat that one should
expect. I would say that, sitting here today, our perspective is pretty much still around that
level because we've introduced a bunch of measures aimed at curbing the cost of these
catastrophes. I think the impact in 2013 was 7.7 points, so that's a lot of points, 7.7 points
related to cat.
For us, that was one outside the curve, and so I think if you look at the average, excluding
that, you're not too far from 3%. And then we've put a bunch of cost reduction measures
in place, and that's the number we're still keeping in mind. In other words, a run rate of
about 50 (34:47) knowing there's seasonality obviously for quarter to quarter. But that's
still the number we have in mind. And I think when we change our perspective on that,
we'll make sure that it's made very clear to you, guys.

And our next question comes from the line of Doug Young from Desjardins Capital. Your
line is open.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Good morning.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So just wanted, Charles, to go back to the commercial P&C business because, in your
prepared remarks, you kind of talked a bit about sustainability and you said there were
several positives that came through. Just wondering, can you kind of go through what
those positives were, what the unusual items are? Because, I mean, an 84.7% combined
ratio in the quarter, I would imagine you would guide me not to punch that into my
model. And I know you're targeting around 90% over the year or bringing for the year
down towards 90%. So I'm just trying to get a sense of what the outsized return was this
quarter and what we should be expecting in that business.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Okay. So I think that my comments, Doug, were basically that I look at this business after
nine months and I'm assuming that's about the run rate in that business and that's about
97% combined ratio. We're working hard at corrective measures that have been
described earlier, and Alain touched on that, and we're pricing that business to be in the
low 90s. I don't think we said 90%, but certainly low 90s. So 97% just doesn't cut it; it's not
good enough. So, that's the ﬁrst sort of point in terms of direction that we expect.
If you look at what happened in the quarter, prior year development was slightly better
than before. Large losses were slightly lower than what we've experienced historically and
cat losses were also slightly lower than what we have experienced historically. And it's on
the basis of those three elements that we're seeing that many elements were slightly
better than what they've been historically.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Yeah. I guess where I'm confused is, I mean, the underwriting results in the quarter were
$62 million. If I look at the last 10 quarters, I mean, on average, it's been $4 million, and so
the delta is huge. And I know there has been some big losses in those past quarters and
some big gains. And I'm trying to get a sense as kind of the right number kind of in
between those, trying to get this because I know the last 10 quarters have been obviously
some diﬃcult times, too. So that's where I'm trying to go with it.

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah. Doug, I think, if you look at the slides that we've produced for the call, I would – I
think there's a slide that talks about the commercial P&C action plan. And what we do in
there is we actually break the performance by components. You'll see clearly the cats,
you'll clearly see the favorable development and the underlying performance. The only
thing you don't see in there is the large loss weight, and (38:11) maybe, Alain, can you
comment on large losses for the quarter?

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

Yes. In general, you don't see that, but our historical level of large losses is in around
about 16 points, but it has varied from quarter-to-quarter anywhere between, let's say, 9.5
points to about 22 points. So there's interim volatility in the result there that are eﬀective
(38:35). And this quarter, our large losses came in at about 12 points, where (38:38)
there's about 4 points below historical average, okay, which aﬀected and inﬂuenced, I
would say, favorably our result in the quarter.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Well, that gives me a little bit of color. And then just wanted to go back thinking
about Ontario auto, and it's a market I've struggled with trying to kind of ﬁgure out – and I
understand everything that you're saying, I guess. Some of the – one of the kind of things I
wanted to kind of get a sense of was – well, the (39:10) two items. We've had some
rulings, I would imagine, coming through an arbitration. I'm just interested if there's been
any rulings in the arbitration that have come through that are concerning to you.
And then the auto pool or the risk-sharing pools, I know that you showed the delta in the
auto pools. What are – are the auto pools generating a loss, or the allocation, is that a loss
for you? Can you quantify how much that is? And are you starting to see, because of some
of the changes happening, the auto pool starting to grow here again?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Doug, I think the best way to tackle this is I'll ask Mathieu to talk about mediation and
arbitration decision and how that shapes our view of the world. And then I'll ask Patrick to
talk about pools and we'll see if we can tackle your question this way. Why don't you go,
Mathieu?

A - Mathieu Lamy

{BIO 15207469 <GO>}

In terms of arbitration, the outcome of those decisions are – there's no really adverse
decision in the last quarter and in the – even though in the last few years actually, the
decisions that have been rendered are maintaining the spirit or the intention of the
reform. So I'd say there it's positive. And when there was a bit of doubt, the government
has reacted swiftly. So that leads us to believe that the intent of the reforms are going to
be maintained.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Mediation, same sort of story, I think.

A - Mathieu Lamy

{BIO 15207469 <GO>}

Yes. Mediations are not binding by nature, so the only downside there, there's a huge
backlog and there's very few decisions rendered on post-reform cases at this point.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

FINAL

Right.

A - Mathieu Lamy

{BIO 15207469 <GO>}

I'd say that's why there's still uncertainty in the system, but those that have been rendered
are maintaining the spirit of the reform.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I think, Mathieu, for Doug's beneﬁt, if you go back to 2012, there have been a few
meaningful decision, which we actually talked about on the call such as (41:13) and all of
that having an impact on cats.

A - Mathieu Lamy

{BIO 15207469 <GO>}

Yes, case law, not mediation, arbitration.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

That's right. It's case law, but...

A - Mathieu Lamy

{BIO 15207469 <GO>}

Yes. And so – and that's why we're recommending reform on the cats line.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Right.

A - Mathieu Lamy

{BIO 15207469 <GO>}

So those decisions are still standing, but hopefully, in the future, after Bill 15, that's why
we're discussing with government to get a new cat deﬁnition...

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes, exactly.

A - Mathieu Lamy

{BIO 15207469 <GO>}

...to enable (41:41) have more certainty on the cats.

Company Name: Intact Financial Corp

FINAL

Exactly. And I think when these decisions came out in 2012; we have made a number of
reserving adjustments as a result, talked about that with the Street and integrated that in
our pricing model. But if you go back one year, there's nothing that we see that is
concerning. One decision, I think it was in 2013, weakened the minor injury deﬁnition, and
very soon thereafter, through the budget and the February regulation, they've actually
tightened the interpretation of the minor injury deﬁnition. Is that correct?

A - Mathieu Lamy

{BIO 15207469 <GO>}

It is correct. And since then, there's another arbitration decision that reinforced that the
minor injury guidelines are in fact binding. That was...

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. It was quite big actually.

A - Mathieu Lamy

{BIO 15207469 <GO>}

Yes.
Yeah. All right. So let's move on to pools.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Well, the pool results are made up of two main things, so it's premiums and losses that we
cede to the pools and those premiums and losses that we assume because of our market
share and usage of the pools. So when we look at the quarter, Q3 of 2014, if we look at it
from a year-on-year perspective, it increases a bit the gap because 2013 was actually a
very good – Q3 2013 was a very good quarter.
But when we look at speciﬁcally the Q3 of this year, it is a loss of close to 1 point caused
by both sides. So the assumed that has been worse than the average quarter and also the
proﬁt we get from decession (43:29) that has been slightly worse. Overall, over the years,
quarter-to-quarter, it ﬂuctuates a lot, but it generates in general a slight proﬁt because we
are performing slightly better than the average of the pool in the risk we select to cede.
It's just this quarter, it's a small loss of close to 1 point.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

To Doug's question, I think the more interesting thing to look at to understand the state of
the market is the size and the growth in the Facility Association, which is a direct reﬂection
of how much capacity is available in the market. So maybe you can comment on...

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Yes, that's right. From that perspective, both the Facility Association and the risk-sharing
pools of the industry, the volumes have been stable over the past many years.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Page 16 of 24



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2014-11-05

Yeah.

FINAL

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

I would say four years or ﬁve years. In fact, we've seen a slight decrease in the Facility
Association, which is really the ﬁnal stage. So after the pools, there's the Facility
Association in the regulated markets and the volumes there have slightly decreased in
2014 compared to prior year.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. Just so we're clear, the Facility Association, for those who wouldn't be familiar with
that, is essentially if you cannot ﬁnd an oﬀer from a private carrier, there is an industry
mechanism called the Facility where you can get insured. And we haven't seen much
movement there for the past few years. We manage the facility – one of the big facility
carriers on behalf of the industry. So we have good sense of what's going on there and
there's no signs of capacity shortages based on what we see in the FA.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

All right. Just one quick one hopefully. I know the biggest item here to get the full 15%
cost beneﬁt or to oﬀset the rate reductions in Ontario auto is going to be the new cat
deﬁnition. We've had a new cat deﬁnition out there that has been proposed, but never
kind of adopted. What probability would you put on it, Charles, that you actually get a
new cat deﬁnition here? Thanks.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Oh, I would say that there's a lot of eﬀorts right now invested in looking at ways to tighten
and make the deﬁnition of what is a catastrophically injured driver, to make that deﬁnition
as tight as possible, in other words, to reduce the likelihood of leakage over time. It's not
many cases, but it represents a meaningful portion of the incurred losses.
I'd go so far as to say close to one-third of incurred losses are cat-related. So there's work
being done at the government level considering various options at this stage and I do
think that the makeup of the government will be conducive to see a change on the
deﬁnition of accident beneﬁt catastrophes. So, to your question, I would say north of 50%,
which, in this world, is pretty good.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

I'll take that. Thank you.

Good morning, Paul.

FINAL

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

First question I wanted to ask you is on Alberta auto. We've talked about some potential
cost pressure coming through on the BI side. When I look at the overall personal auto
results this quarter, it doesn't seem to have had any impact, but wondering if you can
provide us with an update there.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes. I think I'll ask Mathieu to comment on some of the things that we have in the pipeline
to curtail inﬂation and bodily injury in Alberta, which I'm very pleased with where we are
now. I think what happened in the quarter is that the catastrophe in Alberta, the hailstorm
in Alberta was 60% automobile-driven. And that's certainly an area of focus for us, but I'll
let Mathieu comment on the work we're doing in bodily injury to a little bit like we did in
Ontario ﬁve years back, really create outperformance as a result of claims management.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mathieu Lamy

{BIO 15207469 <GO>}

So this increased activity in the bodily injury ﬁles in Alberta is stemming from a decision
that happened early 2012, the Sparrowhawk decision that kind of excluded the TMJ out of
the minor injury cap and opened the door for chronic pain to be outside of the cap. Since
then, we have I think a vigorous action plan to make sure that the intent of the minor injury
cap is maintained in Alberta. So we've increased staﬀ. We have created a special handling
unit handling those cases where, with certain plaintiﬀ lawyers and when TMJ and chronic
pain is alleged, we have a special protocol to handle those cases and make sure that the
intent of the reform is maintained.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. And the claims organization has been essentially broken into teams to work on
diﬀerent degrees of pressure, so to speak, coming from the trial lawyers.

A - Mathieu Lamy

{BIO 15207469 <GO>}

Yes, triaging the more diﬃcult ﬁle and a special unit to handle that.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Exactly. And changing protocols as a result of this common law decision. And I think so
far, so good, like...

A - Mathieu Lamy

{BIO 15207469 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

...making really good progress on that point.

Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2014-11-05

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Okay. So I understand the answer correctly. Then the measures you're taking are
eﬀectively oﬀsetting cost pressures that others in the industry might be feeling.

FINAL

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes, yeah, exactly. And when we talk about underlying performance in automobile
insurance in the quarter, if you put cats aside, you see that the severity is well within check
and the frequency is actually down a bit. And that's an observation that holds pretty much
across the land.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Okay. Next question, when I look at your direct premiums written that are done through
the direct channel, it's up 12% year-over-year. So obviously quite healthy growth there.
Can you give us a sense of where that's coming from? Is it primarily Ontario auto?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

There are two areas. The area where our direct operations are growing the fastest is in
home insurance. And we've run – our combined ratio in home insurance in the direct
channel has actually been in the 80s for a long period of time. So that's a place that's
working well for us. Because it is a hard market, people are shopping and our direct
operations have beneﬁted from that.
The second area of good growth, as far as I'm concerned, in the direct channel, is indeed
automobile Ontario. I would say that we're very comfortable with our pricing position
there. We're very comfortable with our selection mechanism, as well as how we manage
claims. So I would say home insurance, one, and then Ontario auto, two.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Good. And then, Charles, earlier, you mentioned that there continues to be cost inﬂation
in personal property, no surprise there. But wondering if you can give us a sense of what
kind of cost inﬂation you're seeing outside of cats and, therefore, what kind of rate
increases we might see in 2015?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I'm not sure I talked about cost inﬂation much in personal property outside of cats at this
stage, but I'll let Patrick comment on your question.

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

I agree. I think, beside cats, I would say just the normal inﬂation in the cost of material and
labor, but not more – not inﬂation in frequency, for example, outside of cats, more the
normal (52:21).

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Page 19 of 24



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2014-11-05

FINAL

Yeah. No. Exactly right. I would say, Paul, if I look at how personal prop – let's take nine
months, for instance – is shaping up on a current accident year basis. Frequency is down 1
point, severity is up 2 points, but then, as you know, our sum (52:40) insured is up 3
points. So net-net, the cost equation is actually improving, so to speak. And then on top of
that, you add the rates, and that's why we feel pretty conﬁdent that our results in personal
property are headed in the right direction.
As Patrick has mentioned, two-thirds of our action plan was rates, the rest was basically
either product changes or cost reduction measures. And Mathieu, in claims, is working
really hard at reducing the cost equation and we think that's working. So maybe, Mathieu,
you want to give a few examples of what you're doing on the property side of things to
keep the cost equation in check?

A - Mathieu Lamy

{BIO 15207469 <GO>}

Well, ﬁrst, we're working hard to internalize most of our adjusting, so we have reduced
our alliance on external adjuster. And we think, given process and technology, we do a
better job on scope and controlling costs when we do those losses internally. We've
worked hard also on securing capacity ahead of events to help us respond to – to respond
to big events or cat losses. And we're working ahead of events on protocol on how we're
going to handle water losses and restoration with diﬀerent vendors to enable us again to
contain the scope of the work we have to do and ultimately the indemnity overall.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And that, Paul, is not just in the case of cats.

A - Mathieu Lamy

{BIO 15207469 <GO>}

No.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

It's in all cases. So we really cranked up control around appraisal, on-site reviews and
things of that nature.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Got it. All right. So water losses were a pressure in the past on the cost side, but given the
action you're taking, that's no longer the case. Okay.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Well, no.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

No?

Page 20 of 24

I wouldn't put it like that. I think that we're certainly correcting the pressure there, but
we're not done and we're seeing momentum in the right direction, but I wouldn't want
anyone to feel comfortable about us having tamed water damage at this stage.

FINAL

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Okay, okay. Next question, on the commercial P&C side, you said the average rate
increase year-to-date is 5%. I think the average last quarter was 5%. So I'll take away that
the average this quarter was also 5%?

A - Alain Lessard

{BIO 17592535 <GO>}

Just short of being 5% rate increase on renewal on the quarter.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Okay, so roughly 5%. Okay.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I think, Paul, what I liked about the quarter in commercial lines, of course, other than the
85% combined ratio, is the fact that our ability to sell has improved despite what we've
done. And I think our retention has been fairly strong. So it's one thing to get rate
increases; it's something else to grow in the market. And I feel we're in a better spot in Q3
than we were in the ﬁrst part of the year. And I think it's the combination of both that
we're positive about.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Okay. A ﬁnal question, there were some mark-to-market losses on the common equity
portfolio in Q3. Looking at what the market did in October and some of your exposure to
the energy sector, wondering if you're taking any response or change in security
allocation post quarter-end.

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Nothing speciﬁc, Paul. The mix is staying fairly stable. We're monitoring it obviously, but
there is no change in direction speciﬁcally on the allegations here.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Okay. Got it.

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

We are monitoring obviously the energy sector carefully.

A - Charles Brindamour

unrealized gain is pretty solid across the board. But obviously, we're looking at the

And our next question comes from Mario Mendonca from TD Securities. Your line is open.

Q - Mario C. Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Perhaps an all-encompassing question that would capture a lot of the things you've
discussed on the call so far. In your opening remarks, you referred to the company's
ability to outpace the market or the industry in terms of ROE. But I didn't get a good
sense of what you think on an absolute basis your company's ROE capacity is. And if you
could talk about that sort of in the context of what we've seen so far, like over the last 12
months, about a 15% GAAP ROE, but there was some elevated cats in there. So, could you
help us think through, on an absolute basis, what you think this company's ROE capacity
is?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

So, the industry has generated 10% over time. And if you look at 30 years or within cycles
of seven years, you always tend to revert back to about 10%. We've said as a ﬁrm that we
want to beat the industry by 500 basis points every year, which we have a pretty good
track record of doing.
We also said that we're actually gearing the machine to generate more than 500 basis
points because there are moments in time when the industry's performance is just not
acceptable to only beat it by 500 basis points. And if you look at the industry
performance in the past ﬁve years, six years, it hasn't been really good, quite frankly. And
that's why we've outperformed by 700 basis points, as I've mentioned in my remark,
which is not too far from how we're planning our actions.
We're asking Mathieu in claims to generate 300 basis points of ROE outperformance.
We're asking the folks on pricing and risk segmentation to generate 200 basis points of
ROE outperformance. Then from investment management and capital management,
we're hoping to generate another 200 basis points ROE outperformance.
Now, I'm not saying that you should expect the machine to generate 700 basis points of
ROE outperformance because we think that there are points in the cycle where you ought
to reinvest to grow faster at high ROE. We think that's the best way to calibrate the
economic levers in the business. We're planning for more. We're saying the objective is
Page 22 of 24



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2014-11-05

500 basis points. The ROE of the industry is about 10%. So, in theory, you should expect
north of 15% performance in the long run and we're planning for a little more than that;
however, we keep room to reinvest. That's how I think about this.

That's helpful. And so when you said there are times when it's appropriate to reinvest in
the business for better top line growth, and you said when the ROE is high, so what is a
high ROE that would encourage you to reinvest for growth?

When you get in the upper teens, Mario, when you get close to 18%, 19%, 20% type ROE,
you really ought to ask yourself what one additional point of growth is worth and whether
there's an economic logic to reinvest. And that's in that context that I talk about that.

And then, ﬁnally, excluding anything to do with cats, like, if you just consider the previous
12 months have been a normal cat period, do you think there's momentum in ROE at this
point on an absolute basis for your company, not in relation to the industry? Would you
expect ROEs to be improving because of all the actions you're taking?

So let me ﬁrst say, Mario, that 2013 was a real bad year. I mean, we got hit on all fronts.
And that's certainly reﬂected in the industry's ROE, and our own operating ROE was about
11% in what was a real bad year. I think that's a point that's important to understand. To get
back to your question, is there momentum in the ROE?
Well, ﬁrst point that I will make is that, if you look at the underwriting performance,
automobile insurance, we think, if you leave cats aside, we think we're in a largely neutral
territory there. I say that not just because of Ontario, but I see pluses and minuses from
coast to coast. We see rates up in Alberta; we see rates fairly ﬂat across the land. We see a
decent stability in costs in automobile insurance. And I would say this is an area where we
don't necessarily see or expect much margin expansion.
I think, though, if you look at home insurance, there's clearly momentum on that front.
And the actions that we're taking are bound to have an impact, and they have so far this
year. And I would say same thing in commercial lines. If you look 12 months, the
performance in commercial lines is completely unacceptable. And I think everybody feels
that here. And that's why we've been taking action for a year or over a year. And to me,
that should bring an improvement to the performance in that line of business because
what we've done in the past year is just not good.
I'll let you judge on the interest and capital investment income and capital markets side of
things. You're probably better equipped than I on that front. And then it's a question of
using our capital eﬀectively. And that's clearly an area where there's a lot of focus for my

team in terms of expanding the business in economically very attractive ways. That's
another lever in my mind.
