{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this conference call on Sampo Group's Second
Quarter 2017 Results. I'm Jarmo Salonen, Head of Investor Relations at Sampo. And with
me at this call, I have Kari Stadigh, our Group CEO and President; Torbjörn Magnusson,
Head of P&C Insurance; and Peter Johansson, Group CFO.
We'll have the same procedures. As always, Kari will start with the review of second
quarter developments. Before handing over to Kari, let me just remind you that you can
follow this call at sampo.com/result, and a recorded version of the call will later be
available at the same address.
With these words, I'll hand over to Kari. Kari, please.

Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Thank you, Jarmo. Welcome to the conference call on my behalf as well. Sampo's
insurance operations had a very strong second quarter, as usual, maybe best ever among
them, the best ever combined ratio for the ﬁrst six months.
P&C insurance proﬁt before taxes was up 14% and the life insurance proﬁt before taxes
was up 23% compared to the corresponding quarter last year. Nordea published their
results already a while ago and you have all seen them. So I leave that part for a possible
Q&A.

On capital, in general, it is worth noting the extraordinary strong position all of our
corporations enjoy. IF's Solvency II ratio with a standard model is higher than ever before
at 225% and also, for Mandatum Life, the Solvency ratio with a standard model and
transitional is highest ever at 205%. Nordea's ability to generate capital is also remarkable
and its core Tier 1 ratio improved to an all-time high number at 19.2%. The strong capital
position in all our entities, together with a very strong cash ﬂow, our operations generate
from a very good basis for a proposal to increase our dividends also next spring as
planned.
I would like to ﬁnish my opening remarks with some comments on our strategic
positioning. We can clearly see that our clients demand a very simple and easy access
based on a digital oﬀering. Nordea has a massive transformational project going on in
this area and IF is investing more than ever in IT platform and new software. Both
companies have decided to have the best digital oﬀering available in the Nordic market.
Nothing less is acceptable for market leaders with the biggest scale beneﬁts among their
peers.

Bloomberg Transcript

In P&C insurance, speciﬁcally, IF, with the smallest branch network among its peers and
the only one with the true Nordic reach, is best positioned to beneﬁt from this
development. The investments in the new platforms must also deliver gradually cost
based (03:30) savings. IF has for many years been committed gradually improving cost
ratio and Nordea stated in their release that their costs in 2018 would return to the level of
2016. All this, of course, based on investments in our digital future.
To conclude, our short-term outlook is very good and therefore, we have lowered our
guidance for our combined ratio with one notch, but also our strategic positioning in the
digital world is right in the sweet spot. So all-in-all, a dividend stock based on stable and
predictable earnings as always.

Thank you, Kari, and operator, we are now ready for the questions, please.

Q&A
Operator
We'll take our ﬁrst question from Ida Gjøsund with Carnegie.

Q - Ida Melvold Gjøsund
Yes, good afternoon, Ida from Carnegie here. Four questions from me, please. Firstly, on
the combined ratio, on the group level, if I deduct large claims and reserve releases, the
underlying combined ratio actually slightly improved in Q2 compared to the same period
last year. Is this positive development coming from the price increases you have
undertaken to address recent claims inﬂation in motor?

FINAL

And secondly, on the combined ratio in the private segment, it is 1% up in Q2 year-overyear. What are the drivers of this development? And third, on the business in IF Norway,
adjusting for FX eﬀects, the underlying growth in Norway seems to be increasing. Can
you elaborate a bit on what the drivers of this are?
And last, on the continued negative growth in Finland, last quarter, you mentioned price
competition in the retail motor business, any updates on the market conditions, and when
do you expect this to improve? Thank you.

A - Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

Thanks for all the questions on IF P&C. We've had what I see is a very, very strong ﬁrst half
year this year. And the change in the combined ratio compared to last year is by non-life
standards very small, but of course, it is we have improved the cost level slightly, as Kari
mentioned, I think for the ninth year in a row, oﬀ the top of my head and we aim to
continue to do that.
When it comes to the precise development of the claims inﬂation compared to rate
increases, well, claims inﬂation is very, very low, by and large in the Nordic region,
between 1.5% and 2%. And rate increases are to the same tune and the diﬀerence is so
small. It is diﬃcult to say exactly what the outcome in two decimals will be from that.

Bloomberg Transcript

Private business area is basically the same combined ratio as last year the same period.
We had more prior year gains last year than we have this year, so that's the reason for that.
Norway, your third question, that's probably the most signiﬁcant development this year.
We've come to the, I guess, predictable point in time where the previously aggressive
newcomers to the market have been forced to stop being so aggressive. The likes of
Nemi, especially Vardia, but also Storebrand are much less visible in the market and we
have positive customer exchanges with them this year. And of course, we all know the
background for that. If you are too aggressive over a long – protracted period of time, you
run into ﬁnancial diﬃculties, as it's pretty apparent from Vardia's development.
Finland, well, the Finnish market has gone through a half year of turbulence where there
was a change in the law around motor third-party. The customers were made aware of this
and have been very active in the market. The ﬁrst company to adjust the product to that
was LähiTapiola. They won a lot of customers in the ﬁrst quarter, we came out in May and
have won back a large number of those customers. And I would cautiously expect a more
stable development in the Finnish market going forward than this.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

(08:37) also that benign weather, winners always need a little bit luck also, so hasn't
(08:43) the weather helped us somewhat during the ﬁrst half year.

Yes, Kari. I was hoping you wouldn't say that, but yes, that's correct. We of course had the
best winter than that we've seen in many, many years, and in addition to that, we've had a
summer completely without thunderstorms and ﬂoods, which usually occur to some
degree in Denmark and Norway.

FINAL

Q - Ida Melvold Gjøsund
Okay. So this half year was better in terms of weather than last periods or last year?

A - Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

I think this was the best weather year from an insurance perspective for a long, long time.

Q - Ida Melvold Gjøsund
Okay. Perfect. Many thanks.

Operator
We'll take our next question from Matti Ahokas from Danske Bank.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Good afternoon. It's Matti here from Danske. A question, please, ﬁrstly, on the
Swedish non-life business, (09:45) elaborate a bit on the claims development there, were
there any prior year losses or what was the reason for the weaker development?
The other question is I noticed that you've stopped reporting the Solvency margin
according to the partial internal model. And if you would have reported that, would that
show the similar development as the rest of the group in terms of the Solvency margin or
maybe what was the ﬁgure if you would have published that? Thanks.

A - Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

On the Swedish combined ratio, ﬁrst, there is no signiﬁcant development there at all.
We've had two large losses in Sweden in the second quarter that make the results slightly,
you could say, worse, but it's still a decent combined ratio, but slightly worse than they
would otherwise have been. And that's the whole reason for any change from last year.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

On the internal model, actually, we have a partial internal model on IF Sweden. Now,
when we ﬁnish the branchiﬁcation of Finland, then, we will, of course, broaden the
internal model for IF Finland also.

A - Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

Which is an application that will take another six months with the Swedish authorities.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

That was the reason you didn't publish the ﬁgure?

FINAL

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Yeah, actually, so for external purposes, there is really no need, because the standard
formula, that's the one we have to use when we calculate IF Group capital position and
also when we calculate Sampo Group capital position. And the relevant or the actual
limiting factor in the – for IF is the rating, single A rating target.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Right. It would just be nice to see it anyway.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Okay. We can show it next week when we have the (12:00).

Operator
We'll take our next question from Paul De'Ath with RBC.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Paul De'Ath
Yeah. Hi there and a couple of questions, please. Firstly, just on the combined ratio, you
talked I think last quarter out being almost essentially this being a peak level of
proﬁtability and it could be diﬃcult to maintain the combined ratio at this level. Is that still
what your kind of longer-term view and if so, how long do you think you can keep it at
these kind of levels? First question.
And then, the second point is just on the Solvency ratios, obviously very, very high in both
IF and Mandatum. At the moment, do you have any kind of view on a target of rating
range for the Solvency ratio? Do you feel that that's too high at the moment or you're
quite happy for the ratio to keep moving up over time? Thanks.

A - Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

I'll take the ﬁrst question. I'm not sure I call it or anyone here call it a peak level, but I just
say that inﬂation and rate changes are not very diﬀerent from each other, and they're both
very low. And of course, the expectation from that would be that the combined ratio
doesn't move very quickly from where it is at the moment in the market.
I'm actually pleased with the ﬁrst six months also from the perspective that Kari detailed in
his ﬁrst words and that's that we have been able to continue to invest in modernization, in
concentration and in the web oﬀering to our clients and that of course won't – will drive
any changes for the longer future and I'm not going to speculate about how long that
development will take. Other than that, we are the market leader in that development and
we aim to continue to be that, together with the cost advantages that that gives us.

Company Name: Sampo Oyj

FINAL

Yeah. We don't have any target levels for the Solvency ratios. I think that we are clearly
over-capitalized as a group in many aspects. At this moment, we haven't had any need to
optimize our capital structure. One day if that would come, then it would be diﬀerent. I
was today educated that some very big Central European insurance companies, they are
stress testing themselves so that if they take the 2007-2008 scenario and the equity dropoﬀ that's mainly due they would still want to maintain 135% Solvency ratio after that.
We are, of course, much, much higher than that, because the eﬀect of a crash like that
would be roughly 53% on our Solvency ratio. So if you deduct 53% from the numbers I
mentioned in the beginning, we are still clearly over-capitalized. So if need be at one
moment, then we have ample room to release capital or invest in something attractive.

Q - Paul De'Ath
Excellent. Thanks.

Operator
We'll take our next question from Youdish Chicooree with Autonomous Research.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Good afternoon, everyone. I've got two questions, please. The ﬁrst one is your main
Norwegian competitor has ﬂagged – has seen worse underlying trends in property and
workers' compensation. So I was wondering whether you're seeing similar type of trends
in that market. I appreciate your results are solid, but just wondering even if anecdotally
you're seeing these trends.
And secondly, your ﬁxed income running yield is now at 1.6% and I was just wondering
what's the average reinvestment rate in your P&C business from ﬁxed income at the
moment. Thank you.

A - Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

Our main competitor...

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Hello?

A - Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

... (16:26) and also ourselves are seeing some competition in motor, workers' comp,
maybe property, but the combined ratios in Norwegian markets are extremely low, and I
don't expect them to come any lower. But we don't see any particular pressure that is new
this quarter at all.

Reinvestment rates, I think we are below 1% depending on what we ﬁnd there in diﬀerent
asset classes, but below 1% is the rate.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Thank you very much.

Operator
We'll take our next question from Per Grønborg with SEB.

Q - Per Grønborg
Yes. Thank you. Two questions from my side. First, related to Mandatum, you are now
provisioning additional €74 million for low weights (17:27). What if you should discount the
full book on the Solvency II curve? How much additional would that require? That was the
ﬁrst question.
My second question is related to the holding company, now, we're now looking into some
of the nitty-grittys, it looks like (17:44) somewhat oﬀ compared to what we saw last year.
Can you give some guidance on what one way (17:50) should we expect for the holding
company going forward? I'm aware that there's FX losses this quarter in the holding
company.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

On your ﬁrst question full discounting with the swap curve, from the top of my head, I
can't remember the number. But every 100 basis points is roughly €320 million to €330
million. So the negative eﬀect would be big. But as you know, the guarantee book runs oﬀ
roughly €200 million per year, so by the time when we have to use the normal discount
rate. So Solvency II normal discount rate curve, then there is only a tail (18:37) left in
Mandatum.
On the holding company level, we have – it's the dollar investments that we have.
Nordea's €81 million, and of course, we saw a €20 million loss in Q2 and there probably
continues to be a small loss also in Q3 because it's unhedged. But the running yield is so
high, so we don't see any reason to hedge out the currency loss. But otherwise, the
quarterly number was pretty normal on Q2.
And (19:18) third quarter.
It runs around €4 million to €5 million.

Q - Per Grønborg
€4 million to €5 million plus, minus?

A - Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}
Page 7 of 9



Company Name: Sampo Oyj

Minus on the operation.

Q - Per Grønborg
Minus €4 million or €5 million? Okay. Yeah. Perfect. Thank you.

FINAL

Operator
We'll take our next question from Janet Demir with Morgan Stanley.

Q - Janet Demir

{BIO 19462264 <GO>}

Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. I have two, please. I was just looking at the risk
ratio for Finland and I note that it has deteriorated somewhat versus last year. I wonder if
you could comment whether this is just due to higher large losses or whether there's
anything underlying aﬀecting that.
And secondly, just looking at Mandatum, I wondered if you could comment on the
business development there. I know premiums are down somewhat. And what is your
long-term goals for the business? Thank you.

A - Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Especially Finland in Q1 was aﬀected by lowering the discount rate from 1.5% to 1.2%.
That's the only big eﬀect this year and then, apart from that, actually, the risk ratio is better
in Finland than last year.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

On Mandatum, I think that we have to do a little bit of segmenting and see what the
underlying businesses are. First, it has of course the consumer business which, to a large
extent, will be sold or is sold to Danske. So as you remember, we agreed that they would
buy the portfolio from us for €334 million. And it will take some time, because this is a
portfolio transfer for this to close. It might be that it is by the end of next year – or not until
the end of next year and then we deduct from this €334 million, €18 million plus per year
from the purchase price, because it is producing to us more than that.
So this is one part of the business which we sold out. Then – and if you ask what is the
present development, especially this part which is now sold, the volume in that part has
dropped. Altogether, the volume was down 14% if I remember right. And at this moment,
the volume is 50/50 divided between consumer business and corporate business.
The corporate business is something which we maintain and there we are actually the
market leader in Finland. So our target is to continue to be the market leader with a big
margin to the number two, we have more than 50% market share in that business in some
products, up to 80%. We are going to be the leading corporate pension provider in
Finland.

FINAL

Then, the third leg is the wealth management business where we sell products under
insurance wrappers (22:31) and also under mutual funds and that is the business which we
want to grow and it is growing. There, we concentrate mainly on equities and alternatives
nowadays, but we have a base in the ﬁxed income part.
And the last leg is, of course, with proﬁt portfolio which is in semi-run-oﬀ or run-oﬀ and
there, we treat it as a hedge fund where we pay the policyholders the discount rate and
we keep, as an owner, the upside. Was that...

Q - Janet Demir

{BIO 19462264 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Kari Henrik Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Is that an adequate answer to your question? I hope so.
