FINAL

We intend to concentrate solidly on the essential facts in our presentation. This will give
us more time for a detailed question and answer round.
Following this introduction, I would now like to go to slide number 3. First of all, I would
like to present the highlights of the annual result 2010. After that, German Egloﬀ will take
you through the key ﬁnancial ﬁgures. Building on that, I will illustrate the course of
business from a market and customer perspective. To ﬁnish oﬀ, I would then like to
demonstrate to you where we are in terms of our strategic program, Baloise 2012 and will
end with our ﬁnancial outlook.
Let us start with the most important points relating to our annual result, which are
illustrated on slide number 5. Ladies and gentlemen. Baloise realized a higher proﬁt and
solid growth in 2010. Our proﬁts increased despite large claims, low interest rates and a
weak euro. In most markets, we grew at an above market rate and successfully increased
our market share. This proves that we are successfully putting the opportunities oﬀered by
the market to good use and are able to build on our market position.

Bloomberg Transcript

In our targeted customer segments, our growth was backed by our Safety World
approach. In particular, the cross-selling ratio is increasing, customer loyalty is improving
and recommendation quotas are growing.
We have launched Baloise 2012 program to advance Baloise growth and income even
more. The aim of this program is to improve the sustainable earning power of Baloise by
CHF200 million per year by 2012. This program is right on track. In 2010, we exceeded
our targets of an additional proﬁt contribution of CHF92 million generated by our
program. Its eﬀect can clearly be seen in our organic growth, our increased eﬃciency, our
lower cost ratio and our very good combined ratio performance that coped successfully
with a higher load of large claims.
Our Life business was also supported positively by Baloise 2012; combined with a higher
income from our investments, this led to increased earnings.
Our balance sheet is one of the strongest in Europe. At the end, Solvency I amounted to a
very good 224%.
A high and sustainable level of earning power is also evident in our dividend policy. Thus
the proposed dividend remains unchanged at a high CHF4.50 oﬀering an attractive
dividend yield of 4.9%.
We are further expanding our platform for proﬁtable growth by investing in our core
markets. We are proud that we were successful in substantially improving our market
position in the attractive Belgian market by two bolt-on acquisitions. These successes take
us a major step closer to our goal of becoming one of the most proﬁtable and fastest
growing insurers of Europe by 2012.

FINAL

Many thanks, Martin. I'm happy to present the result for the year 2010, and I'd like to start
with the key ﬁgures on slide 7.
Our annual results are very pleasing. It's worth noting that -- in particular, that the various
eﬃciency initiatives are now bearing fruit. Despite the challenges of the macroeconomic
environment, particularly the development of interest rates and currencies, we were able
to increase our net proﬁt by 4%.
However, the depreciation of the euro against the Swiss franc has had a negative impact
on the 2010 annual results as many of the key ﬁgures show. The closing rate relevant for
the balance sheet and impairments has fallen further; a devaluation of 15% compared to
the beginning of the year. The average rate relevant for the proﬁt contributions of foreign
companies also lost some 8% in value. Since the half-year results, interest rates have
recovered slightly. However, the positive movement could not oﬀset the negative eﬀect
from the ﬁrst half.

Bloomberg Transcript

I am very happy about the growth of business volume. In most business units, we were
able to achieve above market growth. However, due to the depreciation of the euro, the
growth rates in Swiss francs fell to a much lower level than the ﬁgures in local currencies
relevant for the assessment of the dynamics.
I now would like to explain the main drivers of our 2010 annual results and will begin with
Nonlife business on slide 8. In 2010, like in previous years, the Nonlife segment again
makes the largest contribution to the Group result.
As already mentioned, there has been a very positive growth in local currencies. In
original currency, we were able to increase Nonlife premiums by 2.2%. The ﬁrst half of the
year, as I already mentioned at the half-year results, suﬀered an above average net claims
burden of approximately CHF50 million from large claims. This includes, for example,
winter storm Xinthia and the ﬁre at the cold storage in Basel.
There were further large claims in the second half, which brings the total large claims
burden for 2010 to around CHF84 million net. This is well above our average large claims
loss expectancy of CHF45 million.
I now would like to explain the individual factors inﬂuencing the combined ratio. Slide
nine shows the main drivers for the development of the net combined ratio. I'm
particularly pleased about the positive eﬀects from ongoing eﬃciency enhancing
measures. The low costs resulted in a combined ratio improved by 2.2percentage points.

FINAL

Gains from the settlement of claims in the previous year were somewhat lower and the
large claims burden was slightly higher than last year. Moreover, the growth in Swiss
francs was impacted by the negative development of the euro, resulting on balance in a
slightly higher combined ratio.
Adjusting the loss rate by large claims and prior year loss developments, results in a
decrease of 1 combined ratio point which is within the normal range of ﬂuctuation for
weather and business mix.
Slide 10 shows the operating performance of individual business units, with most units
showing a combined ratio of well below 100%. For the Group, this results in an excellent
gross combined ratio of 92.2%. Luxembourg, in particular, had an excellent combined
ratio as, unlike last year, they beneﬁted from a very favorable claims environment. And
with 88%, Switzerland has again achieved a peak value.
However, the positive eﬀects from eﬃciency measures of around 1 combined ratio point
were more than oﬀset by the higher loss ratio due to large claims and slightly lower
results stemming from the prior year loss developments.

Bloomberg Transcript

Germany recorded signiﬁcant progress in the expense ratio, but was negatively aﬀected
by winter storm Xinthia and other large claims.
And now to slide 11, I would like to talk in more detail about the Life Insurance business.
With regard to growth ﬁgures, I would ﬁrst like to remind us of the extraordinary growth
spurt in the second half of 2009, which, fueled by the tax amnesty in Italy, impacted on
the investment linked business of Baloise Life Liechtenstein. This eﬀect was still in
evidence until April 2010.
Due to the above average previous year values, we are even more proud that we were
able to increase the business volume in local currency by 1.5%. The analysis of the growth
rate for gross premiums written shows a very encouraging growth in local currency by 5%.
A substantial portion of this growth was down to the Swiss Group Life business.
A signiﬁcantly higher ﬁnancial result -- positive results from eﬃciency measures and a
positive one-oﬀ eﬀect due to the reduction in surpluses on current life annuities resulted
in an increase in EBIT by 21%. These positive eﬀects also had a follow-on eﬀect on the
MCEV, which I would like to explore in more detail on the next slide.
Slide 12 shows the change in embedded value, which is now calculated market
consistently. I am pleased to present an operating return on embedded value of 20.3%.
This success was driven primarily by signiﬁcantly lower costs, strong growth, as well as
various operating improvements in the individual companies.
In contrast, low interest rates and currency movements had a negative impact, resulting in
a decrease of MCEV by 2.3% in Swiss francs. In the development of new business, the

FINAL

positive operating eﬀects were able to oﬀset the low interest rates, improving the new
business margin by 2.5percentage points to 11.8%.
Let us now take a look at asset management on slide 13. The volatile macroeconomic
environment will continue to be a challenge for a diversiﬁed and risk appropriate
investment strategy. The key impact on the 2010 result was the depreciation of the euro
by about 15% against the Swiss franc. This is reﬂected in various positions in the income
statement.
Firstly, Swiss bond investments suﬀer a loss in value; we counteract this eﬀect to a large
extent by hedging. Secondly, coupon payments and dividend income from investments
held in euros lose in value; this eﬀect is not hedged. Thirdly, the income of the foreign
units is reduced to the currency translation, which is not hedged either. And fourthly,
there are impairments that become only necessary as a result of converting the value of
shares to Swiss francs.
We countered the interest rate movement by slightly increasing the duration of the Life
side by buying swaptions. On the Nonlife side, we have reduced the duration by selling
bonds to take advantage of attractive market opportunities.

Bloomberg Transcript

The equity quota, including equity related investments, such as private equity and hedge
funds, remains unchanged from the previous year. You see that on the next slide. Because
of the risk/return structure, we tend to hold these asset classes in the books of Nonlife
business. How well we cope with this demanding challenge is reﬂected in the solid asset
management results. I will explain this on the following slide.
Slide 15 shows investment income according to Nonlife and Life. I would like to thank our
colleagues in Asset Management for achieving a solid result on investments in such a
demanding environment.
I also would like to point out again that the devaluation of the euro has signiﬁcantly
impacted on our results. This is particularly evident in the lower current income and
unrealized losses on ﬁxed income investments. They are oﬀset by proﬁt on currency
hedging instruments, which you ﬁnd in the position other.
Despite this, we were able to signiﬁcantly improve the performance of our investments.
This was due, among other factors, to lower asset impairment charges and higher
realizations.
I'd now like to explain the development in shareholders' equity. Slide 16 shows that the
balance of unrealized gains has slightly declined over the previous year due to
realizations and changes in market value.
Slide 17 shows the net eﬀect on equity after taking into account shares attributable to
policyholders, deferred taxes, currency translation and hedging instruments.

FINAL

Particularly standing out in this analysis of change is the position of currency translations.
They are down to the movement of the euro, and contribute considerably to the fact that
the gross balance of unrealized gains has resulted in unrealized losses of more than
CHF0.5 billion. These are participating interests of our foreign subsidiaries, i.e., the
currency translation diﬀerence to the historic purchase price.
This now takes me to the change in shareholders equity, on slide 18. The change in
unrealized gains largely explains the development of equity. In addition, shareholders
equity is further reduced by the payment of dividend, share buyback, and the absence of
minority interests, after the deconsolidation of the OVB Group. In contrast, the net proﬁt
achieved positive results.
All together, these components result in a decrease in total equity by 8%, and book value
per share of 4%. Return on equity for 2010 rose slightly, to 10.4%. Based on the solid and
good results for 2010, I now would like to show, on slide 19, the forecast on this year's
distribution to shareholders.
Based on the solid result, and strong capitalization, we plan to distribute 59% of the 2010
net proﬁt to our shareholders. We will ask the AGM to keep the dividend at last year's
high level, and pay CHF4.50 per share, as a cash dividend. For the shareholders, this
means they not only beneﬁt from a performance rate of 6%, but also receive a solid
dividend yield of 5%.

Bloomberg Transcript

In addition, we have continued with our share buyback program, which we intend to ﬁnish
by the end of April. A new share buyback is currently not scheduled.
Thank you for your attention. I now hand back to Martin Strobel.

Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

Many thanks, German. I would now like to elaborate on our business from a market and
customer perspective. To start with, let's look at growth, which is illustrated on slide 21.
In 2010, we achieved a substantial business volume growth of 1.7%. We grew at an above
market rate in most of the markets we operate in. This growth was very well balanced; we
grew in the Nonlife business, as well as in our Life business, and were able to successfully
build on a strong unit linked business.
Switzerland, our home market, grew at a high 4.5%. This growth was supported by Group
Life business in Switzerland, in particular, which grew strongly by 11.5%; successfully
increasing our market share. In Belgium, Luxemburg and Austria too, we are achieving
strong growth, and are increasing our market share.
From our operations in Liechtenstein, you can see this in the line others in the table on the
left, we expected a decline in growth since the Scudo Fiscale, the Italian tax amnesty,
ended in April 2010. Nonetheless, the decline was lower than expected, which

FINAL

demonstrates that Baloise Life has broadened its growth base successfully. Having taken a
look at growth, I would now like to provide you with some explanatory notes on the
income side. These are illustrated on slide 22.
A glance at our EBIT makes Baloise substantial operational earning power apparent. Our
EBIT grew by 8%, despite challenging market conditions. Our Swiss business, which again
proved to be a reliable earnings pillar, was confronted with a very low interest
environment, in the euro and large claims in 2010.
Germany proﬁted from substantial eﬃciency gains; improved ﬁnancial income; and
positive eﬀects from the unwinding of companies. Both Belgium and Luxemburg
achieved excellent results, especially in Nonlife business. Eﬃciency gains were realized
successfully. These were supported by a very good operational result and the positive
prior year loss experiences.
From the divisional perspective, it is clear that our Nonlife business is in great shape, and
is able to deal with the eﬀects of increases in major claims and natural disasters. In view of
this environment, we are, of course, intensifying our eﬀorts to further improve operational
excellence.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our Life business proﬁted from increased investment income, and the successful
implementation of our Baloise 2012 measures. EBIT thus increased, despite the low
interest environment and weak euro.
Our Banking division was able to improve earning power; not a given, in such eventful
times.
And now to our Swiss operations, illustrated on slide 23. In Nonlife business, our Swiss
operations achieved a very good combined ratio of 88%, despite an increased claims
burden, due to major claims. Our investment in eﬀective processes is paying oﬀ.
Despite the high number of large claims, EBIT in Nonlife was negatively aﬀected by lower
investment income, mainly caused by the weak euro. In Life business, gross premium
grew by 6.6%. We successfully increased our market share. The main source of growth
here was Group Life business, which grew at a substantial 11.5%. As an established full
service insurer, we enjoyed our customers' trust, and are able to grow with them.
With the eight of our innovative life insurance products, we were able to add a substantial
amount of new pension insurance business. Our new product, (inaudible) Time, has been
well accepted by our target customers. Its success supported the strong increase in
investment type premiums.
This increased investment income, and the successful implementation of our Baloise 2012
measures, we were able to cope successfully with the low interest environment, and the
weak euro. Both our EBIT and our new business margin improved.

Our Baloise Bank SoBa also grew substantially. As a bank with regional roots, we
beneﬁted from our trust based positioning. Our integrated pan-Swiss[ph] business model
of a focused ﬁnancial service provider, continues to prove successful.

FINAL

Besides its impressive growth, Baloise Bank SoBa was able to further increase its
eﬃciency. We implemented a new IT platform, that supports more eﬃcient processes. The
positive eﬀect can be seen in the cost income ratio, which decreased substantially.
Due to this positive growth and improved eﬃciency, Baloise Bank SoBa increased its
proﬁt to CHF21 million. You can ﬁnd more information about Baloise Bank SoBa on the
Internet, or in the appendix to this presentation.
On slide 24, I would like to give you a brief summary of our international operations. In
Germany, the realignment of Deutscher Ring entity is fully on track. Our business volume
is stable, in a demanding market, and the improved results are mainly due to substantial
eﬃciency gains, improved ﬁnancial income, and positive eﬀects from the unwinding of
companies.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our Belgium business is characterized by strong growth; with a growth rate of 8.5% in Life
and 5.2% in Nonlife business volume, we increased our market share. This is not least due
to our strong positioning, which is now strengthened further by the acquisition of Avero
and Nateus. This will further increase our market share in Nonlife business.
In Luxemburg, our local operations made substantial progress. We were able to increase
both our Life and Nonlife market share. At the same time, investment type life insurance
business gathered pace. The integration of Fortis IARD, leading to a signiﬁcant
improvement of our strategic market positioning, is progressing well.
In Austria, we're continuing to expand our insurance sales force, and so outperform the
market signiﬁcantly in growth terms, with growth of 8.7%.
In Croatia, we now have a single brand, having merged and restructured the business unit
successfully. We are number ﬁve in the market, and are systematically gearing the unit to
achieve proﬁtable growth. Nonetheless, eﬃciency improvements are oﬀset by the
continuing recessionary environment.
Baloise Life in Liechtenstein achieved strong growth, with the aid of its innovative life
products. Two product lines are driving this growth; our freedom of service business, and
the variable annuities. These products are opening up new growth segments for us that
we did not tap into before.
In addition to the organic development of Baloise, we made use of attractive bolt-on
acquisition opportunities, to strengthen our core markets further. Not least due to our
capital strength, we can invest when others have to restructure.

FINAL

All targets we look at have to pass three demanding hurdles. They have to ﬁt our business
model, they have to suit our culture, and they have to add value. We are very happy that
we were able to successfully realize three substantial bolt-on acquisitions in the last two
years, in Luxemburg and Belgium, to further strengthen our successful platforms. Both
markets belong to our core markets, and are very attractive in terms of growth prospects
and proﬁtability.
In Belgium, we doubled our market share in Life. In Nonlife, we now belong to the top ﬁve
players, with a market share of more than 6%. In Luxemburg, we now belong in both Life
and Nonlife to the top ﬁve players, with market shares of 6% and 8.5% respectively.
These improved strategic positions will allow for further strengthening of our growth
potential, as well as our proﬁtability. In addition, we might even proﬁt from macro eﬀects.
Due to our contrarian approach, buy when others have to sell, we were, for instance, able
to double our Belgian Life business in a low interest environment; oﬀering interesting
upside potential when interest rates pick up.

Bloomberg Transcript

I would now like to take you through the current status of our strategy. Let's start at slide
27. Our goal is to become one of Europe's most proﬁtable and fastest growing insurers by
2012. In actual and quantiﬁable terms, this objective is aimed at increasing Baloise's
sustainable earning power by CHF200 million per annum by 2012. In order to reach this
target, we have initiated the Baloise 2012 program. We are right in the middle of
implementation, and are fully on target.
First of all, I would like to inform you about the status of implementation. In total, the
Baloise 2012 program comprises around 100 initiatives. These are grouped under the
topic headings optimize, grow, and develop new growth segments. At the center, or one
might say also at the heart of these three topics is our new positioning strategy, Baloise
Safety World. On the lower left side of the slide, you will ﬁnd a breakdown of the CHF200
million eﬀect of Baloise 2012 by these three categories.
Where are we in terms of implementation? Many optimization initiatives are now well
advanced. Thus, our new operating model in Switzerland, the project name is GEPARD,
was successfully implemented by the end of 2010. The eﬃciency increase program in
Belgium has been approximately 75% implemented.
In Germany, we are fully on track with the unwinding of companies. In 2010, this led to a
substantial positive one-oﬀ eﬀect, contributing to the net eﬀect of Baloise 2012. In 2011,
we are now investing to reap the synergy beneﬁts from an integrated growth platform
from 2012 onwards.
Growth initiatives, detailed here, are customer retention activities in Belgium and
Switzerland, as well as the expansion of the insurance sales force in Austria, are making
good progress. Therefore, our good growth ﬁgures can also be attributed to the success
of these initiatives.

Page 9 of 33

The development of new growth segments is also making good progress. We have
already spoken about the growth ﬁgures in Liechtenstein.

FINAL

Following this overview, I would now like to take a more detailed look at three initiatives,
on slide 28. In Germany, for instance, we are applying the latest process optimization
techniques, to further improve our claims processes. The key idea of this approach is to
involve third party services in the claims process, as eﬃciently as possible.
An example might clarify this idea. When one of our car insurance customers in Germany
has a broken windscreen on his or her car, he or she sends a claim notiﬁcation to Baloise.
This notiﬁcation is scanned automatically, and is routed directly at the touch of a button to
one of our repair partners, who will contact our customer immediately, to arrange the
repair.
Our customers like this process innovation. They are contacted promptly, and the
problem is solved in a very eﬃcient manner. At the same time, our claims handling costs
are substantially lower, due to the outsourcing of data processing to our partner service.

Bloomberg Transcript

The second example of Baloise 2012 initiative stems from Switzerland. We established a
team to improve customer retention. This team identiﬁes customers who might intend to
cancel contracts with Baloise, by applying the latest customer intelligence techniques.
These customers are then contacted proactively with the so-called courtesy calls, to ﬁnd
out what we can do better to serve their needs.
The eﬀects of this approach are stunning. We reduced the churn rate of these not so
happy customers by at least 50%, or even more. This means that, by improving our
services and processes, we can successfully turn not so happy customers into happy
customers, which also has positive eﬀects on our growth.
The last example comes from Croatia. Here, we established a new cooperation with TTS
roadside assistance. This support, which is not yet established in Croatia, as a standard
oﬀer by insurance companies or car companies, oﬀers a unique advantage for our
customers, as they receive immediate assistance, if they have a problem with their car. Is
there a better way to prove our claim, we make you safer to our customers? Reactions
from our customers are very positive, which will further strengthen our position in Croatia.
I hope that these examples were able to provide some insight into how we work to make
Baloise better; or in other words, that Baloise 2012 is a very vibrant and realistic program,
as the examples hopefully demonstrate.
I am personally very much in favor of regularly reporting to you on our progress in
implementing Baloise 2012, as well as we are all at Baloise, from a content perspective, as
has just been done, and from an impact perspective. Details regarding impact can be
found on slide 29.

FINAL

Where are we in relation to our target of end proﬁt to the tune of CHF200 million by
2012? In 2010, we improved our results by CHF92 million. We therefore exceeded our
own target of between CHF55 million to CHF70 million for 2010 signiﬁcantly.
This additional CHF92 million resulted -- and you can see this below, on the left, from the
impact of optimization initiatives. In 2010, measures to increase eﬃciency had a major
impact in Switzerland and Belgium. We did not solely focus on cost, but also improved
our claims handling processes further. Included in the CHF92 million contributions is also
a one-eﬀect, stemming from the unwinding of companies in Germany.
These positive eﬀects from optimization initiatives have been complemented by
investment in growth. We expanded our sales capacity in our existing markets, for
instance, Austria, Croatia and Belgium. Certainly, the most high proﬁle new growth
segment is our new subsidiary, Baloise Life, which, as a start up, requires initial
investment, but which is already making a major contribution to growth.

Bloomberg Transcript

In terms of implementing Baloise 2012, we are right on target. Therefore, in 2011, we
anticipate that this program will generate a positive eﬀect of between CHF100 million and
CHF120 million. In 2012, we will feel the full beneﬁt of this program. By then, Baloise
sustainable earning power will have increased by CHF200 million per annum.
To conclude, I would like to take you through our outlook for the future, on slide 30. Our
ambitions remain unchanged. Over the cycle, we are aiming for a 15% return on equity.
We are looking to steadily increase earnings per share, and keep our combined ratio well
below 100. The 2010 annual result demonstrates that we are on track to achieve these
ambitious targets. I would like to summarize the most important key issues, once more.
Firstly, we achieved substantial growth; in most markets, we increased our market share.
Secondly, we have high earning power, and aim to enhance it further, with the aid of
Baloise 2012. The proposed dividend and payout ratio are very high. Thirdly, our balance
sheet is strong. Therefore, we are in optimum position to become of Europe's most
proﬁtable and fastest growing insurer.
Many thanks for being so attentive. And now, we would be pleased to answer your
questions. And for the question and answer round, I also welcome now Jan De Meulder,
who is the Head of our International business.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Three questions. On the solvency, I saw the very good number on Solvency I. Could you
give us an indication where you lie in terms of Swiss solvency test?

On the tax rate, I noticed that had come down quite a bit, or a little bit. And I just
wondered whether you could give us a feel for where you would see it, going forward,
because you now have quite a number of operations internationally?

FINAL

Then in terms of the payout, so last year was 70% and this year 57%, with the buyback
dying down. What should we be penciling in for a normal payout, going forward, if there
is no buyback? Thank you very much.

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

Thank you, Mr. Huttner, for the questions. I will hand over the ﬁrst two to German Egloﬀ,
and then come back to the payout question; German?

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Well the ﬁrst one is news on the SST quota, not too surprisingly, is that we are in a green
zone. That's about the information we can give at the moment.

Bloomberg Transcript

As on the tax rate -- well, I can give further information. We are, of course, still further in
contact with the regulators, as all our competitors are. And well, I guess that we will there
come to a clariﬁcation in those points that are still open. But in fact, we have to feed in the
ﬁgures at the end of the April, so at the moment, that's not priority.
As for the tax rate, you said the tax rate is lower. Actually, the opposite is right, it is higher.
But the reason was the previous year, we had an extra eﬀect in Belgium of about CHF30
million. So that kept it up. Nevertheless, you're right that, in the long-term average, it is
still quite low. So I would expect that it is probably normally somewhere in between 24%
and 26%, or so.

A - Martin Strobel

Now coming back here to your question regarding a payout. First of all, I'd like to
remember that we have an oﬃcially written down payout policy that says that one-third of
the annual results should be given to the shareholders.
Actually, for the last years, we exceed this policy, and we are really aiming for keeping our
payout at a high end reliable level. We want to be regarded as a company who has a high
end reliable payout. So this means we are really proud that we stick to the high CHF4.50,
and together with the share buyback, this leads to a total payout of 59%.
We have a dividend yield with this dividend of 4.9%, which makes us I think one of the
best insurance titles in the Swiss or Central Western Europe universe. And we will stick at
least to this policy to be really the high end reliable payback and payout company.

Q - Michael Klien

{BIO 4262408 <GO>}

I had three questions. Firstly on OZ, Osiguranje Zagreb, I see that you haven't impaired
the goodwill for that which I think is about CHF70 million. Looking at the numbers at the
moment in Croatia and Serbia, somewhat disappointingly I've got a top line being
negative; I've got proﬁts, well, losses being generated. You lost a banking distribution
partner, so could you help explain what was the decision why you think that there's no
impairment needed for this goodwill.
Secondly, on the buyback front, now you aim to ﬁnish the current buyback by the end of
April, no new buyback plan. What are you planning to do with the shares you have
bought under the current buyback program?
And ﬁnally, if I understood correctly on the eﬃciency improvement program, you said that
you improved proﬁt by CHF92 million, but if I have understood correctly you said that
there were some one-oﬀ eﬀects -- positive one-oﬀ eﬀects from Germany included in the
CHF92 million, could you maybe elaborate and also give us a ﬁgure on how much this
positive one-oﬀ eﬀect was?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Mr. Klien. I will give the two ﬁrst questions to German Egloﬀ to
answer, and I will personally then answer the third one. German, may I ask you to --

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Okay. OZ goodwill, as you know, you're not entirely free whether you would like to writeoﬀ goodwill or not. The question is really whether the model you have in place is
triggering an impact or is hitting an impairment trigger or not; so, in fact, in Croatia it has
not.
You're right that the top-line came down as for the whole market. But be careful, there is
also a currency eﬀect in that, because in Croatia we are cooperating in kuna, which is even
a bit lower than euro, and euro was low into Swiss francs already.
In fact, we still think the business case is in place. And obviously, the auditor thinks the
same, because, as I said, you are not free what you are doing with the goodwill, so you
have to do an impairment test, which is predeﬁned and you can't just change your
parameters every year, and then the auditor is looking at that and agrees or not.
Of course, you're right; Croatia is in a diﬃcult economic situation. If that keeps on going
like this for the next ﬁve years, we will probably have a diﬀerent situation. But as for now,
mid-term we still believe that these economies will grow and will become proﬁtable.

FINAL

The eﬃciency progress that Croatia has made is extremely positive in fact. But due to their
recessionary environment and the low growth of the market, of course, this was kept oﬀ.
But in fact, the business as such the basis of the business is a lot more solid than it was in
the past. This for OZ.
Then the bought back shares, currently we use them to cover the outstanding convertible,
which has its maturity in 2016, and then we will see what we do with it, because, as you
know, it needs a second transaction to convert these shares into cancellation or
whatsoever.

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

Then I'd like to come to the last question; Mr. Klien, you asked, what's the one-time eﬀect
in Baloise 2012 coming from Germany? This eﬀect is around CHF15 million. And this is a
one-oﬀ payment received from Signal Iduna since they received in the process of
unwinding 40% of our sales force in Hamburg. And we received this payment to be able
to invest in new sales capacity in Germany.

Bloomberg Transcript

So this means we see a positive one-time eﬀect in Germany this year. The investment in
Germany, investment in sales force, but also investment in the integration write-down in
terms of IT investments, and then all these topics; they will show up very much in the
result this year. In Germany now we have cleared up everything with the unions, with all
the regulators, so now we are really in the process of doing the unwinding integration
physically, and here some investments will be needed in 2011.
So even if you take out the CHF15 million out of the CHF92 million, we still exceed the
upper limit, or the upper target we set ourselves of CHF70 million, so this means even
including this CHF15 million, Baloise 2012 is progressing better actually than expected,
which is very good news from my point of view. And I think it's again very important from
our point of view that the eﬀect of B2012 are sustainable, really investing in making
Baloise better and are progressing quite well.

{BIO 7284728 <GO>}

I've got three questions please. On slide I guess it was 14, your Asset Management
volatility, you mentioned that you purchased further swaptions here to protect the interest
rate; I guess it was in 2010, so what was please the P&L eﬀect of these swaptions in 201?
The second question is on your Life business. You mentioned that you gained strong
growth in variable annuity business, especially in Switzerland, could you please give a bit
more details on your new business mix in Life; how much is traditional business? How
much is normal or unit linked, or variable annuity business? And do you have something
like target ranges for the diﬀerent products?

And the third question is very short on reserve releases, I think still 4% in 2010, so still
pretty high, what can we expect here for the future? Is this level coming a bit down in
future years? Thank you very much.

FINAL

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

Thank you very much Mr. Noack, I will hand over the question on the interest rate eﬀect or
the swaption eﬀect in the P&L to Martin Wenk our Chief Investment Oﬃcer. I will
personally answer the new business mix question, and then I will hand over the reserves
in Nonlife to German Egloﬀ. Martin, may I ask you to give some details on the swaptions?

A - Martin Wenk

{BIO 4193573 <GO>}

Okay, you are perfectly right about the swaption program being eﬀective in the P&L, as
opposed to the movement of the underlying bond, so there is a discrepancy in that. We
saw a very positive eﬀect in the ﬁrst half-year that turned then in a negative in the second
half-year, and the bottom line for the full year was a slight positive eﬀect. I wouldn't have
the exact ﬁgure right here, I can give that to you later, but it was quite a minor eﬀect in
that, and you have some more information on page 117 in the ﬁnancial report. You could
look it up there.

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Then I will come back Mr. Noack to the question on the new business mix. We disclosed
today also the report on the market (inaudible) and there we have a lot of information on
obviously the new business and also let's say a breakdown what is classical business and
what's unit linked business.
And I think if we look at Baloise Group as a total, and look at the APE, so what's the new
business generated, then it's about more than 50% of the new business is unit linked, and
this is due to our strategy that we want to shift away from the classical Life business, more
towards a better mix in the new business of unit linked and traditional business. I think
54% or above 50%, actually I think it's 54%, it's quite good as a mix or as an indication of
how we would proceed going forward.
Now coming to the reserves in Nonlife, German?

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Yes. Well perfectly reserved. IFRS tells you that you should reserve (inaudible) that means
there are no prior year proﬁts at all. But of course, the reality is a bit diﬀerent, especially so
if your portfolio continuously improves over the years. And I think that really makes the
diﬀerence.
Now, we made an analysis what is to expect and within the last couple of years we were in
average at about 3% combined ratio, of the combined ratio point or CHF18 million that
was about the average; with one exceptionally year 2005 when we had to strengthen
reserves, especially in Switzerland, for the whiplash cases. But in fact, I guess, yes, you

Page 15 of 33

could assume, or our expectation would be some 3% combined ratio points is
appropriate for the next couple of years to come.

Perfect, thank you very much.

Christopher Hitchings, KBW.

Q - Christopher Hitchings

{BIO 2034501 <GO>}

A couple of things. Can you just remind me how much more of your existing share
buyback program has to be done, I've got slightly confused as to CHF50 millions here
and CHF50 millions there. It's a technical thing.
More interestingly, I think, is you talked a little bit about CHF50 million negative in the Life
result in the ﬁrst half from the change in liability duration, was any of that reversed in the
second half? And I think there's also been a slightly exceptional element from the change
in annuity bonuses and again can you give us some help as to whether that was one oﬀ,
or ongoing?

Bloomberg Transcript

Thirdly, I know they're relatively small ﬁgures but I'm surprised at the signiﬁcant
improvement in new business margins in Germany and Belgium, and I wondered what's
behind that.
And ﬁnally, can you just help us a little bit more about the management change you
announced this morning as well in the background to that? Thank you.

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

Chris, thanks a lot for your questions. I think the ﬁrst two, the share buyback and the
interest vector and bonus topics in Life, I think can be answered by German. I will give you
some details on the new business margin and the management change.

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Yes indeed. Actually with the current share buyback program we will follow that or
continue that until there is still some shares are remaining from the last program. So we'll
actually continue until we have exactly the number we need to cover the convertible
which is outstanding. So that means it's about 80,000 shares which will be bought during
the next couple of weeks until end of April. So it's only 0.2%, so we are almost done there.
About the interest movement and so on in the ﬁrst half and the second half in Switzerland
and the surplus, the bonus costs, all in all, I can just summarize it, because it's extremely
complicated. Because for the ﬁrst time currency have actually contaminated this interest
rate factor thing as well, because, of course, the ongoing income has changed. And
because there is as well an estimate for the long term development of the interest rate in
Page 16 of 33



Company Name: Baloise Holding AG
Company Ticker: BALN SW Equity
Date: 2011-03-22

that ﬁgure and the euro crisis just started in the second half. So even though, let's say, 10
year interest rates have risen, the prospect for the very long term interest rates are not
better than they have been in the ﬁrst half.

FINAL

So to summarize that, I would say interest rates and currency eﬀects were a bit bigger
than the positive were a bit bigger than the positive inﬂuence of the surplus bonus costs.
In fact, I would say the result -- the net result of that is probably minus CHF20 million.

Q - Christopher Hitchings

{BIO 2034501 <GO>}

Is that for the year or for the second half?

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

For the year; for the year.

Q - Christopher Hitchings

{BIO 2034501 <GO>}

So there's a CHF30 million positive in the second half?

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

No, no, wrong. It's not for the year. It's for the second half actually.

Q - Christopher Hitchings

{BIO 2034501 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So minus CHF20 million for the second half.

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Wait a minute. I clarify that, Martin's answering the other questions.

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

So while German is looking up the details regarding the interest rate structure and
relation to the bonus adjustment, Chris, I'd like to answer you further questions.
One was the development -- cost development of the new business margin in Germany
and Belgium. And here we work heavily in the entire Group to improve the proﬁtability of
our Life business.
As you might know, due to our -- in the history of Baloise we focus a lot of improving the
Non-Life. And we keep on doing so since we know that the combined ratio performance
is one of the key performance drivers. But now, with the start of B2012 we focus also a lot
on the Life business.
So what have been the main drivers to increase the new business margin in these
countries? Growth -- growth helps a lot. If you had a stronger growth, this has the very
positive eﬀect on the margins. Then you see a substantial cost eﬀect also in new business

Page 17 of 33



Company Name: Baloise Holding AG
Company Ticker: BALN SW Equity
Date: 2011-03-22

margins, since costs are going down, and this widens, let's say, the margins going
forward.

FINAL

Especially in Germany, we adjusted the shareholder split substantially. This was one of the
things we aimed for when doing the unwinding in Hamburg. Now we have full control of
our operations in Hamburg. One eﬀect of this full control is that we really now can adjust
the shareholder split according to the policy of Baloise Group.
A fourth factor is a product design/product mix we apply in our MCEV based proﬁt tests
to all new business in our major operations. And here we are much preciser in terms of
what should be the guarantee level given to the customer, what type of guarantee should
be given to the customers, resulting in a lower, let's say, time value of option and
guarantees for the new business.
And the last factor, it's more a technical point. We apply now in the MCEV also a liquidity
premium, being consistent with all the EDC assumptions. And this again also has a
positive eﬀect on the new business margin.

Bloomberg Transcript

So these are the major drivers; how we try to improve the quality of the new Life business.
Now coming to your last question, then I will hand you back over to German. The
management change, we disclosed today that Olav Noack will no longer be the CEO of
the Swiss business, the reason being diﬀerent opinions in the area of leadership. Put
diﬀerently, the reason is not that we are not happy with the development of Switzerland,
or the strategy of Switzerland, or the results of Switzerland. As you might see, the results
of Switzerland are good, and are quite convincing.
I'm very happy that we have really found a very good internal person to lead now the
Swiss business. It's Michael Mueller, who has -- with Baloise now for 14 years. He has
worked in the Holding for some time, now for two years in the Swiss business, and takes
over the business immediately. And he will pursue actually the same strategy in the Swiss
business as before, so I don't expect any major changes to our strategy or direction. I
think it was more a question on the leadership topic that led to this management
decision.
I would now like to hand you back to German on the question of the interest structure.

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

You were perfectly right. Sorry, I was a bit confused, because I got non-verbal signals here
that were a bit confusing. So minus CHF20 million, and you had the CHF55 million in the
ﬁrst half, so that means plus CHF30 million more or less in the second half. So perfect.

Q - Christopher Hitchings

{BIO 2034501 <GO>}

And that plus CHF30 million can be regarded as an exceptional proﬁt can it, if we are
looking going forward?

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Yes, because it was, well, negatively impacted by interest rates and currencies, positively
impacted by the -- because of the surpluses. So it was, in both sides, an extra eﬀect if you
like.

One question on the hedging of your foreign exchange exposure. You have CHF430
million net euro exposure and CHF500[ph] million net US dollar. You indicated that was
hedged up to 80% -- or 60% to 80% by the end of the year. Can you give us an update
today, and your plans on this?

Bloomberg Transcript

Then the second question on interest rates and activities. You give a nice overview on
slide 35 on a lower yield curve. Can you maybe give us some indication if the yield curve
goes up 100 basis points as well, and the IFRS result impact?
And maybe the last one on M&A; you increased your market share in Belgium by
acquisitions. Can we expect further maybe moves, and should we expect that you will do
that on own ﬁnancing, own funding, as well?

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

Thank you very much Stefan Schuermann. I will hand the question -- hedging question
over to Martin Wenk to give you the actual status. Then the plus on the 100 basis points
yield I will ask German to give an indication. And I will personally then answer the M&A
question. Martin, may I ask you to give the answer to the hedging?

A - Martin Wenk

{BIO 4193573 <GO>}

We have had very high hedge ratio during last year, also even the highest at the end of
the year. We have released a little bit of that hedge ratio in the beginning of this year in
regard to the euro. What we have done thereafter is we have increased our hedge ratio
for the US dollar in the aftermath now of the events in Japan, because we are believing in
the fact that the Japanese people will repatriate a lot of their money into Japan.
And the actual hedge ratio as per yesterday was -- in the euro was 87% and in the US
dollar it was 85%, while for the Life business it was 95% and for the Nonlife it was about
70%. So that's across the businesses, the hedge ratios.

FINAL

Well sensitivities, I would refer to the MCEV report on page 15. So the IFRS sensitivities are
accordingly.

Q - Stefan Schuermann

{BIO 3235442 <GO>}

Okay. And maybe on these -- they are still quite high. Are you working to bring them
down, or what will you expect here?

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Well one possibility of an answer is that we can actually aﬀord it, to have a bit higher
sensitivity on interest rates. That, of course, opens opportunities as well; it's not only
negative.
Of course, if you're less sensitive there, it has advantages if interest rates are going down,
but it has huge disadvantages if it's going up. So currently we are at quite -- obviously
down, or --

{BIO 3235442 <GO>}

That's helpful, yes, thanks.

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

And now talking about the M&A. First, our policy remains unchanged. We are -- ﬁrst of all,
we are looking at an organic development of the Group, since I think this is, let's say, the
best risk return, also from a shareholder perspective.
Secondly, in our core markets we are looking for bolt-on acquisitions, and we're very
happy that we were able to invest and ﬁnd targets -- appropriate targets that did meet our
hurdles, in Belgium and Luxembourg.
Going forward, can you expect from Baloise do such things again? The answer is yes, as
soon as we ﬁnd further targets that meet our criteria, since we have a very good balance
sheet, we have a good earnings dynamic, we can really aﬀord to invest further, also in
inorganic steps. They will be in our core markets, in our existing markets. They will be
bolt-ons; that's the type of transaction you might see, going forward.

Talking about how to ﬁnance these, we always look at all, let's say, how do we ﬁnance?
And I think it is more, let's say, we have a normal reﬁnancing mode; maybe German can
give you some details here. And I think we will reﬁnance these transactions as we have
done in the past. So I think no real surprises from Baloise regarding these decisions.

FINAL

Maybe, German, on the ﬁnancing side?

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Nothing really new there, except for, as you know, there is now a hybrid market in Swiss
francs as well, where you can go for smaller portions than in the past. So this is certainly
another instrument which you should look at, especially so in a solvency environment.
That is progressively developing. Solvency II, we don't really know what's coming there,
and so we'll certainly look at diﬀerent kinds of capital.
But in fact, nothing spectacular; I would say just really the new thing is that hybrid in Swiss
francs is a possibility now, and it wasn't a couple of years ago. And you might remember
that when everybody was trying to talk us into a hybrid -- an issue of a hybrid bond, we
resisted. I think nowadays it's probably more attractive, especially in this interest rate
environment. But we will talk to that if we come to it.

Okay, yes, thank you.

Operator
Fabrizio Croce, Kepler Capital Markets.

Q - Fabrizio Croce

{BIO 15005585 <GO>}

Three questions please. The ﬁrst one is on cross-border business. If I look to the growth
that you are having on this business I saw actually a nice increase, which pleased me. But
still the operation is unproﬁtable. Even if there is a lot of volume around it's the third
largest operation, the other segment. I see that the EBIT loss is of minus CHF17 million. So
the question here is, when will this operation be breakeven, if at all, or are you looking to
close it down?
Second question is about the return on equity. The return on equity of 15% over the cycle
seems a little bit challenging considering that the past two years you had some 10%
return. Then I understand, of course, the current macro-economic environment, recession
related claims, but the point is here, how much realized capital gain do you need actually
to allow us to see the 15%? And is this target still realistic if we keep current environment
for up to 10 years, for instance?
And the third question is about Bank SoBa. Bank SoBa is one of the reason because you
are not reaching the 15%, because it's yielding some 7% return on equity, diluting actually
the Group return on equity.

Page 21 of 33



Company Name: Baloise Holding AG
Company Ticker: BALN SW Equity
Date: 2011-03-22

So I don't know if SoBa is a drag to Baloise, or Baloise is a drag to SoBa, but the fact is
that the other Cantonal Banks are yielding around 9%, 10%, so something is going not in a
proper direction here.

FINAL

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

Thank you very much for your questions. I suggest that Jan De Meulder, who joined us for
the Q&A session, is going to answer your question on the cross-border business, and I will
answer your question on the return on equity and the Bank SoBa. Jan?

A - Jan De Meulder

{BIO 15407344 <GO>}

Thank you. Cross-border business we have in Luxembourg, and we have in Lichtenstein,
and you have two streams. One is the unit linked REPA[ph] business, which we have in
Luxembourg and Lichtenstein, and which now has reached a sizeable volume. We have
about CHF5 billion assets under management, and that activity in itself is proﬁtable.
The other part is the new products, the VA[ph], which we started in Lichtenstein in 2008,
we went into the market. And as you know, a start up in Life always takes time to get
break-even, and we are very happy with the volumes that we realized here. We are not
breakeven yet, but expect that to come in 2012/2013, at the latest.

Bloomberg Transcript

Of course, with the low interest rate environment last year, the margin suﬀered a bit on
the Swiss business, but nevertheless, we are very conﬁdent that we will reach break even
soon, and very soon for our new start-up also in Lichtenstein.

Q - Fabrizio Croce

{BIO 15005585 <GO>}

So you are still convinced of this business in that sense. I understand it that you're not
closing down?

A - Jan De Meulder

{BIO 15407344 <GO>}

Absolutely. We're convinced and we are really driving it forward. We -- VA we have in
Switzerland, to a large extent, but we are also starting it up in Belgium and Austria. Other
markets will follow. And the cross-border life unit linked business is a growing market. We
are convinced also in other countries there are opportunities. We are looking at other
countries.
We have been very successful this year in Italy. Although the Scudo Fiscale ended in April,
we still wrote and write business in Italy. Also, in Belgium we have considerable volumes.
And now that the legal situation in Germany is clear, also there we see the business
picking up. So we're really committed to drive the business forward.

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

Mr. Croce, I'd like to come to your second question regarding the RoE. I just can repeat
we stick to our ambition of the RoE of 15% over the cycle. I know, and I think you're
reasoning is right, that this is really quite ambitious since we are faced now with a very low

Page 22 of 33

FINAL

interest environment. We are faced with a low euro. These are substantial macro eﬀects
for our proﬁt and loss statement. But we stick to our ambition, since we are convinced as
soon as we will see normal interest rates and normal world in exchange rate, our earning
power will increase substantially.
We talked before about the sensitivities, for instance in the Life book, and you can see
them from a negative or from a positive point of view, we're looking at them from a
positive point of view, in case that interest rates go up, you will see a substantial increase
in value for Baloise Life book. And this is substantial and will really aﬀect positively the
earnings side.
And in calculating these targets, we're not factoring in, let's say, capital releases or
something. This is -- we're aiming for a sustainable business model, so that's what we're
aiming for and we won't change the 15%, although we know and we accept this, it's very
demanding at the given environment. But we really like, as an attitude, to be ambitious
and to really improve Baloise. One very important factor is our Baloise 2012 program;
that's progressing well and will help us to improve Baloise further.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now coming to your third question, talking about Baloise Bank SoBa, ﬁrst of all a technical
point, the RoE that we disclose is a -- is local GAAP, so the IFRS calculation, the internal
one, might look a bit better.
The second point here is, yes, the local RoE that we disclose, and you ﬁnd more details on
slide 62 in our presentation that's in the back of materials, the proﬁt and loss statement of
SoBa. We disclose a further information -- additional information. So what's the added
value to the insurance by the joint business model of the focused ﬁnancial services
provider? As you see here on page 62 in the second line from the bottom that this added
RoE. So including the contribution from the insurance side is 11.4%, so this is higher than
the RoE of Baloise Group; meaning, the model adds value to Baloise Group.
So I think this shed some light on the integration of the two business models in the
environment where it's not so easy to sell individual life -- life insurances, due to the low
interest environment. We are quite happy to have the Bank as a integral part of our
business model, since we can oﬀer saving products to our customers, so the money sticks
within Baloise. We have the highest reinvestment quota in the market; it's still around
40%. So this means 40% of maturing life business in Switzerland is reinvested in Baloise
products, be it life insurances or be it saving products with the Bank.
So I think really the model has shown very well that it works, but, Mr. Croce, you are right,
we are really aiming for further improving the Bank. You might have seen that the cost
income ratio is -- has come down, due to our investment in the IT platform, and that's not
the end. We will go forward in further improving SoBa.

Sorry, I have a follow-up on the RoE 15%. If no capital release are oﬀset in the -- actually in
the 15% RoE target, by how much should interest rates go up; that's a humungous ﬁgure.

Yes, I think, for -- we -- talking about this question, let's say, what's the average interest
rate you have seen over the last 20 years in Switzerland, I think that should be a level that
what we regard as normal. And if you talk about this, then you see that we're quite in a
low interest environment, and far from being in normal times.
And I'd like to remember, in '07 for instance, we had this RoE of 15%, so it's not we have
never reached it. We have reached it in '06, '07. We did not in the last years, due to some
substantial macro eﬀects, but I think the business model is geared towards, over the cycle,
having really a very nice proﬁtability.

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

If I might add it's not that we assume absolutely no capital releases. We assume an
average return on shares of 7.5%. So that means dividend yield and the diﬀerence can be
done by capital releases, but no extra releases.

Q - Farquhar Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Two, hopefully, quite brief questions around the combined ratio. Firstly, if we just focus on
the adjusted loss ratio of 63.8% in the full year, that's deteriorated about 1.1percentage
points year on year, and compares to about 59%/60% in the ﬁrst half. And I wonder if you
could just give us some color around what happened there, particularly in the second
half.
Then looking forward, I wonder if you could just give us some color around where tariﬀs
and claims' inﬂation are at the moment, and where you expect those might go through
2011. Thanks.

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

I will answer these questions from a market perspective. First of all, we disclosed a
adjustment for the claims above CHF4 million, and German Egloﬀ already gave these
ﬁgures; normally we expect CHF45 million and then have seen CHF84 million, so a higher
claims' load.
Actually, what you don't see in the ﬁgures, we also had a higher claims load on the large
claims, a little below the CHF4 million. So this 1 point loss increase -- or increase on the
loss ratio you have seen, is largely due to a really major -- major claims, not only above
CHF4 million, but also below CHF4 million, let's say, CHF3.8 million, CHF3.7 million, and
so on, and so on and so on.

FINAL

The normal claims' ratios we don't see a diﬃcult picture. So the impression looking at the
books in the markets we operate is -- on is that we are still have a very good claims'
frequency in the major books, so no adverse development. So I think that's important
here.
If you see -- if you talk about tariﬀs, my impression, talking to my colleagues in the markets
is that we have seen the lows in the market. And in some selective cases, we have already
been able to increase new rates. For instance, this is true for the car business in
Switzerland; this is true for some of the businesses in Germany, some of the businesses in
Belgium. But it's too early to really say we will see substantial increase in tariﬀs, but I think
the movement is now going up and not going down any more.
My impression is that also the development now in Japan, from the really large claims'
load that the reinsurance companies face, might help, but it's a might; I don't know. But I
expect actually that we will see, as a secondary eﬀect, also the increase of reinsurance
premiums and that would really start, let's say, the next cycle. As you might know, the
pricing cycle insurance business is, in many cases, driven by the reinsurance pricing cycle.

Bloomberg Transcript

Claims' inﬂation, we don't see anything particular right. Claims' inﬂation is within our
normal ranges and the normal assumptions we have also on our proﬁt and loss statement
and the balance sheet, and we don't see really big, let's say, changes in the inﬂation itself.
What we expect going forward is a further improvement. With Baloise 2012, we work on
the claims' processes to further improve also the -- let's say, the claims' quota, and we will
see further eﬀects here coming from Baloise 2012.

Q - Farquhar Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Thanks for that. Just one follow-up, if we took the CHF4 million large claim down to say,
CHF3 million large claim. Do you have any sense of what the impact of that number
one[ph] is?

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

I will hand you over to German, who is good at giving such (inaudible).

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Well I couldn't tell you, but it would make a lot more. So if you actually compare the ﬁrst
half and the second half, one -- I can tell you two reasons that make a diﬀerence.
The ﬁrst one is that we had some extra gains out of previous years in Belgium in the ﬁrst
half, so actually that, of course, didn't repeat in the second half. So that means if you have
an extra CHF2 million in the ﬁrst half, but nothing in the second half, so you're loss ratio
becames -- becomes worse. And the second eﬀect is that we had quite substantial large
losses in the second half, which were not triggering the retention rate of the reinsurance,
so that means the gap between gross and net widened actually in the second half.

Page 25 of 33



Company Name: Baloise Holding AG

But you're right, there were quite an amount of cases, so in the magnitude of CHF2
million to CHF4 million. I couldn't give you an amount, but it was -- I think it was
substantial. So therefore, that really triggered the -- it could be CHF20 million, I don't
know.

Mr. Michael Haid, CA Cheuvreux.

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

Just coming back to this before -- to the combined ratio before reinsurance and net of
reinsurance. The gap is round about 3percentage points. It seems that you cede attractive
proﬁts to the reinsurers. How is this gap explained? You just mentioned one eﬀect could
be large losses, which did not hit the reinsurance cover. And do you expect this to -- this
gap to come down or to close in 2011 and 2012?

Bloomberg Transcript

And second question, a standard question these days; yields on the investment, you
increased the duration of the ﬁxed income portfolio in Life and you realized some capital
gains in Nonlife, where you probably reinvest at lower rates. So where do you see the
running yields, both in Life and Nonlife in 2011 and 2012?

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

Thank you. I will hand you over for the ﬁrst question to German Egloﬀ and the second to
Martin Wenk; German?

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Well ﬁrstly, we are buying reinsurance really for catastrophes, so it's -- they are Excel[ph]
contracts, which are really covering bad cases. This year, we had the problem -- or, the
problem just as it happened. Apart from Xinthia, there were no natural disasters, so they
were really single cases; that's one reason. And in those cases that's quite cleared up the
gap -- the reinsurance doesn't help you a lot.
Second reason is that couple of years ago, when we started with the ﬁrst share buyback
program, some of the investors said, well, can't you actually use your capital for your core
business. And there we increased the retention rate in reinsurance, which made from a
risk-return point of view, lot of sense and I think it still does. But of course, you can, in a
year that just belongs to the business, run into a claims' structure where you're ahead[ph],
but not really, so reinsurance just isn't triggered.
And the third eﬀect, which is quite important, is we are still being part, and are managing,
couple of captives for big corporations and that means we have a natural gap, which is
quite substantial as well. We did as well -- but that was just ﬁnished now, we did as well
Page 26 of 33

some fronting business from -- for companies which were not operating in Europe, but
had, for their international programs, to have local coverage. So that creates a natural
gap, but this is -- you can't really close it, because if somebody tells you he is earning
money with his reinsurer over the years, then he's just lying.

FINAL

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Martin Wenk

{BIO 4193573 <GO>}

Regarding the investment yield, I can tell you that you have some details of that on page
43 in the backup of the slides, where you see the direct yield and the guarantees actually
we have, and you see there that the yields came back 0.1% over the year.
Now I have to remind you that 2010 was a very special year in this regard. We had a low in
the 10-year government bond in Switzerland of 1.0%. We are, right now, again, at much
higher rate of about 1.8%. So I think it was quite exceptional over the last year.
On the other hand, it is still the case that the bonds coming due have a higher coupon
than the ones we can buy right now. And that means that, if interest rates are not going up
this year, we will have another drawback of, probably, about 0.1%. But as I said, it depends
heavily on the development of the interest rates this year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

And that goes for the Life business?

A - Martin Wenk

{BIO 4193573 <GO>}

That goes basically for both. Of course, we have a shorter duration in Nonlife. And we will
be able to reinvest more swiftly in the Nonlife business because of the short duration. But
the bonds maturing have approximately the same coupon yield, so it goes for both.

{BIO 3214668 <GO>}

Just a follow up on the question on the business of the claims ratio; if I've missed some
information I apologize. But one of the things the previous questioner was asking about
was the underlying claims ratio, because, in the response, you mentioned a couple of
things about PYDs and large claims, and so on. But if one, very simplistically, splits the
business half and half between H1 and H2, you basically got a claims ratio just under 60%

Page 27 of 33



Company Name: Baloise Holding AG
Company Ticker: BALN SW Equity
Date: 2011-03-22

for H1, something around nearly 64% for the year, suggesting something like an adjusted
loss ratio of 68% for H2.

FINAL

I'm just wondering, is that a normal seasonality? Is that all explained by these 2 million to
3 million claims? Or is there something else going on there that we should be aware of,
and that might carry through into the future?

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

No. I would say that's a normal seasonality. It depends as well as like the calendar days
are hit by, let's say, weather diversity. Normally H2 is a bit bigger -- you have more losses
in H2, than in H1. That mainly comes from the hail season in Switzerland. Now we had
about two or three hail storms in Switzerland, but just smaller ones. Not really big ones.
So in fact, of course, they have cost us a couple of million as well. But they have not been
so huge that, as I mentioned before, that re-insurance was triggered or so.
But currently what we see, and from the analysis, I would say that's normal volatility you
have due to weather, and due to portfolio mix as well; because you might have a bit more
property, a bit more liability, so that changes as well, but quite normal.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

If I could just follow up actually on that last question, speciﬁcally looking at Belgium.
There, I think, the claims ratio in the second half of the year, I reckon, was about 75%,
against a normal run rate of about 60% in both halves of the year, if I'm not very mistaken.
So I was wondering if you could just comment a little bit more on that?
And also in Belgium on the expense ratio, the cost ratio, which ticked up a bit since the
half year, I was wondering whether there's anything in preparation for your acquisitions,
or anything else that you'd like to highlight on that?

And that was exactly those reserves -- gains on reserves that I mentioned a couple of
questions before, in Belgium, and that was in the ﬁrst half; that was one of the reasons.
And of course, it wasn't repeated in the second half. That was --

FINAL

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

No, so the implied loss ratio, in the second half, was, therefore, 75%, which is much higher
than your normal run rate.

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

No, no, I would say the second half. It's just, of course, it's on a lower volume in the ﬁrst
half. You have just half of the premium. So you can't just take the average of the two; it
wouldn't work.
In the ﬁrst half it was, I think the extra gains was, about CHF25 million/CHF30 million
something, but, of course, measured just with the half-year premium. So that's why the
eﬀect on the claims ratio was relatively huge in the half-year. But in the full year, half of it
was then weared[ph] out, let's say.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Okay, it still seems seasonally quite high in the second half, but okay. And was there
anything on the expense side or?

I mean there was, in the second half, in Belgium. What we had there was this ﬂood in -where was it, somewhere in Flanders. It was not huge but, nevertheless, a couple of

Just a couple of questions, ﬁrstly in terms of cost savings. I just want to know as in the
remaining cost savings, how does that split between Life and Nonlife?
Secondly, in terms of your MCEV report, if you could give a breakdown in terms of how
much is free surplus, and how much is required capital from the SA[ph]? And if you could
say something on the gross strain, where that is? The net strain was about CHF40 million
last year. Thanks.

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

FINAL

I will give you some details on the Life and Nonlife split. Then I will ask German Egloﬀ to
talk about the split on the required capital and the free surplus; and the second question
on the MCEV.
Life/Nonlife, in general one can say that if you take these CHF200 million as the total
eﬀect of Baloise 2012, then split between Nonlife and Life this is about 20% for Life, and
80% to Nonlife. How come? As you know, in the Life business, if you improve the business
then it's a lot of -- it's eaten up, so to say, by, for instance, legal quote mechanisms and
shareholder -- or policyholder participation.
So this means, I think it's a general ball-park, between the 80%/20%, or 70%/30% would
be a good split to make a split between Life and Nonlife of Baloise 2012 eﬀects.
If you talk of improving the Life business in terms of Baloise 2012, please take into account
that some of the improvements we make to Life might not appear in the Life portion of
the Life segment of our proﬁt and loss statements. You will see some of the eﬀects in the
Banking division.

Bloomberg Transcript

For instance, if we improve the fee structure of the Asset Management, let's say, from a
look-through perspective, that's an improvement of the Life book. But in our proﬁt and
loss statement under IFRS deposit eﬀects show up in the Banking segment. So that's a
technical detail on where to ﬁnd the improvements of the Life business.
Now I'd like to hand you over for the MCEV split of the required capital.

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Well the free surplus, unfortunately I have to stick to my answer I gave you a couple of
weeks ago. I think, in the current environment, especially so until we don't really know
what that kind of Swiss Solvency and Solvency II models are established, it doesn't make
sense to make that split, because it might well be that I have to remodel it within a couple
of weeks, and I wouldn't run that risk. So currently, I'm sorry, but I'm not able to publish
that.
But of course, that doesn't really help you. But you could just make an educated guess.
Other people, or other companies, show SoBa[ph] I ﬁgure, and this doesn't make sense
to us. But as for the moment, we have to stay with that.
Now the third question about gross net strain in the MCEV. The business strain is actually
the deferred acquisition cost. You see on page seven of the report, you see the CHF40
million in the shareholders' net assets. And of course, there is no split between
policyholder and shareholder here as well, free surplus and required capital.

Q - Dhruv Gahlaut

Q - Rene Locher

{BIO 1921075 <GO>}

Just on the acquisition of Nateus, I guess the Solvency I ratio of 224%, that's before the
acquisition. So perhaps you could give an indication where Solvency I stands after these
acquisition.
Then you mentioned before, German, that you would like to -- or you intend to tap the
hybrid market. So I was just wondering what amount you're targeting if then. That's the
ﬁrst question.
And the second one is on Baloise 2012, if I take a look at the chart on slide 29, well, I
understand that we've got one-oﬀ now in 2010, so that we end up with CHF92 million.
That explains a little bit ﬂattish achievements going into 2011, because Mr. Strobel
mentioned before that we have to do some investments in German sales. But then we see
a huge achievement in 2012. Perhaps you can just explain how you go from 2011 to 2012?

Bloomberg Transcript

And well, it might be a little bit of a stupid question, but if I take a look at on slide 13, there
you mentioned that Nonlife business duration reduced two bonds sales resulting in
realized gains. Then I go to page 15, I can see, in the Nonlife business, that you have
realized loss, including impairments on the ﬁxed interest securities of CHF41 million. So
perhaps Martin Wenk could just give me a little bit more insight here. Thanks.

A - Martin Strobel

{BIO 5296838 <GO>}

Thank you very much Mr. Locher. I will hand you over for the acquisition Solvency I eﬀect
to German Egloﬀ and also the Hybrid. I will answer the B2012 question personally, and
then I will hand you over to Martin Wenk; German?

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Well the ﬁrst one is, of course, a trap question. As long as, ﬁrstly, the purchasing price is
not ﬁxed yet. And secondly, it's not decided how to ﬁnance it, it is not possible to give
you an indication of the Solvency I as well, that's quite clear.
And I just said that hybrid is an option as well within, let's say, the ﬁnancing orchestra. I
didn't say I will tap the hybrid market and, of course, I wouldn't even say to what amount.
There are a couple more possibilities. You might as well ask, are you doing a loan in euro,
for example, because, obviously you have to pay Nateus in euro, and not in Swiss francs.
That would be a good question as well. And I wouldn't answer it either.

FINAL

Coming to the B2012 question, so how come there is a hockey stick at the end of the
program? Actually there are two main reasons why you see this type of hockey stick.
First of all, related to Baloise 2012 or interlinked Baloise 2012 are heavy investments. For
instance, to change the business model in Switzerland, called the Skephart[ph], it's an
internal project, we have to invest heavily in IT, and people training, and all the stuﬀ. And
you see the eﬀects, for instance, in 2010, a small part of capital is also into 2011. And the
full eﬀect, positive eﬀect, of this measure, without, let's say, investment, you see then in
2012. So that's one reason for this is the, let's say, investment dynamics of Baloise 2012.
Other reason for the hockey stick is that some substantial measures take longer time of
realization. I can give you two examples for this class of measures. One is Germany. In
Germany we start the real, let's say, physical unwinding and then, afterwards, the
integration that we started this year. So this means we have, this year, the big investments;
and we start to realize the positive eﬀects next year. So that's a measure that, let's say,
really actually starts right now this year. And we see the eﬀect in 2012 and the coming
years.

Bloomberg Transcript

Another example for this type of measure takes a bit longer is corporate IT, and that's
taken care of by German Egloﬀ. And here again, we have quite essential investments in,
for instance, consolidating the diﬀerent data centers throughout the Group, before we
see the positive results then in '11, and especially in '12.
So these are the two main reasons the investment dynamics, and some measures that take
a bit longer for realizing their value that are the drivers for this hockey stick.

Q - Rene Locher

{BIO 1921075 <GO>}

Thanks

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Then I will expand on the sale of, or the shortening of the duration. In Nonlife you can see
actually the details on page 54, that we have shortened the duration from 4.8 years to 4.5
years in Nonlife.
And now this fact, on page 15, that you see a negative ﬁgure there is solely attributable to
the foreign exchange. And each ﬁgure you also have to foreign exchange variation. And
for that reason, you would have to take the other position also together with the loss,
because in other you have the hedges. And if you then look at Nonlife and Life, you see
that in Nonlife we almost get even with the two ﬁgures, and in Life we have even a very
positive ﬁgure, if you take the two together. And that's why the hedge ratio on Life is
netly[ph] higher than in Nonlife.
