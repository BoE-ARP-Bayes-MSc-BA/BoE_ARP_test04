{BIO 1735942 <GO>}

Thank you for joining us. As we said in our earnings release, Chubb produced excellent
results in the Second Quarter of 2013. We generated operating income per share of $1.77
and net income per share of $2.21, both of which were among the highest of any quarter
in Chubb's history. These results were achieved despite the adverse impact of
catastrophe losses of $0.59 per share.

Bloomberg Transcript

Earnings in the quarter benefited from a positive effect on earned premiums of rate
increases in recent periods and a continued low level of non-CAT loss activity. Net written
premiums for the quarter were flat. We produced a combined ratio of 88.8, including
nearly 8 points of catastrophe losses. Excluding catastrophes, our combined ratio was
80.9%, which is 5.4 points better than the Second Quarter of last year, and the best exCAT combined ratio we have had in any quarter since 2007. These results reflect our
focus on bottom-line profitability, underwriting discipline and push for higher rates,
necessitated by the dual headwinds of lower investment income and continued high
levels of catastrophe losses.
Annualized operating ROE for the Second Quarter was 13.1%. Annualized GAAP ROE was
14.7%. GAAP book value per share at June 30, 2013 was $60.76. Our capital position is
excellent, and we made good progress in our share repurchase program, as Ricky will
discuss later.
In terms of the US market environment, the data would indicate that the Second Quarter
was at least as strong as the first. In homeowners, renewal change increased nearly half a
point to just over 7 points, and is now more than 2 points higher than in the Second
Quarter of 2012, without any impact on retention.
Professional Liability was especially strong with a 9 point renewal rate increase, the same
as in the First Quarter, with retention moving up 3 points from 81 to 84. Professional
Liability renewal rate increases are now 2 points higher than they were in all of calendar
year 2012, with a slightly high retention level.
In standard commercial lines, renewal rates continue to increase at an 8% level, consistent
with our experience over the last 18 months. With retention dropping 1 point from 84 to
83, due to the intentional nonrenewal of one large poor performing account.
Outside the US, renewal rates for CCI and CSI range from flat to low single-digit
increases. We also had rate improvement in Personal Lines comparable to that in the US.

FINAL

Coming on the heels of a great First Quarter, the outstanding Second Quarter helped us
attain a record operating income per share of $3.91 for the first six months of 2013, as well
as record net income per share of $4.69. In light of our performance in the first half of the
year and our outlook for the second half, we have increased our guidance for full-year
2013 operating income per share to a range of $7.30 to $7.50 from the $6.40 to $6.80
range we provided in our January 2013 guidance.
We have raised our guidance despite an increase in our catastrophe loss assumption for
the full year, from 4percentage points to 4.6 points.
And now for more details on our operating performance, we will start with Paul, who will
discuss Chubb's commercial and specialty insurance operations.

Thanks, John. The Chubb commercial insurance net written premiums for the Second
Quarter declined 3% to $1.3 billion. The combined ratio was 89.9 versus 97.5 in the Second
Quarter of 2012. The impact of catastrophes in the Second Quarter of 2013 was
8.1percentage points, nearly identical to the 8.2 points we had in the corresponding
quarter of 2012. Excluding the impact of catastrophes, CCI's Second Quarter combined
ratio improved 7.5 points to 81.8 from 89.3 in the Second Quarter of 2012, due to
improved rate levels as well as unusually low non-CAT property losses.
We are pleased that CCI's average US renewal rates increased in the Second Quarter by
8%, the ninth consecutive quarter of rate increases in the United States for CCI. The 8%
compares with the 8% we obtained in this year's First Quarter and 9% in the year-ago
Second Quarter. This level of rate increases has been consistent through the past six
quarters.
CCI obtained US renewal rate increases in each line of business in the Second Quarter of
2013. General liability rates increased the most, with a low double-digit average. These
were followed by monoline property, Workers' Compensation, package, excess umbrella,
automobile, boiler and Marine. Rate increases across the product lines were very similar
to what we obtained in the First Quarter of this year.
In CCI markets outside of the United States, average renewal rate increases in Canada,
Europe and Australia were in the low single-digit range in the Second Quarter, similar to
the First Quarter of this year. Average renewal rates in Latin America and Asia were flat in
the Second Quarter, also similar to the First Quarter. CCI's Second Quarter US renewal
retention rate was 83%, down 1 point from the First Quarter of the year.
CCI's new to lost business ratio in the United States was 0.7-to-1 in the Second Quarter,
down from 0.8-to-1 in the First Quarter. The 3% decline in CCI's worldwide premiums in
the Second Quarter included a 7% decline in written premiums outside of the United
States. With the exception of Asia-Pacific, premiums declined in each of CCI's three other
zones outside of the United States. Growth was down the most in Europe, where the
sluggish economy negatively impacted renewal exposure growth.

FINAL

In addition, in many countries and industry segments outside of the US, we experienced
greater resistance to rate increases. And this took a toll on both renewal retention and
new account acquisition. As we remain disciplined in our underwriting and pricing analysis,
we find certain segments of the market are still unattractively priced. Finally, our growth
outside the US reflected a small adverse impact from currency translation.
In the United States, CCI premiums in the Second Quarter were down 1%, reflecting the
slight decline in retention, along with a decline in renewal exposure. These declines
resulted primarily from our decision to not renew a large unprofitable account, and to
greatly reduce our participation on another sizable account, which has substantial CAT
exposure in the Northeast.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to Chubb's Specialty Insurance. Net written premiums declined 2% in the Second
Quarter, to $626 million. And the combined ratio was 86%. For the Professional Liability
portion of CSI, net written premiums were down 1% to $549 million. And the combined
ratio was 91.9 -- a 6 point improvement compared to the 97.9 we recorded in the Second
Quarter of 2012. We are very encouraged that average renewal rates for Professional
Liability in the US increased by 9% in the Second Quarter, making it the seventh
consecutive quarter of rate increases. The 9% increase compares to 9% in the First
Quarter of this year, and 7% in the Second Quarter a year ago.
CSI obtained renewal rate increases in the United States in each of its Professional Liability
lines of business in the Second Quarter of 2013. Rate increases were led by private
company D&O, which experienced average renewal rate increases in the mid-teens.
Private company D&O rate increases were followed by EPL, not-for-profit D&O, public
company D&O, prime, E&O, and fiduciary.
In markets outside of the United States, average renewal rates for Professional Liability
improved in the Second Quarter by low single digits with small variations by territory.
Renewal premium retention for Professional Liability in the Second Quarter was 84% in the
US, an improvement of 3 points over the First Quarter. The new to lost business ratio for
Professional Liability in the US also improved to 0.7-to-1 in the Second Quarter, from 0.6to-1 in the First Quarter of this year.
With respect to the overall market tone for Professional Liability lines in the Second
Quarter, we saw the US market experience a more widespread acceptance of the need
for rate increases for the typical account, especially in the EPL and private company D&O
lines. In fact, in the United States, we secured rate increases on 84% of all the Professional
Liability policies that we renewed in the Second Quarter, compared to 73% in the First
Quarter.
Regarding the surety portion of CSI, net written premiums in the Second Quarter were
down 7% to $77 million. And the combined ratio was an outstanding 42.1. As you know,
surety is a lumpy business. For example, the 7% decline in Second Quarter surety
premiums is in contrast to the 30% growth we experienced in the First Quarter of this
year when several existing customers won larger bondable projects.

And with that, I will turn it over to Dino, who will review our Personal Lines results, as well
as corporate wide claims.

FINAL

Dino Robusto

{BIO 15021398 <GO>}

Thanks, Paul. Chubb Personal Insurance net written premiums increased 4% to $1.2 billion,
and CPI produced a combined ratio of 89.6 compared to 91.2 in the corresponding
quarter last year. The impact of catastrophes on CPI's Second Quarter combined ratio
was 12.7 points in 2013. In the Second Quarter a year ago, the CAT impact on CPI's
combined ratio was 11.5 points.
On an ex-CAT basis, CPI's combined ratio was 76.9 in the Second Quarter compared to
79.7 in the Second Quarter of 2012. Homeowners premiums grew 4% for the quarter, and
the combined ratio was 86.9 compared to 90.3 in the corresponding quarter last year.
CAT losses accounted for 20.1 points of the homeowners combined ratio in the Second
Quarter of 2013, compared to 18 points in the Second Quarter of 2012.
I will provide more detail on catastrophes when I review corporate wide claims activity.
Excluding the impact of catastrophes, the 2013 Second Quarter homeowners combined
ratio improved to 66.8 from 72.3 in the same period a year ago, reflecting an unusually
low level of non-CAT fire losses.

Bloomberg Transcript

Personal auto premiums increased 5%, and the combined ratio was 95.3 compared to
93.2 in the Second Quarter of 2012. The growth in personal auto for the quarter reflected
higher premiums, both in the United States and outside the US.
In other personal, which includes our accident, personal access liability, and yacht lines,
premiums were up 3%, and the combined ratio was 93.3 compared to 92.6 in the Second
Quarter a year ago. Quality retention in the Second Quarter was 91% for homeowners and
89% for auto, both of which are essentially unchanged from the First Quarter of 2013 and
the Second Quarter of 2012. In the Second Quarter of 2013, we achieved homeowners
rate and exposure premium increases totaling about 7% in the United States. In short,
Personal Lines had another excellent quarter.
Turning now to claims corporate wide, catastrophe losses for the Second Quarter totaled
$237 million before tax, with $173 million coming from the US and $64 million stemming
from catastrophes outside the US. Personal Lines accounted for about 55% of the
catastrophe losses, and commercial lines for about 45%.
There were 14 declared CAT events in the United States in the Second Quarter of this
year. However, most of the losses we experienced were from four severe thunderstorms,
hail and wind events, in the central United States. The most severe of the four was the
tornado in Moore, Oklahoma, which particularly affected one of our large commercial
customers. Outside the United States, we had five CAT events, but roughly 90% of our
losses were attributable to the floods in Southern Alberta. Several affluent communities in
Calgary, where we have a significant market share of the high-value homes, were

Page 5 of 23

particularly impacted by this unprecedented event in Alberta's recorded history. By
contrast, we had virtually no losses from the severe flooding event in Central Europe.
Now I'll turn it over to Ricky, who will review our financial results in more detail.

FINAL

Richard Spiro

{BIO 15061279 <GO>}

Thanks, Dino. As usual, I will discuss our financial results for the quarter, and I will also
review our updated earnings guidance. Looking first at our operating results, we had
strong underwriting income of $317 million in the quarter compared to $159 million in the
Second Quarter a year ago. Property and Casualty investment income after tax was down
6% to $286 million, due once again to lower reinvestment rates in both our domestic and
international fixed maturity portfolios.

Bloomberg Transcript

Net income was higher than operating income in the quarter, due to net realized
investment gains before tax of $179 million or $0.44 per share after-tax, of which $0.12 per
share came from our alternative investments. During the quarter, we also recognized a
gain of $0.21 per share related to the merger of Alterra Capital and Markel Corporation.
The remainder of our gains during the quarter came principally from the sale of equity
securities.
For comparison, in the Second Quarter of 2012, we had net realized investment gains
before tax of $47 million or $0.11 per share after-tax, of which $0.13 per share came from
alternative investments. Unrealized depreciation[ph] before tax at June 30, 2013 was $2
billion compared to $3.1 billion at the end of the First Quarter. Unrealized depreciation[ph]
declined this quarter due to the recent sharp rise in interest rates.
The total carrying value of our consolidated investment portfolio was $42.9 billion as of
June 30. The composition of our portfolio remains largely unchanged from the prior
quarter. The average duration of our fixed maturity portfolio is 3.8 years, and the average
credit rating is AA three. We continue to have excellent liquidity at the Holding Company.
At June 30, 2013, our Holding Company portfolio had $2 billion of investments, including
approximately $600 million of short-term investments.
Book value per share under GAAP at June 30, 2013 was $60.76 compared to $60.45 at
year-end 2012, and $58.54 a year ago. GAAP book value in the quarter was negatively
affected by the change in unrealized depreciation that I described earlier. Adjusted book
value per share, which we calculate with available-for-sale fixed maturities and amortized
cost, was $57.03 compared to $53.80 at 2012 year-end and $52.34 a year ago.
As for loss reserves, we estimate that we had favorable development in the Second
Quarter of 2013 on prior-year reserves by SBU as follows. In CPI, we had about $40
million. CCI had $115 million. CSI had $55 million, and reinsurance assumed had $5 million,
bringing our total favorable development to about $215 million for the quarter. This
represents a favorable impact on the Second Quarter combined ratio of about 7 points
overall.

FINAL

For comparison, in the Second Quarter of 2012, we had about $165 million of favorable
development for the Company overall, including $30 million in CPI, $85 million in CCI, $40
million in CSI, and $10 million in reinsurance assumed. The favorable impact on the
combined ratio in the Second Quarter of 2012 was about 5.5 points, including about half a
point of favorable development for prior-year catastrophes.
For the Second Quarter of 2013, our ex-CAT accident year combined ratio was 88
compared to 91.4 in last year's Second Quarter, an improvement of nearly 3.5 points.
During the Second Quarter of 2013, our loss reserves increased by $19 million, including
an increase of $36 million for the insurance business and a decrease of $17 million for the
reinsurance assumed business, which is in runoff. The overall increase in reserves reflects
an increase of about $60 million related to catastrophes, and the impact of currency
translation of loss reserves during the quarter resulted in an increase in reserves of about
$50 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to capital management, during the Second Quarter, we repurchased
approximately 3.7 million shares at an aggregate cost of $323 million. The average cost of
our repurchases in the quarter was $87.28 per share. At the end of the Second Quarter,
we had $758 million available for share repurchases under our current authorization. as we
have said previously, we expect to complete this program by the end of January 2014.
Before turning it back to John, let me provide you with some additional details on our
revised guidance. We have increased our guidance for operating income per share for the
full year to a range of $7.30 to $7.50 from the range of $6.40 to $6.80 that we have
provided in January. As John mentioned, our increased guidance reflects our strong exCAT operating performance in the first half of this year, as well as our outlook for the
balance of the year.
Our increased guidance is based upon the following underlying assumptions. We expect
our combined ratio for 2013 to be about 88, compared to the January guidance
assumption of 89 to 91. We are assuming 5 points of catastrophe losses for the second
half of 2013. Based on the 4.3 points of actual CAT losses that we had in the first half, our
assumption for the full year calculates to 4.6 points, or it's 6/10 of a point higher than the
4 point CAT assumption in our original guidance. This increase in our catastrophe
assumption is more than offset by the expected improvement in our full-year ex-CAT
combined ratio.
For those who would like to make a higher or lower CAT assumption, the impact of each
percentage point of catastrophe losses for the full year on operating income per share is
approximately $0.30. We expect net written premiums for the full year to increase 1% to
3%, including a 1% negative impact of foreign currency translation based on exchange
rates as of June 30, 2013. Our January 2013 guidance had assumed that net written
premiums would be up 2% to 4%, with no impact of foreign currency translation.
We expect Property and Casualty investment income after-tax to be down 6% to 8%. Our
January guidance assumed a decline of 7% to 9%. Finally, we assumed 259 million

average diluted shares are outstanding for the full year, compared to 260 million shares in
our January guidance.
And now I'll turn it back to John.

FINAL

John Finnegan

{BIO 1735942 <GO>}

We had an outstanding Second Quarter with operating earnings per share of $1.77 and an
annualized operating ROE of 13.1. This performance is driven by a terrific ex-CAT
combined ratio of 80.9. These results came on top of a record First Quarter performance
and resulted in record six-month operating income per share of $3.91, an ex-CAT
combined ratio of 82.4, and an annualized operating ROE of 14.7. GAAP ROE for the first
six months was 15.6. And it's frequently been the case over the last few years, this quarter
was marked by a high level of catastrophe losses and an unusually low level of non-CAT
losses. On the catastrophe side, losses have been above our historical averages for the
last three years, and this trend has continued into the first half of 2013.

Bloomberg Transcript

It's a combination of higher catastrophe losses and lower investment yields, which
continues to drive our rate base[ph]. Excluding catastrophe, our first half combined ratio
of 82.4 was the second-best we have recorded in recent memory. These outstanding
results have been driven in part by significant rate increases, which have resulted in
longer-term margin expansion in the United States. And our current rate is now running
about 2 to 3 points above[ph] our long-term ex-CAT loss from core[ph] insurance.
In addition to margin expansion, our results have benefited from an unusually low level of
non-catastrophe related losses, which recently have been running well below longer-term
trend lines. In part, this can be ascribed to rigorous underwriting initiatives implemented
two years ago to call our existing book and to greatly enhance underwriting discipline as it
relates to new business. Both have had the intended effect of significantly re-profiling our
book for the better.
At the same time, however, we recognize that we've also enjoyed a great deal of good
fortune in terms of the unusually low level of non-catastrophe-related losses. This is
particularly illustrated by our outstanding first half results in our commercial and
homeowners property lines, where we had benefited from the absence of almost any
large losses. In homeowners alone, fire losses were down 5 points in the Second Quarter
from historical averages.
In terms of the current environment, the US market remains firm, as evidenced by the fact
that we continue to achieve mid to high single-digit rate increases in all of our business
units in the Second Quarter, with generally stable retention levels. Assuming rate
increases that are close to current levels in the second half of the year, this should result
in continued margin expansion, although actual results in the second half will be more a
function of swings in actual loss experience than longer-term trends.
In developing our updated guidance, we believe it to be overly optimistic to assume that
large losses would continue to run at unusually low levels. Thus we have assumed some
Page 8 of 23



Company N ame: Chubb L td
Company Ticker: CB US Equity
Date: 2013-07-25

FINAL

partial reversion to hire historical levels of loss experience from large losses in the second
half of the year. This is one of the reasons for our forecast 2 point deterioration in our
second half ex-CAT combined ratio from our near-record first-half performance. Even with
this forecasted deterioration, our revised guidance at the midpoint implies operating
income per share in the second half of $3.49, which would be the best operating EPS of
any second half in our history.
The bottom line is that we performed superbly in the first half of 2013 from both a market
and profitability perspective. Going forward, we're optimistic about the rest of the year, as
is evidenced by our updated guidance. As Ricky has indicated, all of this results in updated
operating income per share guidance of $7.30 to $7.50 for the full year, which would easily
be record calendar year results for Chubb.
And with that, I will open the line to questions.

Questions And Answers

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Thanks. Good afternoon and congrats on the results. Two quick questions. I guess first is
the numbers question. You mentioned there was a large and profitable account that was
nonrenewed. Can you sort of qualify what the impact was?

A - John Finnegan

{BIO 1735942 <GO>}

It was about 1 point. It was about the entire reason for the 1 point decline in retention. Now
as there are obviously a lot of pluses and minuses, around that, but it was about 1 point.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

1 point. Okay, that's helpful. The other question is in the opening remarks you mentioned
this is the ninth consecutive quarter of rate increases. Obviously, very strong rates. As you
look forward, do you expect to be able to push forward for these rates? Or do you think
we are at an inflection point in terms of pricing?

A - John Finnegan

{BIO 1735942 <GO>}

I don't have a crystal ball, and there are lots of opinions all over the place. I would say that
we had a strong a Second Quarter as we had a first. And we seem to be off to a pretty
good start in the Third Quarter. So I guess trees don't grow to heaven and some time it
may change, but right now, we're feeling pretty good about the market.

Got it. And then can you also talk about -- and this is the last question -- on I guess the
interplay between exposure change and the economy, have you seen some initial impact
of that on your numbers yet?

FINAL

A - Paul Krump

{BIO 5211397 <GO>}

Hi, Amit. This is Paul, and thanks for congratulating us on the quarter. As respects of the
CCI numbers, the interplay here was quite interesting for the quarter. First of all, Workers'
Compensation actually had some renewable exposure increase. That means that our
customers actually gave us higher payroll projections for the year going forward than they
had in the past.
The drop was really in the other lines. And I would tell you that after Irene and Sandy, we
looked at our CAT exposure, in particular in the Northeast, and there were a number of
accounts where we decided to take smaller participations on them. That drop-off in
participation gets recorded as an exposure drop-off, and that's really what impacted the
exposure.
As respects going forward, you probably have a better handle than I do on the economy,
but I think it's probably much the same. But I don't think we will have the same type of
culling exercise going on in the Northeast that we experienced in the Second Quarter.

Got it, thanks. Thanks for the answers. That's it.

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Could you comment on pricing and competition in Personal Lines in the US, auto versus
homeowners?

A - Dino Robusto

{BIO 15021398 <GO>}

Yes in our case, the pricing continues; we continue to have good momentum in both auto
and homeowners. On our homeowner rate increases, we are in the process of filing mid
to high single digits, and up to about the low-teens in some areas of the Northeast, as I
mentioned previously. And so that's -- so continued momentum, because you're looking
at historically 2011, we had ended the year with a homeowner renewal change written
impact for rate and exposure of about 3%. By year-end '12, we had gotten a 5% and we
expect to have about 7% at the end of '13.
And in auto, we have gotten a couple of points of rate and we're also seeing some
exposure on auto. And we expect that to continue. The momentum is good on both
homeowners and auto.

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

And what about auto loss cost expenses, if I may?

FINAL

A - Dino Robusto

{BIO 15021398 <GO>}

Yes, so, our loss cost trend on auto is roughly about 3 points. So with our pricing and our
exposure changes that we are seeing, we're about at loss cost and going forward, we will
see some meaningful margin expansion. You know, all else, of course, being equal.

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Okay, and lastly, I know you guys don't have a crystal ball, but you do have a decent size
book of business of Workers' Comp. Does Chubb expect medical loss inflation levels to
rise next year when the Affordable Care Act is implemented?

A - John Finnegan

{BIO 1735942 <GO>}

Paul?

A - Paul Krump

{BIO 5211397 <GO>}

I don't think that we are necessarily going to predict which way it's going to flow. We have
had a lot of debates here, but at this point, it's really the House is divided if it's going to
go up or maybe even come down.

{BIO 16836287 <GO>}

Wanted to just sort of understand from an ROE perspective, things are running really well
now. Sounds like you're not going to take the foot off on the pricing side; margins should
continue to expand. Is there an ROE that you are sort of aiming for or we're trying to get

{BIO 15061279 <GO>}

(multiple speakers) Sure. Hey, Greg, it's Ricky. As we have stated in the past, our ROE
target has been pretty consistent over the last number of years. Our goal is to achieve a
return on equity of inflation plus 10% over the life of the cycle. This obviously would imply
that we would expect to (technical difficulty) this target in hard markets and possibly
underperforming and soft markets. And if you look at our historical results, we have
tracked pretty well with this objectives from past cycles. And at this time, we're sticking
with that ROE target.

Okay, are you at that target now? I mean, it seems like you guys are hitting that.

FINAL

A - Richard Spiro

{BIO 15061279 <GO>}

Yes, we are hitting at when you look at it on a reported basis, but when you look at it on
an accident year basis, even with the 88% ex-CAT accident year combined ratio we had in
the Second Quarter, if you add a normalized CAT load on top of that, and we can all
debate what's the right normalized CAT load, you are still talking about accident year
ROEs that are high single-digits, low double digits. And that's for us, and we think our
numbers are going to be probably as good as anyone in the industry. Right? So if you look
at the rest of industry, they are still in single-digit land in terms of ROE on an accident year
basis.

With regard to the pace of rate improvement, particularly in CCI, we have heard from a
number of other insurers that the pace of improvement in rate and price has crested. So
I'm just thinking -- I am just trying to get a better sense of what you feel is different about
your book that rate increases are sustained not only in 2Q, but you're saying also that
could probably be the case for the remainder of this year.

A - Paul Krump

{BIO 5211397 <GO>}

Hey, Jay, it's Paul. I will take a stab at this. Maybe just talk a little bit about the Second
Quarter and then what we know so far. I mean, rate increases for commercial business in
June were very consistent with the overall rate increases for the entire Second Quarter.
With respect to the market in July, we obviously do not have the final data for the month.
However, based on the preliminary assessment of interim monthly reports, some of the
feedback from our most trusted field officers, we're seeing no significant change in
overall market tone.
This is probably at odds with some of the industry participants who have suggested that
some parts of the commercial market may be softening or experiencing some additional
competition. But probably the big difference with us is that we are primarily a middlemarket commercial player. We hear the talk about the large property accounts. We have
much less participation in that jumbo risk management property market than many others
that might be making those comments.
So, we'll -- right now everything that we see, it's very much similar to what we saw in First
Quarter and what we saw in the Second Quarter. And speculating going forward is -Page 12 of 23

we're just not going to do it.

FINAL

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Okay. And then the other point I just wanted to clarify was on the 2Q CSI, the downshifting
in growth there. I mean, I know you talked about pulling back a bit on catastrophe
exposed commercial accounts, and including in the Northeast, but I'm just wondering what
else is going on there to have overall CCI down 3% year-over-year, when it was, I believe,
up around 3% in the First Quarter?

A - Richard Spiro

{BIO 15061279 <GO>}

Yes, you're going to see some bouncing around when it comes to the exposure. I mean, it
really was -- I think the anomaly when we looked at it really was that that action that we
were taking on a number of the property accounts. Obviously, the sluggish economy is
playing a role here. And then overseas is playing a big piece of it as well.
In the markets overseas, we haven't been getting the overall rate increases that we've
been getting in the United States. Our focus overseas is very much like it is the United
States. It's on profit. Our book overseas is as profitable as our book in the United States
over the recent years. So what we still believe ultimately we need to take rate there as
well.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - John Finnegan

{BIO 1735942 <GO>}

Yes, I would add that I think the Second Quarter had a few anomalies in it, but I do think
that growth will be -- will not be robust in CCI, given our focus on profitability. However,
we are certainly inspecting to be back in the positive zone and CCI growth in the second
half of the year without affecting the way we underwrite some -- what we have in
guidance implies a positive growth in CCI in the second half of the year.

Q - Jay Gelb

{BIO 21247396 <GO>}

Makes sense, thank you.

A - Richard Spiro

{BIO 15061279 <GO>}

This is Ricky. One quick clarification to my earlier comment on accident year ROE. I just
want to make it clear that when I'm talking about accident year returns, we are talking
about new money rates and not looking at the existing portfolio yields in our portfolio.
Thanks.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

So I guess first question, do you guys -- by any chance, do you use, Ricky, any derivatives
or anything on the interest rate management side as far as the portfolio is concerned?
Page 13 of 23



Company N ame: Chubb L td
Company Ticker: CB US Equity

And is there an interest rate scenario where you might do that? Or is that not kind of part
of the protocol?

FINAL

A - Richard Spiro

{BIO 15061279 <GO>}

You know, it's something that we have looked at from time to time. We just never thought
that the risk reward of it made sense, so we have not been in the past. I wouldn't rule it
out, but it is not something we have done historically to any great extent.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it. And then I guess -- I mean, I try to do the math and get close, but if you were to
back out in the Second Quarter, I mean, how much of the increase in guidance is related
to the big favorable development that we saw in the Second Quarter, as opposed to
better outlook for the back half of the year on an underlying basis?

A - John Finnegan

{BIO 1735942 <GO>}

I'll take that. It's sort of two different questions. I mean, obviously, the improvement of
guidance for the year is a function of how well we did in the first half, to some degree,
clearly.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Right.

A - John Finnegan

{BIO 1735942 <GO>}

As I said, we are forecasting about a 2 point deterioration in ex-CAT combined ratio in the
second half from the first half, due to what we believe to be the -- it would be very bullish
to assume we're going to continue to have such a low level of large losses. Now that 2
point deterioration still gives us a second half which -- ex-CAT combined ratio, which is
better than our initial January guidance for the full year.
How those come about, those -- come in a variety of scenarios, and a large losses hit in a
variety of ways, whether it be by business unit or accident year, prior period development.
So we don't break out any prior period development number for the second half of the
year. I think that attainment of our objective in the second half will require some prior
period development, clearly. But it's under a variety of scenarios. It has no precise
development number in it.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Thanks. So I mean, and I guess Professional Liability, you are definitely getting a lot of rate.
It seems like there may be some new folks looking to compete there. Obviously, you are
not seeing that. But when I look at the rate gain that you've gotten, I mean, we're still kind
of now several quarters of now mid to high single-digit rate gains -- I'm sorry, I've got one,
two, three, four five -- five quarters above 5%. But it looks like if all the development in
that segment is related to Personal Liability, you are still writing that business at over
100%. And maybe my math is wrong, but it seems to be the case.

Page 14 of 23



Company N ame: Chubb L td
Company Ticker: CB US Equity
Date: 2013-07-25

So I am just trying to connect those two. At what point do you get to -- how much more
rate do you need to get to action in your underwriting profitability there?

FINAL

A - John Finnegan

{BIO 1735942 <GO>}

Well, that's a good point. Your farmer's math is good. We ran the accident year at about
100% in the Second Quarter, similar to First Quarter, slightly better. If you compare it to
last year, our reported number was significantly better -- 6 or 7 points. And about half of
that was more development. The other half we had an improvement of 3 points or so. A
little -- an accident year, combined ratio. It would be closer to four if you add for the loss
ratio.
We talked about this on the year end call and the First Quarter call. We're not obviously
happy with where we are. The rate we're getting is going to help us. Our loss ratios have
continued to improve. It's a long tail line of business so I wouldn't expect we'd have a
significant improvement in accident year during the current year. You know, we have to
get the data in.
But if rates continue, we will continue to improve next year in our accident year. And we
are on the right -- but we have a ways to go in Professional Liability. You're going to get
that down pretty low. But, fortunately, we have a good deal of development that's
occurred so we're happy about that.

Got it. And then just last one, I don't know, Ricky. if you could talk a little bit about the
reinsurance program. Any changes in price or coverage that you purchased specifically?
And did you take up or did you have any alternative capital participants take up any of
your program? Thanks.

A - Richard Spiro

Sure, I talked a little bit about the renewal of our cap program on the last call. And there

Thank you for taking the call. So over the past couple of years, you folks have been awfully

Page 15 of 23



Company N ame: Chubb L td

from sort of a clear focus on profitability to one that's a bit more balanced with growth, in
US commercial and specialty, for example?

FINAL

A - John Finnegan

{BIO 1735942 <GO>}

Well, I think, you take specialty, I mean, we've got to continue to focus -- you heard the
answer to the last question, we have to continue to focus on profitability, because at
100[ph], there is no balance to be had. I mean, an accident year of 100[ph] just isn't
acceptable. So we will have a foot on the metal on that one for a while. If the market
continues to improve, we will see some growth to go with it. But we shall see.

A - Dino Robusto

{BIO 15021398 <GO>}

In commercial, obviously, we have a more profitable book. We're hoping that, given the
rate environment that you're going to see some new business now that's acceptable to
us. More rates improved and more likely that is to occur, prefer a little improvement in
Europe.
I think that you will see that the Second Quarter, when growth was low, 4% in the First
Quarter was probably in line with the industry. And we expect to revert to the positive in
the third and Fourth Quarters. So we will always err on the side of profitability, especially in
areas that require more rate, but we expect growth to improve from the Second Quarter
as we get into the second half of this year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Josh Stirling

{BIO 17463087 <GO>}

Got it, that's helpful. And a question -- just follow-up on the question of low double-digit
ROEs is sort of with new money pricing targets, the question would be with written rate is
running ahead of earned, and we're starting to see the money rates rise, when you're
sitting and working with your actuaries, what sort of magnitude of rate increases do you
think we still need? And I think that is sort of a factual question, not a forecast one.

A - John Finnegan

{BIO 1735942 <GO>}

Well, first, I'll start on that. Written rate now, just to clarify, we have kind of caught up with
earned rate and written rate for the most part, except in Personal Lines, there's a little to
go. But in commercial has been running 8% for so long, and written and earned is there.
And professional, there's not much of a difference. Personal, maybe there is a point or
two difference.
So think of written and earned as being pretty close together. Now in terms of money
rates, I will let Ricky take that.

A - Richard Spiro

{BIO 15061279 <GO>}

Sure. Look, obviously, we welcome the impact of higher yields on our investment income,
but as I mentioned earlier, even with -- where new money rates are today, we're still not
making what we deem to be acceptable accident year ROEs. And, again, the industry is
doing probably well behind us. So while the rise in rates is a nice -- in interest rates, is a

Page 16 of 23



Company N ame: Chubb L td

nice thing, it's certainly better than a decline in interest rates. And there is still a long way
to go, and we don't see that really impacting our push for rate.

Great, thanks, and congrats on the quarter.

Q - Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Two questions. The first is, you brought up your yield assumption for the year on your
portfolio modestly, but you took it up a little bit. I assume -- I shouldn't say that -- you took
up your investment income assumption. Is that due to the good first half result? Or is it
more due to the recent rise in interest rates that we have seen?

A - Richard Spiro

{BIO 15061279 <GO>}

It's probably a combination, but the recent rise in interest rates has improved our outlook
for reinvestment yields going forward, compared to where we were when we started the
year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Got it. And I guess for Dino, I think I probably know the answer to this based on the
reserving actions you've taken, but can you talk about what you are seeing in liability
claims costs for some of the longer tail businesses you guys write?

A - Dino Robusto

{BIO 15021398 <GO>}

Yes. So I give you all a few sets on our claim trends. So I will start with -- I will give you
some counts, and then I will give you a little view of severity on claims in general.
Claim counts continue to be a good story in the US. Excluding catastrophes, P&C, new rise
claim counts overall were down about 5% for the Second Quarter against the prior
quarter, and down 3% for six months of 2013 compared to the first six months of 2012.
New rise counts increased slightly for personal auto, physical damage. We're seeing
exposure growth in that line. Homeowners, commercial property counts decreased
despite an increase in non-CAT weather. And new rise counts also decreased for
commercial Work Comp, commercial general liability and Professional Liability. And when
we get to severity and more of in line with your question, I mean, the trends obviously
vary significantly by line of business based on obviously the different cost drivers.
But we are seeing essentially claim cost severity increases that are generally consistent
with our longer-term trend assumptions, about low to mid-single digit severity for auto
classes; mid-single digits for the core property and general liability classes; and the mid to
upper single digits for Work Comp and some excess liability.

Page 17 of 23



Company N ame: Chubb L td

FINAL

Now on the longer tail Professional Liability severity, these we obviously look at a little bit
differently, from obviously auto and homeowners, where there is a lot more consistency.
So we tend to look at, as we've spoken in the past, some leading indicators such as
security class-action filings. And if you take a look at that, the number of SCA's under
Chubb qualities is done for the Second Quarter against the prior year quarter, and it's
lower than the average of the prior for Second Quarter. So, but in general, from a severity
standpoint, it's consistent with our longer-term assumptions that we have had.

Q - Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

And, obviously, no change for the adverse this quarter?

A - John Finnegan

{BIO 1735942 <GO>}

What -- no change for the what?

Q - Jay Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

For the worse this quarter. In other words, you're not seeing any deterioration in this
environment; it's remaining fairly benign. Is that fair?

A - John Finnegan

{BIO 1735942 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I think claims counts continue to come in very well. Loss experience on prior periods, as
you can tell, has come in very strong. Things have been looking good on the loss front for
about a year and a half now.

Q - Jay Cohen

Right. Thanks for the details.

Operator
Josh Shanker, Deutsche Bank.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Yes, mostly a numbers question. On the guidance revision on the CAT number, is the
increase related to higher-than-projected first half CATs? Or are you guys thinking we're
going to be more conservative going forward on how we project our CATs for the backhalf ?

A - Richard Spiro

{BIO 15061279 <GO>}

Last July, we used the 4.5 point assumption for CAT losses in the second half of the year
in our updated guidance, Josh. This year, we did decide to increase the PIC by half a
point, really to reflect a higher level of CAT losses that we've experienced in recent
periods. No real magic or silver bullet, but we definitely have seen an uptick in the second
half over the last few years, so we conservatively added half a point to our normal second
half assumption.

Probably comes from both, Josh. I mean a little bit, but primarily, from first half being
higher than one would imply by our original 4 points. Right? And then a little bit of
conservatism maybe in the second half, although no CAT assumptions have proved to be
conservative in recent memory.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Understandable, understandable. And then on the -- is there a new to retained business -or new to lost business ratio that you can now share with us, or some sort of details on
that?

A - John Finnegan

Were you talking about a particular business line?

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

I mean, in terms -- particularly in the CCI lines mostly, but I mean, if you -- the personal

the commercial lines.

Josh, in the early remarks, the prepared remarks, I gave it both for CCI and CSI and CI -how quickly we forget. It was 0.7-to-1 in the Second Quarter, which was down from 0.8-to-1

Company N ame: Chubb L td

FINAL

You are probably -- must be into the mathematics. I don't think we have that number,
because you know we can talk about fire losses, we can talk about non-CAT related
weather. You can get non-CAT related weather and you can itemize that a little bit more,
but quantify it better in personal lines and in commercial. Fire losses, especially can
quantify them in both.
And then you have specialty where large losses affect you too. So what I will tell you, in
the Second Quarter, if you look at -- year-over-year Second Quarter, we had a 5.5 point
improvement. 2 points of that was development; 3.4 points of that was accident year. If
you applied the margin expansion, the theoretical margin expansion number to it, which
assumes that your losses are running in line with longer-term cost trends, that's 2 points.
So it gives you 1.5 points in loss trends -- loss cost -- actual loss cost instead of a low trend
line of which a big bunch or maybe even all is related to unusual large losses.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay, that's very helpful. You talked for a while, I think, about the continued need for
some rate increases in Professional Liability. Have you been trying to take bigger rate
increases over the past couple of years than you have actually been able to?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - John Finnegan

{BIO 1735942 <GO>}

Oh, sure. When you're running 100[ph], you need a lot more. We have. I mean, if you go
back to only two years ago, we weren't getting any. I mean, so this has been kind of
ramped up and it's pretty good. We would like it either larger or we'd like the ones we
have to last a longer time. But we could use more rate in this business. And also some
improvement in the BPL area, a variety of areas where losses did trend up.

A - Paul Krump

{BIO 5211397 <GO>}

This is Paul. Just to augment what John just said, we don't just take a one-size-fits-all
approach, though, to the pricing in this business. We spend a lot of time thinking about
each account, and the thought is, what does it actually need? We tend to start out by
putting each of the accounts into one of five ranking, and go from there thinking about
what we really need.
There are certainly some accounts that we are happy to renew at flat, and there's others,
quite frankly, that we've gotten 40% to 50% rate increases on. And if they walk, they walk.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Understood. Okay, and one last question, if I can. Obviously, there has been a lot of talk
about the impact of interest rate increases on investment income expectations. I know
that you have been reserving sort of incredibly conservatively. We see that in the releases.
Is there any reason to expect the -- or future loss cost inflation to reflect the interest rate
increase?

A - John Finnegan

{BIO 1735942 <GO>}

Page 20 of 23



Company N ame: Chubb L td

FINAL

No, I don't think there's any direct relationship between the two, except to the extent that
you believe that inflation is going to run up with interest rates. We haven't seen that to
date. So you focus more on the underlying inflation rate than the interest rates. Obviously,
in many periods, they are correlated, but we haven't seen that yet. And even within the
inflation rate, you've got to look at things that are very important to us -- construction
costs, healthcare costs, not quite the same as the CPI.
I think as we said on endless calls, we have had very benign loss experience except for
two quarters in 2011 for a number of years. Inflation has been relatively low over that
period, but loss cost, things we've done have helped, loss cost trends have been good.
So right now, there is no sign of a lot greater inflation, so I don't think the interest rates
have anything to do that.

Bloomberg Transcript

The first question was a numbers question. Just wanted to clarify that the benefit from
lower large losses were about 1 to 1.5 points? Is that what you said before? (multiple
speakers) For the first half of this year?

A - John Finnegan

{BIO 1735942 <GO>}

Let me clarify then, Vinay. No, what I said is -- and I want to provide -- there is no real
number for that. But what I tried to do is say a question many of you ask is that how much
of the quarter's improvement was due to margin expansion, and how much was it due to
loss experience that was different than margin expansion? So I just took a simple analysis
of looking at this year's Second Quarter versus last year's Second Quarter, said it was
about a 5.5 point improvement, of which 2 points were attributable to favorable
development.
Of the other 3.5, you could theoretically attribute 2 to earned rate margin expansion. It
was about 1.5 points -- the 1.5 points I referred to was that loss experienced below
theoretical long cost loss -- long cost --

A - Richard Spiro

{BIO 15061279 <GO>}

Long-term.

A - John Finnegan

{BIO 1735942 <GO>}

-- long-term loss cost trends that are implicit in the margin expansion calculation. So if you
just thought it would improve by the amount of the margin expansion, we improved by 1.5
points better than that because of lower loss -- lower actual loss experience. And that I
Page 21 of 23



Company N ame: Chubb L td

think that a good deal, all -- or maybe even more than all were due to lower large losses.
But that's hard to break out.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

FINAL

Sure, and that's only for the Second Quarter? You're re not talking about the First Quarter,
correct?

A - John Finnegan

{BIO 1735942 <GO>}

Not talking about the First Quarter, although the First Quarter, I think we had pretty -- was
similar. I forget the exact numbers, but, yes, actual losses in the First Quarter were lower
than the long-term trend too.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Sure, fair enough. And these trends -- these are not specific only to Chubb, I mean I'm
sure it's true with everybody, correct? Low loss cost trends or low loss cost?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - John Finnegan

{BIO 1735942 <GO>}

Yes, let's say -- yes, I mean, I gather from the reports that it looks to me like -- I don't
know -- it looks like people have a pretty favorable loss experience. Non-CAT related
weather, for example, is probably going to be relatively similar to everyone. Fire losses
can be different. I mean, I don't think sometimes people underestimate the sensitivity. In a
quarter, we run $3 billion a premium. We have one[ph] limit fire loss of $30 million, you are
talking 1 point on your combined ratio that can't be explained by margin expansion. We
have had many quarters with one big loss or even two big losses. So fire losses tend to
be a little bit more unique to an individual company than non-CAT related weather.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Sure, fair enough, thank you. Just a second question. And like this is an overall loss,
industry question, and you guys have been pushing rate stronger and harder than I think
most people have. But within the industry, we have seen rising interest rates. We have
seen margins improving, low loss cost trends. What do you think keeps the momentum
going for the industry to keep rates high?

A - John Finnegan

I believe that -- we don't know that will occur. We hope it will occur. What would be the
driver? The driver would be the fact that, alluding to what Ricky said, that accident year exCAT combined ratios are not at target levels. Or stated another way, we have a rate need
to get our new business to an acceptable return. And if we have the rate need running
80's and 82's on our ex-CAT's accident year, you can imagine the industry has a
significantly higher rate need, they are probably in the mid-single digits. And that's not
everyone, but as an average, it couldn't be better than that.
So the industry has a need for rate adequacy still. And, again, that's doing the calc on new
money rates, as it should be done, what you can earn on new business.

And, also, don't forget as John pointed out in his remarks, the combination of the interest
rate environment plus the higher level of catastrophe losses that we in the industry have
experienced over the last number of years, that continue to push for rate.
