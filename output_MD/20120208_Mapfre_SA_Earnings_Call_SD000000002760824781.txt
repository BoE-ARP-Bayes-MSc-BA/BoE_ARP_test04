time all participants are in listen-only mode. There will be a presentation, followed by a
question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) I must advise you that this

{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

Thank you. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to MAPFRE's full-year 2011
results presentations. As usual I'll give an overview of the results and the main business
developments. Later, Mr. (Luis Davila) will explain the financials in greater detail and finally,
we will take your questions.
Please move to slide number three. Last year I began this call by saying that 2010 had not
been an easy year. Well 2011 was at least equally challenging from a macroeconomic and
market standpoint as well as the worst year on record for a non-insurance catastrophe
point of view. Against this backdrop I feel that the results of MAPFRE were exceptionally

good. Revenues and premiums grew about 15% against 9% in 2010. Profits grew 3.2%
against 0.7% in 2010, revenues per share grew 0.7% as opposed to 3.6% for a year ago.

FINAL

The combined ratio worsened but is seen in the life of the seasonal severity of
catastrophe losses, it was actually very good.
Assets under management grew a further 4.2% over a figures that last year has increased
15.5% due to the consolidation of CatalunyaCaixa. Overall, a performance we are very
proud of in which replace the strength of our (risk) business, the benefits of our expansion
abroad with our overall proven management approach.
Please move to the following slide. Here we highlight the results. The most important
thing maybe is the business growth in Spain and abroad. And in general we maintained
our tradition of growing more than the markets where we are present.

Bloomberg Transcript

We had a favorable trend in loss experience in the costliest year ever in terms of
catastrophe losses. We reinforced our focus on the insurance business together with such
significant improvement in results from non-insurance activities and we register a growth
in the recurrent financial results which has mitigated an impact of the market crisis in
excess of EUR100 million.
And also, we had strengthen our financial position. We have increased our equity over
EUR1.900 billion, which represents an increase of nearly 25%. We have larger interest
coverage than the year -- in the previous year. This year it is 36.5 times, against of 70
times in 2010. We have lower leverage, 15.6% against 19.8 % in 2010, and we remain with
a very, very high solvency margin of 287%, which is better than the previous year.
Let's move to next page. Here is a breakdown of the main non-recurring items in our
results. As I said before, this was the worst year on record in terms of insurance
catastrophe losses. Actually here we have included only those that had truly a seasonal in
with nature, such as the earthquakes in Japan and New Zealand, and the floods in
Thailand.
However, our figures were also strongly impacted by losses in the US, with costs (commit)
$95 million more that did see the previous year. In fact, in 2011 we registered EUR115
million and in the previous year, we registered only EUR20 million. We have also -- we
have had also the losses in Australia and in the US for MAPFRE. In any case, even
(inaudible) for this, our profits went up nearly 5% in terms of insurance profits.
We also dealt decisively with the losses from our non-insurance activities which have
disappeared. In fact, we recorded a small profit up to EUR0.5 million. Adjusting followed
with items, we are left with an underlying profit growth in excess of 5% which provides
evidence of the strength of the insurance business model in general, and of MAPFRE
specifically.

FINAL

Please move to the following slide. During the last year we have paid dividends for an
amount of EUR456.5 million, which represents an increase up to 2.7% and today the board
of directors has agreed to propose to the AGM the payment of a final dividend against
the 2011 results of EUR0.08 gross per share. The total dividend proposed against the 2011
results amounts to EUR0.15 per share.
In page seven, you can see the key highlights of the year. In January we launched Verti,
the MAPFRE FAMILIAR'S direct sales company for motor and home insurance. In April, we
transferred the shareholding in Banco De Servicios Finacieros Caja Madrid-MAPFRE to
Caja Madrid. And we purchased the 20 -- excuse me, the 12.5% of MAPFRE Internacional.
In June, we launched the start up of the alliance with Banco do Brasil. In August we
consolidated Middlesea Insurance in Malta. In October, a new operational structure was
put in place and finally in December, the announcement of the reorganizations of MAPFRE
and the changes in the Chairman that will be approved in the next meeting of the general
assembly of shareholders in March.

Bloomberg Transcript

Please move to the next slide. Here is a summary of our fihures. I just wish to highlight that
our premiums have now very close to EUR20 billion. Our profits are very close to EUR1
billion. Equity has continued to grow and debt has continued to fall while our solvency
levels have remained extremely strong and very close to three times the minimum
requirement.
As we said already we'll in greater detail our financial strength is consistent with a high AA
rating, although some rating agencies have a different view. Our return on equity remains
above 14% and these are the main figures. I will now hand the call to Mr. Luis Davila who
will explain the financials in greater detail. Thank you.

Luis Davila

{BIO 16121079 <GO>}

Thank you, Esteban. Good afternoon, to everybody on the line and over the internet and
with no further delay, please let's move to slide number 10. On this slide we can see the
breakdown of premiums and results by line of business and geographical areas.
The trend observed in previous years of an increasing rate of foreign business activities
continues as we have seen throughout the year. Such activities made up over 62% of
aggregated premiums against 59% in 2010. The contribution to total profits rose to 38%
from 30% a year ago, however, it must be said that this is affected by a series of nonrecurring items and catastrophe losses. If we were to adjust for these, the contribution
would be broadly stable at the level it was in 2010, which was 50% in the case of Spain,
and 30% in the case of foreign business activities.
On the following slide, number 11, we show the contribution of the various subsidiaries to
premium growth. Of the EUR2.7 billion aggregate increase shown on this page, EUR1.2
billion came from the business with Banco do Brasil. That means that even excluding this
venture, MAPFRE America was the main contributor to the increasing premiums, thanks to

Page 3 of 26

Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity

growth in motor, general and life protection insurance as well as new distribution
agreements.

FINAL

MAPFRE VIDA grew thanks to the strong sales performance in the agents network and the
full-year consolidation of CatalunyaCaixa. Growth was also notable in MAPFRE RE, which
benefitted from strong, new business inflows and Asistencia due to the consolidation of
Insure & Go and organic growth in Turkey and Latin America.
Premiums fell marginally in Spain due to the weak economic activity, however, relative to
the market the performance was especially strong in motor and household insurance,
which recorded positive growth rate and then increasing market shares.
Please, let's move to slide number 12 where the find the breakdown of sales in Spain by
distribution channel. The performance of the agents' channel reflected strong sales of
savings business in the lifeline and falling sales of commission insurance in non-life. The
growth in the bank assurance channel was due primarily to the full-year consolidation of
the insurance activities of CatalunyaCaixa and that applies to both life and non-life.

Bloomberg Transcript

On slide number 13, we have the development of the consolidated technical results, no
the technical result, sorry. At the consolidated level, as we've seen before on page
number three, the combined ratio was 1percentage point worse than in 2010, which given
the catastrophe claims, I consider as an excellent result.
It is evident at first glance where the catastrophe claims hit, which was the case of RE and
Internacional at the bottom of the chart. MAPFRE FAMILIAR had a better technical result
than in 2010 thanks to strong underwriting performance that more than compensated for
the increase in the expense ratio, which was due, among others, to the launch of Verti.
Global improved considerably over 2010, when it was strongly affected by the Chilean
earthquake. Compared to the previous quarter, the ratio deteriorated due to higher claim
severity and the appreciation of the dollar. Empresas had a very strong year thanks to
exceptional good frequency and severity. Compared to the previous quarter, there is a
slight deterioration.
America improved both -- compared to both the previous year and the previous quarter,
thanks to the good underwriting results of the business with Banco do Brasil.
On slide number 14 we find the non-life accounts. I believe I've explained at length the
development of premiums and losses on the previous slide. The expense ratio increased
due to the larger contribution from the Internacional business which, as we know,
especially in the case of America, has a higher cost ratio and a larger weight of business
originated through brokers and new channels. There is a strong general effect on the
account of the consolidation of BB Seguros, the banking group Seguros, and the financial
income has several items to be understood.

FINAL

On one hand, the realization gains were about EUR60 million lower in 2010, compared to
the previous year. Virtually we did not have any exchange rate differences and there are
write downs of about EUR34 million from exposure to Greek sovereign bonds.
On slide number 15, we have the life account. Here once again the account, year-on-year,
is strongly affected by the full year consolidation of the operations of CatalunyaCaixa and
the insurance operations of CatalunyaCaixa, the business with Banco do Brasil and
Middlesea, which has a sizeable life business in Malta.
The agents channel performed very well. In addition to that, and in addition to Banco do
Brasil, we had organic growth of business in Latin America and the very good
development of life re-insurance. And here, too, we have two items affecting the
underwriting and financial results. We have a gain of about EUR136 million recognize upon
the establishment of the alliance with Banco do Brasil and about EUR47 million of writedowns, once again, coming from Greek sovereign bonds.
On slide 16 we have the other business activities where we see, as we've been seeing
throughout the years, the year decrease in operating revenues and operating expenses
which comes from lower business volumes in MAPFRE FAMILIAR and its non-insurance
subsidiaries and the discontinuation of MAPFRE INMUEBLES real estate activities.

Bloomberg Transcript

The net financial income falls compared to the previous year -- the net financial loss falls
compared to the previous year and here, too, it reflects a combination of elements which
are detailed there on the slide. The negative result from the sale of Banco De Servicios
Finacieros.
Last year we had an impairment on the shares of Cattolica. There were revenues from
MAPFRE INMUEBLES, which now comes under this line as well as a new appropriation of
provisions for the depreciation of its property stock and as we had also see in the interest
coverage, lower interest payments for about EUR14 million.
The result from minority interest basically have disappeared until March. The reflected
would be a recognition of the result of Banco De Servicios Finacieros Caja MadridMAPFRE and the other revenues last year included impairment with property stock which,
as I said previously, this year forms part of the net financial income.
On slide 17 we have the developed results by subsidiaries. MAPFRE America turns out
because of the gains recognized after the granting of the authorization to create the
alliance with Banco do Brasil as well as the profits flowing from this alliance. MAPFRE
FAMILIAR shows a contraction which reflects the large realization gains recorded in 2010,
excluding realization gains and write-downs for both years, the net income would have
grown approximately 7%.
MAPFRE Internacional suffered a significant fall due to large, weather-related and
catastrophe claims in the US, partially compensated by larger realization gains. MAPFRE RE
also suffered a fall due to a series of catastrophe claims. This as, as Mr. Tejera was saying
before, was the worst year on record.

FINAL

MAPFRE Global Risks improved mainly because last year it was affected by catastrophe
claims, which was the case of the Chilean earthquake, and MAPFRE Empresas and
MAPFREVIDA recorded small losses due primarily to write-downs and in addition, MAPFRE
Empresas in 2010 had a considerably larger amount of realization gains.
On slide 18 we have the bottom line. There are several elements affecting this. We have
the agreements with Banco do Brasil, which is an impact. We have the restatement of
financial accounts for a similar amount in both years in Venezuela. We have the
appropriation of a provision for financial market instability, part of which -- most of which
was appropriated in June and the remainder in the last quarter of the year for a total
amount of EUR55.8 million, and the tax figure includes the positive impact of the sale of
the shareholding in Banco De Servicios Finacieros.

Bloomberg Transcript

On slide 19 we have the balance sheet. Here we have clearly the three elements which
the consolidation of Banco do Brasil, Middlesea, and to a lesser extent insurance -- Insure
& Go, which affect the variation. In 2011, we had the appreciation of the euro against the
main Latin American currencies. Clearly, as you may expect and we've seen throughout
the year, the market value of investments was negatively affected by the rise in the risk
premium.
We have an increase in other intangible assets and minority interest, which was actually
singled out precisely in this last quarter for the full-year account. This is because of the
value of business-acquired assignments to the assets consolidated after the alliance with
Banco -- the accounting of the alliance with Banco do Brasil, and we also see a decrease
in cash balances which was mainly due to the redemption of the senior bonds issued in
2011, which we did in July.
If we compare to the Third Quarter the balance sheet shows a notable increase in
goodwill along with larger intangible assets and the significant increase in minorities. As I
said before, this is due to the recognition of the value of business acquired, arising from
the business with Banco do Brasil.
On slide number 20, we have the breakdown of the investment portfolio as last year we
had three slides about this. The breakdown is broadly in line with 2010. We have a slightly
larger weight of government bonds. In terms of geographical breakdown, Spain has gone
up due to the purchase of government paper and Latin America due to the business with
Banco do Brasil, while the rest of Europe has fallen due to falls in the market value
primarily and to a minor extent, sales of some bonds.
Investments kept their value through P&L of double in weight, primarily because this is the
accounting approach employed by Middlesea, while investments held to maturity
increased primarily because Banco do Brasil accounts for a substantial part of its
investment through this approach.
On slide 21, we see an increase in the weight of government papers due to the
investment in Spanish government bonds I just cited, along with the fact that the large

Page 6 of 26



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2012-02-08

proportion of the holdings of the business with Banco do Brasil and Middlesea are made
up by government bonds.

FINAL

The weight of peripheral euro zone countries excluding Spain, has fallen to 11.1% from
18.5% a year ago, so it a decrease of more than 7percentage points. The weight of
financial institutions holdings also has fallen, in this case, by 6percentage points, while its
breakdown is broadly identical to 2010.
On slide 22, we have a further breakdown of the fixed-income portfolio. The breakdown
by type of guarantee is virtually unchanged. In terms of currency there is an obvious
increase in the weight of the Brazilian real from 4% in 2010 to 10% this year, and the
breakdown by ratings has recorded a downwards trend due to the numerous
downgrades by the rating agencies. Nevertheless, 86% of the portfolio remains rated
single A or better, while in 2010 the proportion was 92%. This breakdown was before the
downgrade of Spain by Standard & Poor's, which obviously would increase notably the
single A slice.
On slide number 23, we have the changes in equity. Increase is just a bit south of EUR2
billion and that includes the result for the year. The negative impact of the volatility of
financial markets on the value of investments, which as usual, is partly offset by shadow
accounting.

Bloomberg Transcript

Unlike last year we have negative translation difference because the euro appreciated as I
said before, against the main Latin American currencies, and most of the change is in
other items where we have the about EUR1.8 billion of minorities.
In Banco do Brasil, the scrip dividend which was a further positive amount of about EUR170
million, and they were compensated by the decreasing minority shareholders as a result
of the acquisition of the 12.5% in MAPFRE Internacional.
Lastly, slide 24, we have the financing structure. As a direct result of the lower leverage
and increase in equity we see that the total weight of equity has gone up to about 85% of
total financing and interest coverage and leverage ratio are extremely strong. We have
nearly 37 times interest coverage and 15% leverage, which are consistent with high AA or
even AAA ratings and are clearly at odds with the ratings bestowed on us by some
agencies. And this would be all on my side and I'll give back the call to Mr. Tejera for the
Q&A.

We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Your first
question comes from Vinit Malhotra of Goldman Sachs. Please ask your question.

FINAL

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon, (Davi). Good afternoon, (inaudible). Just -- I've always
been curious about the Spanish motor business that you have been growing, as you have
pointed out, faster than market, and if I go to slide 33, please, we can see that the
whether the market has improved a bit on the motor, you kind of (worth) them in the ninemonth period.
Is there something that we should be thinking about, this faster than market growth
catching up with the combined ratio? Is that something there? So that's the first question
there, please. And the second question is, again, (inaudible) on MAPFRE FAMILIAR,
properties seem to have fairly strong improvement in the Fourth Quarter. Was anything
there that we should know? All right. Thank you very much -- in combined ratios, I mean.
Thank you.

A - Luis Davila

{BIO 16121079 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi. Good afternoon. Well no, the two things in the first -- regarding the first question,
these two things do not go hand in hand because that is a trend -- the growth trend is
something that we have seen throughout the year. It was not seen just in the last quarter.
The last quarter we just had a higher loss ratio. It happens, it usually -- year-on-year tends
to be an even figure or a figure with not massive change but we have seen in other
quarters variation of this kind. It happens from time to time. It was also relatively normal at
year end when you review there, so there's nothing which we have not seen in previous
quarters in other years. Property -- you're right, and it was due to a sales campaign which
took place in the last quarter.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

A - Luis Davila

Your next question comes from Giulia Raffo of Autonomous Research. Please ask your
question.

Q - Giulia Raffo

{BIO 7573856 <GO>}

Hi. Good afternoon. I have a few questions. A couple are a bit boring on numbers but one
would be helpful if on the (Vova) asset that you talk about for the other intangible, if you
can give us a sense of what is the minority share of that EUR2.45 billion item so that when

FINAL

we calculate your tangible book value after minorities we can attribute this other
intangible correctly.
The second question is a follow-up from what Vinit was asking. I understand that there are
fluctuation between one quarter and the other, but if we look at the combined ratio
progression in your Spanish motor, there has been quite a sharp deterioration in Q3 and
Q4. The first half you were running at 95%, and then you had Q3 at 96%, and now Q4 at
99%.
Was there anything particular in the quarter or perhaps at the end of the year when you
look at the initial loss peak that you took on the first three quarters, you thought that
perhaps more conservative was necessary.
And my other question is on the dividend side, as far as I understand, you have the
intention to pay the dividend in cash. Now, is there anything that could happen between
now and the AGM that might change your view on that, and specifically I was wondering
whether you can give us any update on the Bankia relationship.
And finally, on the motor, I believe there has been some news on the (Baremo) so I was
wondering whether you can give us some first comment on what you would expect for
2012 and whether we should expect any indication from that, in your motor business loss
ratio. Thanks. Thank you very much.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Esteban Tejera

{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

Hi, Giulia. Esteban. I prefer to answer first the question on dividends and our relationship
with Bankia. As you have said, our policy is to pay in cash and unless something happens
from here to the payment of March that implies a new operation or new necessities after
increasing our capital and or continuing our solvency, we will pay in cash, the dividend.
In terms of the restructuration of the Bankia, base have -- and base were -- we can see
hear all types of rumors and information possible to foresee what will happen. I think that
Bankia is a great franchise and from the point of view of MAPFRE, and from the point of
view of insurance we have -- our news is that the government has approved a delay of
two years in the application of the law that established that every -- each bank will have
only one partner in insurance.
So there will be -- in any case, independently of what will happen in the map of the
financial situation in Spain due to merger for acquisitions or changes of the property, we
are secure we have two years to fix the situation if this situation changes in a significant
way, so I am sorry for not having more information. That is not available at the moment,
but the good news for us is this that we can maintain our (calm) in the design, the
position, just in case it is necessary. Any further questions?

A - Luis Davila

{BIO 16121079 <GO>}

No, no. The one on dividend, then Bankia.

Q - Giulia Raffo

{BIO 7573856 <GO>}

Yes. Yes. No. I think it is clear. You can't -- at this stage you don't know whether something
will happen in the next six weeks but it doesn't -- we'll see. At the end of the day, that's
clear.

A - Luis Davila

{BIO 16121079 <GO>}

Okay. In terms of the Vova -- roughly it's about EUR1.2 billion, the amount. Regarding
whether there was conservativism in reserves, I suppose you can say so. We've tried to
value them prudently based on how we see expected trends in the market going forward
into 2012.

Q - Giulia Raffo

{BIO 7573856 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I guess what I was trying to check is whether it was too optimistic -- the 95% that we saw
in the first half and perhaps equally it is wrong to extrapolate on the 99% in Q4 -- the full
year view of 96% is more of a proxy.

A - Luis Davila

{BIO 16121079 <GO>}

I would say so. As I said before, it's not the first time we see. Quarterly trends are what
they. Quarters are quarters. The yearly figure is much more of a benchmark to go awry
and we've seen in previous years spikes and falls of similar amount. It happens, so on a
quarterly basis it does happen.
As far as the Baremo is concerned, we have a new director general of the supervisory
authority and she said that she expects, quote, News in 2012. As far as the industry is
concerned, we have -- are letting the supervisor and the ministry know that we'd rather
have it sooner than later, because we'd much rather have a clear framework to operate in
but that's as much as we can tell you. We don't know where it's going to happen. The
director general has said that she expects news but that's as much as we can tell you.

Q - Giulia Raffo

{BIO 7573856 <GO>}

Okay. Just one quick thing -- sorry, I forgot to ask before. On slide 20, out of the held to
maturity on your fixed income, the EUR1.767 billion, is there any of that which is either
Portugal or Greece within the EUR1.8 billion?

A - Luis Davila

{BIO 16121079 <GO>}

Yes. It's primarily Latin America.

Q - Will Hardcastle

{BIO 16346311 <GO>}

Hi, there. It looks like you've increase your provision in the quarter for the financial market
instability despite the additional Greek write-down. Can you explain what specific
concerns have driven that increase and also maybe touch on the level of impairment your
Greek debt write-down implies?

And the final question is on (Gerais Segurta), it looks like you've increased the reserves
due to regulatory changes -- could you maybe just touch on what those changes were
and how much that has actually impacted? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Luis Davila

{BIO 16121079 <GO>}

Hi, Will. Good afternoon. Well I think it's obvious the reason for which the provision was
increased anyway. It wasn't a dramatic amount compared to the stock that was already
appropriated in June. It's clearly uncertainty and the reason for which the provision is
appropriated. I'm afraid there's no better answer than that one. Prudence -- call it
prudence -- whatever you want.
Roughly Greece is at 50% of its nominal value, on the books, roughly.
And last question, Gerais Segurta -- I'm afraid the precise change in regulation, do you
know it, is it --

A - Jesus Amadori Carrillo

{BIO 17699282 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, sir. Hi, this is Jesus Admadori. There was a change in our resource policy, basically
part of the expenses -- expense policy that can be attributed to (Ibenar) has been
changed, and also led the industry to provision more in that precise reserve. Obviously,
the precise impact we cannot tell you, because that's non-confidential, but obviously the
results would have been much more in line with premium development.

A - Luis Davila

{BIO 16121079 <GO>}

Unfortunately, in Turkey there have been some comings and goings in terms of the
regulation on reserve so we've had -- if my memory does not fail me, we had a positive
impact last year and negative impact this year. There's been a bit of swings. That's the
reality.

Yes. Good afternoon to everybody. I have a few questions. First of all, regarding your
Spanish motor business, I saw that the average premium paid by customers declined
5.5% compared to the past years, and this trend is the first time after two, three years
that there is a decline of the average premium paid by customers. So I wonder if this is a
trend that concerns you and if this explains why there was a slight reiteration in the last
part of the year in the motor business?

My second question is in regards the expense ratio. Do you think that we will see some
improvement in the expense ratio, so some expenses in 2011 like the launch of Verti are
not -- will not be repeated in 2012.

FINAL

And my third question is in regards to the tax rate. Do you expect any increase in tax rate
in next year, given also I think that the weight of the Brazilian operation are increasing and
am I correct the tax rate there is around 40%?
And final question regarding the (re-sovereign) offering is slide 63 -- I appreciated that
you disclosed the data regarding the run-up, I wondered if the numbers -- the figures you
give in the number 63 are on the net premiums so the combined effect, or on the final
reserve (built) in the -- at the end of the year, and if you can provide us in the future, also,
the triangle evolution? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi Atanasio. Many questions. Let's see. The decrease in the average premium per
customer is fundamentally due to two reasons. The main one is the fact that we have an
economic slowdown and so there's two trends. We have fewer policies from new
business so the policies in the portfolio age and people, when the policies age, usually
tend to reduce their covers.
And secondly this is compounded by the fact that because of the prices, people can
afford to pay less money for their insurance premiums so they down shift. They reduce
the number of covers, not because the car gets older but simply because they cannot pay
as much. So that is fundamentally the reason for the decrease in the premium per
customer which have seen -- believe it's a trend we've just seeing throughout the year.
And you say this is the first year but I think we already saw that --

Q - Atanasio Pantarrotas

{BIO 5933123 <GO>}

No. The first since 2008 -- the end of 2008, beginning of 2009, so it's the first.

A - Luis Davila

{BIO 16121079 <GO>}

Yes. Yes.

Q - Atanasio Pantarrotas

{BIO 5933123 <GO>}

There was some recovery in late '09 and beginning of '10 of the --

A - Luis Davila

{BIO 16121079 <GO>}

Then to a smaller extent, Verti. Verti, by its very nature is a company that in terms of price
positioning is stays at the level which is below the average amount for premium and Verti
has had to relatively a large contribution is 67,000 policies in its first year. It's not an
immense amount of the total policy stock of MAPFRE but it also has an impact.

FINAL

The expenses of Verti -- clearly we expect them to have gradually a smaller influence of
the total -- over a total amount because clearly as the premiums grow, there is going to
be less sales. In terms of the rest of the trends, somehow the question on expenses
connects to the question on the tax rate.
The more we have an increase in the weight of the foreign, both the expense ratio and
the tax rate tends to go up. You've seen that in MAPFRE America. If you look at MAPFRE
America we have seen quite a material swing between the loss ratio and the expense
ratio and that is because the business is now coming through Banco do Brasil -- has a
better loss ratio and clearly there is a flip side on the expense ratio.
We also have a growing volume of broker intermediated business on the commercial
side, which also has an impact of this, so as a trend -- clearly as these businesses are
growing weight, it does have a bearing on the expense ratio and the tax ratio -- you're
absolutely right.
Clearly with Brazil having a larger weight, we do have an upward trend. If the US, by the
way, also were to go up because the US really this year was banged hard on the head by
catastrophes, the US also has a tax rate which is higher than Spain so if they were, as we
expect them and hope that no such catastrophes appear, at least not to the same extent
in 2012, then also we would pressure the tax rate up.

Your next question comes from (Mattheo Vasilovich) of Morgan Stanley. Please ask your
question.

Q - Mattheo Vasilovich
Oh, hi, it's Mattheo here from Morgan Stanley. Unfortunately I want to focus a little bit on
the negatives just to get to some comfort around those issues. In terms of impairments,
my first question is on Commerce Group. I realize last year was a bad year for Commerce
Group for reasons other than fundamental, underlying performance but nevertheless
there's been several bad years in a row on Commerce Group.

FINAL

I'm just wondering how close you came to triggering a goodwill impairment on that part of
the business? The second question I had on the land impairments that you've had. I
understand that you've taken about a 20% overall over time impairment on the regional
INMUEBLES portfolio.
I was just wondering, if this is vacant land and it's valued at 20% less than it was a couple
of years ago, is it possible for you guys to jus offload it at the price that you're currently
valuing it at on your balance sheet, because obviously it's not yielding anything in terms of
income so it would be better to just offload it at the price that's on the balance sheet, if
that price is achievable, and the final question is just one of fact. I'm just wondering on
your portfolio of equities, what level of impairments did you take in 4Q and how much
unrealized gains do you have on equity still in your shareholders equity?

A - Luis Davila

{BIO 16121079 <GO>}

Okay, Mattheo. Good afternoon. Let's see. No. In commerce we have not come close to
an impairment. I mean, these are figures which I reviewed with the auditors and if they
had -- impairment there is or there is not. That is the fact, so it has been reviewed with
the auditors and the auditors have not demanded any impairment, which means that the
valuations hold. That's the long and short of it.

Bloomberg Transcript

Why do we not offload the land in INMUEBLES? We value it, actually, once again -- the
auditors require quite extensive test of the valuations of a very large sample of stock, so
the valuations we are comfortable with and it -- and the auditors also require that it is
appraised by external valuators so we're reasonably safe there.
I suspect that if we got a decent offer, as we do with buildings from time to time -- if
someone comes along and makes us an offer for land we could sell it but this is a
moment in which you have to be careful about selling whatever is property in Spain. So it
depends. If there is a good opportunity, why not, but unless we find it I wouldn't say we
would be rushing to dispose of these properties.
And the last question on the impairment of equities -- I'm afraid I don't have that answer
for you. But since you're asking me exactly what impairment it was in the last quarter on
equities?

Q - Mattheo Vasilovich
Yes, because you have a EUR1 billion in equities and the markets were quite weak, at least
in 3Q last year. I don't think you took large impairments in 3Q from what --

A - Luis Davila

{BIO 16121079 <GO>}

It's not a matter of impairments. We had a third value strike with this so whatever is the
value, they are recognizing equity for their value.

Q - Mattheo Vasilovich

Page 15 of 26



Company N ame: M apfre SA

FINAL

Yes, I guess the question is whether or not they'll eventually flow through the P&L, and
that will depend whether or not you've got unrealized gains on them still, so I was just
wondering whether or not we can expect in 1Q or 2Q, if the market stays where it is,
further impairments on equities or whether we're relatively secure that that won't happen
if the market stays where it is at this level?

A - Luis Davila

{BIO 16121079 <GO>}

Well I suspect that would apply only to equities which suffer a very deep and prolonged
decrease in price, and then we've had that. The one I can recall was the deterioration with
the impairment we did last year with Cattolica, but otherwise the -- it has to be 18 months
and 40% continuous for which usually is only in very limited cases.
At any rate, this is what I'm saying. Whatever impairment there is, is in equity. There's -our equity reflects the value -- our shareholders' equity reflects the value of our equity
investments in the market at any time.

Q - Mattheo Vasilovich
Okay. Great, thank you very much for that. Thank.

Q - Frederico Salerno
Good afternoon. Just a couple of things. The first question I have is on the dividend
reinvestment plan. I browsed the presentation. I couldn't see any mention of it, so I was
wondering if you plan to implement one going forward for this year or not. Then the
second, on the property portfolio, besides INMUEBLES I had realized gains of roughly

Hi, Frederico. As I have said to Giulia before, our policy is paying in cash. The only changes
in this could happen if we have something to acquire and I don't foresee anything now.
There is nothing I can say to you. As I have said before, from the point of view of the
operations in the Banco do Brasil's business and so on, there is a situation where enough
things are moving but I don't think that these moving along will happen in the near future
and we will be very prudent in these kind of thinks in the future.
A few mainly because our strategic position from the geographical point of view is okay,
so the policy is paying in cash. The only thing that could change this policy is one specialty
opportunity happens, and I don't foresee at the moment.

(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Marcus Rivaldi of Morgan Stanley.
Please ask your question.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Marcus Rivaldi

{BIO 5739374 <GO>}

Good afternoon, everybody. And so I'll just come back to the property questions again,
and of course all your presentations here today are on IFRS accounting for these assets
but if we're looking across in the banking space at the moment, we've got a regulator
who's the Bank of Spain asking banks to take a very different approach to how they may
make marks on properties going forward to sort of restore confidence in the Spanish
banking system.
So are you getting similar -- sort of having similar discussions with your regulator as well
about your property assets. First of all, if you could just clarify to what extent some of
those unrealized gains of balance sheet are actually included in your regulatory solvency
position and may just extend on from that to maybe discussion around whether there's
been any read across from we're seeing from the Bank of Spain to the insurance sector.
Thank you.

A - Luis Davila

{BIO 16121079 <GO>}

Hi, Marcus. The last part of the -- so let's imagine I may not, at this point, be able at this
point to give you a precise figure. We're looking into that now. For real estate, generally
speaking for investments -- insurance balance sheets are much more solid than insurance
balance sheets of banks because our valuations on asset are much closer to market than
those of banks.

Page 17 of 26



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2012-02-08

FINAL

None here is an expert on banking accounting but somehow the way real estate assets
have been valued in the banking industry in Spain resembles some sort of an embedded
value approach. There is a certain inclusion in the value of the properties of expected
future profits flowing from the property. Ours is market. We take the properties, have a
surveyor assess their value in the market and tell us you are below or above that, and if
you are below you have to appropriate a provision.
So it's -- let's say it's a much tougher valuation approach than the one used in insurance,
so what happens on the banking side does not necessarily have an impact on what
happens on the insurance side. And roughly 6% of the positive amounts in the sovereignty
margin come from unrealized gains in property.

Q - Marcus Rivaldi

{BIO 5739374 <GO>}

So just to clarify, the EUR600 million that you're referring to, the off balance sheet -- only
6 points of the solvency margin is coming from that source.

A - Luis Davila

{BIO 16121079 <GO>}

Yes.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Marcus Rivaldi

{BIO 5739374 <GO>}

Okay. And just to be clear, again, and obviously the Bank of Spain is maybe asking banks
to take a closer look at maybe that approach to how they account for those assets going
forward, and there may be potential impacts on valuations in the market. Have you
thought about maybe making some general provisions against that as of this stage?

A - Luis Davila

{BIO 16121079 <GO>}

Once again, thank you for asking this because this is a popular question we receive. I am
sometimes under the impression that with this and with our financial investments,
somehow we improvise in the valuation. We have clear deadlines to go about when we
value the assets and our valuation is to take the assets.
We are actually required by the auditors to provide evidence of market valuation of those
as well as by regulations, and that's the approach we follow. It's not as if we fancy a
percentage, write it down and apply that. We have some guidelines that we follow and
this year -- and I must tell you we were extensively tested because as you can imagine,
the auditors at this time in history want to be double -- want to make face that they have
the valuations under control before the signoff.
So I'm afraid that's the way it works. We have an approach and we follow it. You know, if
next year there is a new prevailing wisdom of how these assets have to be valued and
then that leads to percentage X then percentage X will be applied, but this year that's the
approach that was followed.

Company N ame: M apfre SA

No. I appreciate that. And obviously there was an approach or obviously just the Bank of
Spain changed is really sort of (inaudible) probably since you closed the books for the
year end, just wondering whether -- how that's -- maybe you're thinking about --

FINAL

A - Luis Davila

{BIO 16121079 <GO>}

I imagine what you're saying is that if the approach by the Bank of Spain translates into a
new market valuation, if it does then possibly, yes, it will have an impact even that we go
by market valuation, but it's not a direct impact, given that the Bank of Spain requires such
valuation then the GS, which is the insurance supervisor, will do the same because to
begin with, the way assets are valued is different. So the Bank of Spain has to fix troubles
which the insurance sector does not have.

Your next question comes from Giulia Raffo. Please ask your question.

Q - Giulia Raffo

{BIO 7573856 <GO>}

Hi, sorry. Just to follow up on numbers detail actually. On the EUR600 million unrealized
gains on property on page 56, can you give us a sense of how much belonged to
minorities because the scope has changed greatly with the Brazilian transaction, so I just
wanted to understand as to what would be the minority share of that?
Then just the final detail -- am I right in thinking when I look at slide number 59 where you
show the profit breakdown by unit, the Greek impairment has all affected the line called
Other companies and consolidation adjustments, so which is to say the result of FAMILIAR,
Empresas, et cetera have not been impacted by Greek impairment. If that is not correct,
could you give us the detail of the Greek impairment by the main units? Thank you.

A - Luis Davila

{BIO 16121079 <GO>}

We have not actually disclosed the figure but it's negligible, the share of minorities in
those unrealized gains, so by and large they're all of the main shareholder. You can take
them to be fundamentally of the main shareholder. The impairment in Greece was, let's
say, complex in terms of the assessment. There is some in their line, and some in the lines
of companies, but primarily there's a big chunk in the other companies' line, yes, but it's
also in the company, at the company's level.

Q - Luis Pena

{BIO 15131020 <GO>}

Oh, okay. So I have different questions. Well first in follow-up. I apologize because I joined
late and somewhat the questions might have been answered already, so the first one is
on Bankia and if you can give us some sort of information on how the situation is evolving
regarding the bank assurance agreement of Bancaja and whether that -- whether you
would be interested in acquiring or being a partner of Bankia in this division network?
The second one is if you can give us an outlook for the international business this year,
especially in the US, Turkey, and Latin America. So how do you see actually (payment)
growth and the combined ratio evolving in these geographies.
And finally, regarding the one-offs. Okay. So MAPFRE had very significant negative and
positive one-offs in 2011. On the negative one-offs I think that we could see again some
sort of continuation of negative one-offs, especially in property with potentially some
financial impairments, so the question is will we see again the positive one-offs in 2012,
and what could be the sources of positive one-offs, if you are foreseeing any? Thank you.

A - Esteban Tejera

{BIO 3910673 <GO>}

I had said before, regarding Bankia that we remain with Bankia as main partners. We don't
know how we like Bankia in the next months in order to make or not new acquisitions for
mergers, et cetera.
But I said before that the changes in the regulation approved last week give us two
additional years to establish the final composition of our joint ventures with Bankia and the
other partners, which means that in the meantime we can have our agreement with
Page 21 of 26



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2012-02-08

FINAL

Bankia in current terms and Bankia has the way to maintain their position in the JV that is
coming from Bancaja, they could maintain it.
So from this point of view, we must wait and see what happens in the financial evolution
during the next months and our intention and vocation is to be the main partners of
Bankia now and in the future, but for doing that we have more time now that we have in
the situation of the old regulation that are banks and insurance company to agree to
remain with only one partner. This is the main difference now.
From the point of view of our -- for the other question about the evolution of the
international business, while in the USA, in commerce, and especially we have had this
year, it's been a very bad year from the point of view of catastrophes. I remind you that
we have to see where there are no storms of the year, then we had the hurricanes.

Bloomberg Transcript

We had the kind of catastrophes that never had occurred in the State of Massachusetts
before. I hope that this will not happen this year and we have to increase our tariffs twice
during the year, and there is an increase of more than 4% in local currency of the gross
premium in commerce. Commerce is working very well from the point of view of the
current business and I think that this is a company that is working in the way that MAPFRE
works usually, and in the branches that we are specialists, so not fully maintained but we
are gaining market share in Massachusetts and we are starting to develop business in
other states.
And in Turkey the situation is similar. We have these new regulations that were
commentative before about the calculation of provisions in Turkey but we have to suffer
the evolution of the currency against the euro, but in local currency the growth is very
important and last year in the situation from the point of view of profitability of the
company, even if the competition there is very hard.
It's improving and we are starting to develop our scheme, open new home branches in
the territory that will give us organical growth in the next years in the way that we did
before in Latin America, so we are very comfortable in the international business. And I
hope that the catastrophe side this year will be better than the year before.

A - Luis Davila

{BIO 16121079 <GO>}

And as far as the last question is concerned, Luis, one-offs by their very nature are
unexpected figures so both the positive and negative we just have no idea about. It's
something that we adjust for as if and if they happen. For the moment, clearly at the
outset of the year and there's nothing that I can think of which is not already reflected in
the 2011 accounts.

the level of reserve release?
Concerning your activity, I'd like to have a view of the gross in Suisse America at the same

of this good loss ratio? Is it sustainable?

FINAL

A - Luis Davila

{BIO 16121079 <GO>}

Okay, Patrick. Before I answer your question, I would just like to say to the participants is I
apologize. We are actually glad to receive so many questions but we actually have to
catch a flight to London to continue this conversation tomorrow, so I'm afraid we'll -- if you
don't mind this will be the last questions we answer.
Now, Patrick, in terms of the quality of reserving -- one of the participants made reference
to the table on slide number 63 which slows the run of our reserves, which is positive
consistently over the last eight years so that is the -- I believe the answer to your question.

Bloomberg Transcript

We also have our reserves reviewed externally on a yearly basis by actuarial consultants
and if the reserves are insufficient we would have to make -- if they were insufficient we
would have to make additional provisions and that would be reflected in the notes to our
accounts and to my memory, that has never happened, at least since I've been with
MAPFRE, so the quality of reserving this year is very much the same as it was last year.
In Latin America -- you're right. Clearly there is such a large addition. If my memory
doesn't fail me, excluding Banco do Brasil, the increase is about 11%. That has an element
which comes from Venezuela and Argentina where we've consciously decided to contain,
let's say, our growth because we are not comfortable with the underwriting terms in the
market and with the quality of the business that can be written so it does have a bearing
on the total growth of the business.
Anyway, you will find a detailed breakdown of the growth by country on -- which I believe,
if you're asking that question you already looked at, but anyway also for the benefit of the
other participants, you have it on slide number 41. And excluding Venezuela, and just
Argentina, Puerto Rico, you have growth of 16% in Mexico, 22% in Colombia, 25% in Chile,
16% in Peru -- these are respectable growth rates, so -- but Venezuela and Argentina,
indeed, if you adjust them for the inflation it leads to a decrease and that's because we
believe we have to be extra prudent on the business we write.
In MAPFRE VIDA, you're right. If you adjust for CatalunyaCaixa, there is a fall in there. It is
due to the fact that the Casa Madrid Bankia has sold a lower amount of premiums in 2011
that they did in 2010. 2011 was an especially delicate year for the Spanish banking system
and especially delicate for savings banks and banks coming from savings banks, so there
was an intense competition for deposits and there was a need for banks to focus on
deposit taking so that in this case, and in the case of (inaudible) had a bearing on the
sales of the life assurance.
The most pressure year, you're right. The year was an especially good one and actually
was very good. In terms of, let's say, call it direct -- call it ordinary or non-catastrophe
insurance -- it's difficult to make exact predictions about the loss ratio. One company
comes to my mind, which is the commercial insurance business in Spain, MAPFRE

Empresas, which actually -- fortunately or unfortunately, depending on the way you look at
it -- because of the slowdown in the economy had lower frequency and lower severe.
The economy doesn't seem to be about to spring up again so then they continue in 2012.
The Brazilian has, by nature, a lower loss ratio than the Latin American business before
the business with Banco do Brasil, so that also pressures the loss ratio downward but then
there are the known unknowns. I cannot tell you exactly how the loss ratio will come out in
2012, seen from now.

I'd like to be sure to understand. You said that without Banco do Brasil the growth in South
America would be 11%?

A - Luis Davila

{BIO 16121079 <GO>}

Roughly, because it's EUR1.2 billion in premiums so if you net that out -- MAPFRE America
grossed EUR1.7 billion. If you take out EUR1.2 billion, you're left with half a billion, which
works at about 11%.
