I'm pleased to present the Group result before amortization and write-downs of NOK
2.940 billion for the full year of 2017, and a quarter result of NOK 618 million. The fourth
quarter results is, however, negatively impacted by more than NOK 300 million, which will
strengthen future earnings, capital buﬀers and also our solvency positioning. Lars will
refer to that later on. The underlying solvency positioning is – has improved to 165% in
2017 before transitionals, and 172% including transitionals. The Board proposes a dividend
of NOK 2.50 per share, and we are introducing a more explicit dividend policy for 2018. It
is also pleasing to report strong growth in the Non-guaranteed Savings segment. 2017
saw 20% growth in unit linked, 25% growth in assets under management, resulting from
good sales, good market returns, and acquisition of SKAGEN. Assets acquired from Silver
will be reported from the ﬁrst quarter of 2018.
Let's turn to slide number 3. This is a (26:00) slide illustrating our two-fold strategy, which
have been implemented consistently through the past ﬁve years. It is pleasing to see that
we are really delivering on both sides of the strategy in the fourth quarter, with both
solvency improvements and increased dividends on the one side, combined with strong
growth in assets as well as earnings within the Savings segment in the other side.

Bloomberg Transcript

If you then turn to slide number 4 and let me start with managing the balance sheet.
Storebrand ends 2017 in a robust capital position. The solvency ratio increased 15
percentage points before dividends. The strong solvency improvements are mainly
attributed to capital creation and better capital increases in the Life Insurance division.
The solvency improvement in 2017 is greater than we normally can expect. That indicates
that we are well-positioned for further increases in the solvency ratio combined with
growing dividend.
If you then turn to slide number 5. The Board proposes a dividend of NOK 2.50 per share,
comprising of our ordinary dividend of NOK 2.10 per share and a special dividend of NOK
0.40 per share. This comes as a result of strong ﬁnancial returns and a very positive return
after tax. With this, a cash dividend of 40% of proﬁt after tax, adjusted for amortization.
And for the ﬁrst time in many years, a dividend of NOK 1.3 billion will be paid from the Life
Insurance business through the holding company. This will strengthen the Group liquidity
and dividend paying capacity, while also contributing to reach our goal of a net debt ratio
of zero in the holding company.
If we then move to slide number 6, the new dividend policy. Storebrand's objective is to
create attractive and competitive returns for shareholders through dividends and value
creation in the business. The Board is therefore introducing a more explicit dividend
policy. The goal is to pay out more than 50% of earnings after tax. The ambition is to pay
ordinary dividends of at least the same nominal level as previous years.
If the solvency margin is about 180%, the Board intends to propose special dividends or
share buy backs. The new dividend policy intends to reﬂect the strong growth in feebased earnings, the more volatile ﬁnancial markets-related earnings, and the future
capital release from the guaranteed book.

FINAL

Slide number 7. The strong growth within Savings continues, and it's worth nothing that
assets under management have increased by 25% and is now NOK 721 billion. There's
also a strong growth in unit linked with 17% growth in Sweden and 23% growth in Norway.
And the retail bank has grown by 19% in 2017. And as previously communicated, the
reduced growth within Insurance in 2017 is due to changes in distribution, as well as our
new disability product with regulatory lowered premiums and coverage.
Slide number 8. With the acquisition of SKAGEN, the Group is excellent positions for the
strong growth in the Norwegian individual savings market. If you look at the market for
long-term savings, Storebrand has a strong position in the pension-related parts on the
left-hand side of the slide, in gray, which represents the value chain of pensions. Let me
highlight a modest position within pure mutual funds. With the purchase of SKAGEN, this
is really changed and we expect to have doubled over collective market share to about
28% in these combined markets.
Slide number 9. In the second half of 2017, two new private savings product was
introduced to the market. It was Individual Pensions Savings product, IPS, that is (31:17)
Pensions Savings product with real (31:21), and the equity savings account of
Aksjesparekonto (31:26) for equity mutual funds and equities.

Bloomberg Transcript

Preliminary reports show that Storebrand Group has taken a leading position within the
IPS markets, Storebrand with a market share of 20% and SKAGEN with a market share of
4%. And that's, of course, combined total market share of 24% all altogether.
In the ASK market, SKAGEN's strong position within mutual funds saving is clearly visible.
Combined, the Storebrand Group achieved a market share roughly 22% with the brand
names Storebrand, Delphi, and SKAGEN and ranked as a runner-up in this important
product.
Storebrand's strength within pension savings and SKAGEN's strength in the Savings and
investment segment is a further indication of how our businesses complement each other
and strengthens our positions in the growing Savings segment.
And then, I give the words to Lars.

Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
Thank you, Odd Arild.
Let me start on page 10 regarding key ﬁgures. The numbers we published today are
distorted by the onboarding of SKAGEN and a few special items that I will (32:55). Seeing
through that, the quarter is quite normal. There's continued growth in Non-guaranteed
Savings and with the transition towards capital-light products.
Let's start in upper left-hand corner. The quarterly results came to NOK 618 million. The
operating result includes NOK 590 million from Storebrand and NOK 202 million from
Page 3 of 15

FINAL

SKAGEN. The SKAGEN numbers in this overview are adjusted downwards to reﬂect the
fourth quarter results from SKAGEN.
The operating result in Storebrand is strengthened by the performance fees from Delphi,
but are negatively aﬀected by weak Insurance result and a higher operating cost in the
quarter. The weaker Insurance results in the quarter stem from seasonal factors, as well
certain large disability payments. The full year results, however, are satisfactory; and the
development in the fourth quarter does not change our view on achieved proﬁtability.
When it comes to operating cost, the fourth quarter was impacted by a number of special
issues. These included an extraordinary eﬀort to develop and send the new ASK and IPS
products as described by Mr. Grefstad a moment ago, an internal refurbishing project
which will reduce our oﬃce rent going forward, and also a number smaller expenses,
which are not expected to be repeated in 2018.
Our objective of reducing cost in nominal terms from 2015 to 2018 stands ﬁrm, adjusted
for the SKAGEN acquisition. The SKAGEN results are largely a consequence of
performance fees booked at the end of the year. This means that the result impact from
SKAGEN will be limited in the ﬁrst three quarters every year. The performance fees should
lift the fourth quarter results.

Bloomberg Transcript

Financial return in the quarter had been weak, ﬁrst and foremost as a consequence of
(34:54), which has reduced booked return and portfolios co-invested with the connected
portfolio in the (34:59).
Special items consist primarily of an accounting charge of NOK 200 million for a reduced
discount rate in Sweden. EIOPA, the insurance regulator in Europe, has proposed to the
EU Commission to reduce the UFR, the ultimate forward rate, from 4.2% to 3.65% over the
next three years. In Sweden, we use the Solvency II discount rate for accounting purposes.
By reserving NOK 200 million, we have taken a one-oﬀ charge that addresses the change
in the next three years.
It is important to note that this also reduces the earning (35:41) rate for future returns,
which means that the result will improve by the same amount over time. Other special
items include NOK 10 million in severance pay in Sweden due to a new core IT system
and NOK 30 million in transaction costs related to the acquisitions of SKAGEN and Silver.
On the positive side, we have included the SKAGEN results not attributable to the fourth
quarter, approximately NOK 50 million.
I have mentioned how management decisions in the quarter have signiﬁcantly
strengthened (36:14). This can be seen in the two lower graphs on the page. If we have
included the order values in the bonds (26:23) will actually exceed 12%. This allows us to
manage booked return with a lot of eﬀorts in the years ahead. Earnings per share
adjusted for amortization of intangible assets came to NOK 1.56 for the quarter and NOK
6.47 (36:45) for the full year.

In summary, we have (36:50) that have weakened results by more than NOK 300 million
in the quarter in order to strengthen future proﬁtability and reduce risks.

FINAL

Moving over to page 11. Storebrand solvency position has been strengthened by 5
percentage points in the quarter from 150% to 155%. Including transitionals, the
improvement is 12 percentage points from 160% to 172%.
Let's look at movements in the quarter, starting from the right-hand side. In November, we
issued a subordinated loan of SEK 1 billion. This strengthened the solvency by 3.7%
(37:30). The acquisition of SKAGEN weakened the solvency by just short of 2% this quarter
as previously announced net +2 (37:38).
We have good returns, albeit buﬀers, and made changes in our product portfolio and
asset allocation that, in total, strengthened the solvency by an additional 2 percentage
points.

Bloomberg Transcript

The accounting results in the – for the Group after tax of approximately NOK 0.5 billion
conﬁgures an additional 2 percentage points, and – while reduced rates and a lower
volatility adjustment conﬁgures the negative 2 percentage points. We continuously reﬁne
our modeling and our model assumption, and this has hit the solvency by 2 percentage
points in the quarter.
Also, the transitional grew signiﬁcantly in the quarter. This is largely explained by the
same factors I've already mentioned. Reduced rates (38:27) increases the value of our
liabilities. Furthermore, more precise NFSA assumptions also increased liabilities in the
Solvency II. As the transitionals exist to bridge the diﬀerence in liabilities under Solvency I
and Solvency II, they increase with higher Solvency II liabilities.
Moving over to the following page 12. This picture shows the movement from the third
quarter to the fourth quarter, and the sensitivities to market movements going forward.
The sensitivities increased somewhat compared to the third quarter. Interest-sensitive tax
assumptions increased sensitivity as proﬁtable (39:14) and interest rates increase and they
stay unproﬁtable if rates fall.
Moving over to page 13. Fee and administration income is signiﬁcantly up in the quarter
including NOK 294 million from SKAGEN. Adjusted for this, the growth is 5% year-onyear, which is a combination of 13% growth in the front book and the (39:42) products,
and a 5% decline in the Guaranteed. The Insurance result is in line with last year. The
operational cost line is up, but this includes both the operational cost in SKAGEN as well
as a transaction cost from the acquisition of SKAGEN and Silver. In addition, remaining
costs were high, as explained a few minutes ago.
Going forward, the total quarterly cost levels of Storebrand, including SKAGEN, should be
just below NOK 1 billion. I repeat that our (40:15) for 2018 is, of course, will be nominally
lower than 2015, excluding SKAGEN.

FINAL

For those of you who follow us closely, you will have to take that the historical ﬁgures have
increased a little. This is caused by a poor net use of elimination principles across the
Group and increased (40:38) income by NOK 14 million for the quarter and NOK 58
million for the full year 2017. The change does not impact the results. This change is also
further explained on our IR web pages.
(40:54) items are negatively impacted by the NOK 200 million eﬀect from the discount
change in Sweden and the NOK 51 million run-oﬀ from SKAGEN. The fact that the fourth
quarter results in SKAGEN initiated in run-oﬀ is very positive. It means its customers,
employees and owners made a good return last year.
Amortization increased to NOK 237 million in the quarter. The primary reason is that we
have to calculate the netted result for SKAGEN as of the acquisition date, November 13
(41:29). This has not been amortizing the accounts. Going forward, amortizations at
Storebrand will [Technical Diﬃculty] (41:35) at approximately NOK 100 million per quarter
including both remaining amortizations or intangibles from the acquisition of SPP in 2007
and the SKAGEN acquisition.

Bloomberg Transcript

The negative tax charge or tax income, if you want, in the quarter is a result of the sale of
two large properties as well as a reduction in the general corporate tax level in Norway.
On the negative side, we have reserved for a possible additional tax charge for the year
2015, and further explanation are in the notes.
Then, ﬁnally, I'm going to retouch on page 14 as this may help (42:19) how the SKAGEN
acquisition aﬀected the accounts in the quarter. This, we try to explain here. Fee and
administration income increased by NOK 294 million. The amount is largely caused by
performance fees booked at the end of the year. The operating cost from SKAGEN is NOK
41 million and reﬂects the costs (42:38) since the acquisition.
The ﬁnancial result is minus NOK 45 million, including positive contribution from SKAGEN
of NOK 6 million and the run-oﬀ cost of NOK 51 million. The amortization charge is, as
explained, related to the purchase price analysis and reﬂects estimated results as per the
date of acquisition. Finally, with the tax (43:03) contributions of Storebrand of NOK 33
million, more than enough to pay transaction expenses.
The lower tax table shows SKAGEN results for the quarter in 2017. It documents my
previous comments about limited results in the ﬁrst three quarters, and then in reﬂect of
performance fees in the fourth quarter. The table also shows that there is some volatility in
the numbers. The quarterly cost is driven by estimated bonuses on performance fees
where the actual performance fees can only be booked in the oﬃcial counts at the end of
the year. We will, of course, disclose both.
And this concludes my comments, and we are – we will open up for questions.

Thank you. And we already have two questions coming through. The ﬁrst one is from
Jonny Urwin from UBS. Please go ahead, your line is now open.

FINAL

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Hi, guys. And thanks for taking my questions. Just two for me please. So, ﬁrstly, the new
dividend policy looks to be calibrated on the solvency ratio with transitional measures.
However, I just noted from the presentation, you also meant – you also mentioned that
ordinary dividends are subject to a sustainable solvency margin of above 150%. When we
think of a sustainable basis, I would imagine that's sort of based on the ex-transitional
ratio to be prudent, and if you could get some detail on what sustainability above 150%
means, is that based on the ex-transitional or with the transitional, please?
Secondly, the ordinary dividend. So, this is obviously a beat on the (44:53) dividends,
including the special, but the ordinary components are a bit lower. I just wonder, does
that signal a bit of caution from you guys around the outlook, given you've introduced the
ratchets on the ordinary dividend, (45:06) there? Any comment is much appreciated.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

I can comment on the ﬁrst one. When I look at the solvency ratios, we are talking about
the solvency ratios including the transitionals, but we also expect, of course, that the
transitionals will be reduced over time. So, our internal managing is very much without
the transitionals. But the numbers you can look at when you are looking at the dividend
policy is including transitionals.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
On the second question with special dividends and ordinary dividends, as it states in the
dividend policy and our ambitions that, as Mr. Grefstad mentioned earlier, the ordinary
dividends reﬂects the capital-light growth and results from the front book. While this year
had very good ﬁnancial results due to good ﬁnancial markets, as well as a very low tax
charge, which made the results this year good, and we have therefore decided to pay out
an additional dividend reﬂecting the additional value creation after tax that was created in
(46:33).

Thank you very much. Yeah, I guess the ﬁrst one was a bit of an expansion on Jonny's
question. I mean, when I'm looking at the dividend that you've declared or you're posing,
it's just transcribed with both the policies. I guess if you look at – on the existing policy,
then it seems to be, on my numbers, quite a bit less than the 35%. So, I'm just – I guess
you're already looking forward a little bit. But on the new policy, you talked about specials
and buy backs applying when the solvency ratio is over 180%. I guess now you've paid a
special when it's not there, but to reﬂect the strong ﬁnancial results. So, I guess my
question is, should we also expect sort of specials in the future when we have strong oneoﬀ results even though we're below 180%?
And could you give us a little bit of thinking in terms of what you're thinking of specials? I
mean, if the solvency ratio did develop very strongly over the coming quarters and you're
up 190%, would that signal a very large buy back or would you, I mean, (48:06) feel for
the magnitude perhaps of any specials we might expect? I'm sorry that was rather a long
question.
And then the second one was on the tax one-oﬀs, which I guess becoming quite a regular
occurrence. Can you give us any guidance as to whether we should expect these on an
ongoing basis, whether you've got more potential properties sources? Any sort of
guidance on an underlying tax rate that you might expect would be very helpful? Thank
you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
Thank you. I'll start with the dividend. I think, ﬁrst of all, it's a very clear statement from the
Board that they will give additional capital back to the shareholders, so that is really clear
statement here. Then if you look at the 2017, we used this year (49:01) strong increase in
dividend, but also to meet the long-term target of our net debt ratio of zero in the holding
company, and that is both now a top list with the dividend we did this year. That is also
well above the dividend policy we had for 2017.
Looking forward, of course, it's the new dividend policy that comes into action. And yes,
you should expect if there is a special good ﬁnancial results in the markets or there is
quite positive special element, that we will give a special dividend.
Again, the Board will return additional capital to the shareholders going forward. But what
we try to do here is to show that there is one capital stream from the fee-based business.
There is one possible capital stream from ﬁnancial elements and other elements that is
more (50:02) in the balance sheet. And, of course, over time, we have important capital
stream from the release of the capital from the Guaranteed backlog. So, in that way, you
can say, it's more or less two elements in the extra dividends going forward.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Yeah. On the tax side, Peter, we've said that we expect the tax rate from 19% to 23% for
2018 as we did for 2017. As you know, if we sell properties that releases tax increasing
temporary diﬀerences from our balance sheet, that has become the tax income on the
P&L; and if that happens, that will reduce the tax cost, but there's no (50:54) or properties

Page 8 of 15

or anything like that in eﬀect (50:59) but if that occurs, that will lower the expected tax
cost.

line is now open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Good afternoon. I've got a few questions. Firstly, just looking at
operational factors, the performance of SKAGEN funds themselves, could you maybe
comment on how that has progressed and whether the degree of performance fees
coming through in Q4 is something you would expect on a normalized basis? Also, just
on the dividend policy, just intrigued slightly as to why you chose the earnings deﬁnition
after the amortization, which is clearly a non-cash item, it seemed rather odd to me?
Finally, just on the solvency – eﬀect of solvency range that you seem to have hand in,
which I'd say was between 150% and 180% just given some of the comments you've
made. It doesn't seem a particularly wide range given some of the volatility that we've
seen in the past. I wonder if you'd just comment on that. Thank you.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Thank you, Blair. Starting with SKAGEN, of course we have been seeing a development in
SKAGEN where you have had some outﬂow in the past, that is also the case in 2017 and
that is very much on the institutional side of the SKAGEN business. But when you look at
the recent markets, especially in Norway, you've seen strong development during 2017 in
ﬂow in SKAGEN.
When you look at the – it's a mixed picture when you look at performance fees in the
diﬀerent mutual funds in 2017. And I will say that we expect some, of course, plan for
having even stronger performance fees going forward. But altogether, I think the results
we have seen in SKAGEN this year is a quite strong results, and the results that we are
satisﬁed with them also is the indications that Lars gave for going forward where you will
see – well, quite low result eﬀects in the ﬁrst three quarter, but then a positive eﬀect from
performance fees in the fourth quarter.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Can I just ask on – Odd Arild, what's your expectation for net ﬂows for SKAGEN over the
next year or two? Do you expect them to remain negative?

FINAL

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
No. The ambition is to have a positive net ﬂow for SKAGEN going forward. There is quite
a limited level of institutional money left in SKAGEN, as we speak. It's mostly on retail
money, but we also have, of course, ambitions, international, both with SKAGEN and with
Storebrand, and there is a very strong incident ﬁgure coming from SKAGEN's set-up
internationally, while our own set of brand management is only in Norway and Sweden.
And, of course, we are planning to leverage on that (54:42) Storebrand and Delphi
(54:45) going forward.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

So, we then move to the dividends. I think it's just a way of making this easier. So, just look
at the bottomline result of the tax, we know that amortization is around NOK 400 million a
year and will be that going forward. So, that is taken into account to give a clear number,
nice number, and to give a dividend payout ratio take on that.
Solvency between 150% and 180%. This was very much the (55:23) we gave in our Capital
Markets Day back in 2015. We, of course, have moved quite signiﬁcantly when it comes to
solvency position from that level of. And when we look at our stresses and so on, we feel
that this is a comfortable level to communicate through and also to communicate the
dividends (55:55).

The next question come from Michelle Ballatore from KBW. Please go ahead, your line is
now open.

Q - Michelle Ballatore
Yes. Good afternoon. I have a question going back to the capital generation. So, at your
Capital Markets Day in 2016, you showed this slide with an expected capital generation,
you expect between 5% and 10% of solvency in terms of capital generation, and then
dividends and other minus 1%, 2%, and a net capital generation of 6%. And then you
mentioned also that the run-oﬀ of guarantee can increase this capital generation up to
more than 10% percentage points. So, in the context of 2017, did you have any impact
from the run-oﬀ of guarantees? I mean, what is the capital generation, how can we split
the capital generation between earnings and the run-oﬀ oﬀ of the guarantees? Thank you.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
If I may start on that question. I think that the capital generation that Odd Arild showed on
the page 4, it's the speciﬁcation of the capital generation in 2017. As you can see there
that from asset return, business mix, and operating earnings. That consists of 18
percentage points all together. It looks very strong ﬁnancial markets in 2017, contributing
positive (57:55). It's actually a more return above what you could expect than a change in
Page 10 of 15



Company Name: Storebrand ASA

Date: 2018-02-07

the business mix, because the change in the business mix is still (58:09) developing in the
wrong direction. We have reached the peak capital when it comes to capital requirement
from back of this year, but – and a substantial release from (58:24) is still some time ahead,
short-time ahead (58:31) on the Capital Markets Day a little more precise information.

FINAL

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

So, I think on the – when you look at the fraction, Michelle, it's more about creating own
funds and FDR (58:43) is quite stable in 2017 compared to 2016. I think it's fair to say also
that the capital generation and the solvency generation, I believe this is in the upper scale
of what we gave him in our Capital Markets Day and with the development we have seen
in the business from that time of.

Great. Thank you.

The next question comes from Paul De'Ath from RBC. Please go ahead, your line is now
open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Paul De'Ath
Yeah. Hello. A couple of questions, please. Firstly, just following up on the answer to that
ASK question and on this issue of peak capital and when the major capital releases start
coming through. Did I hear correctly saying that you're in – not at peak capital just yet? I
thought we'd already got to that point. And is there any change to the expected timing of
the capital releases? That's the ﬁrst question.
And then just second question, just looking again, sorry, going back to the dividend on
the special -the potential for specials over 180 percentage points on the solvency ratio. Is
there any element within your decision-making process as to how you get above 180%?
I'm just looking at the sensitivities on page 12; and interest rates going down increases the
solvency ratio. And so, if we have rates going down signiﬁcantly and then that pushed the
ratio above 180% then presumably that – although you're above 180%, not a great result
for the long-term business? So, does that inﬂuence you somewhat or is it if you're above
180% and then you give some money back? Thanks.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Yeah. Hi, Paul. I'll try to answer the ﬁrst one. There's no change in the communication
around the capital. We are at that level now, I would say, at that level throughout the end
of 2017. And as we've said, it will remain at that level for our back book for some time, and
then start to trail up and release capital. We'll try to spend some time now going through
our projections and operate as (01:01:23) Capital Markets Day and the potential for capital
release, and also we'll be more clear on the estimated timing of that.

Also, it was clear that it's almost sensitive to a lot of elements, but – and especially the
interest rate levels. Such increase in interest rate levels will lead to a situation where the
capital release from the back book will come out. Then on the estimated Solvency II
position, I'm not sure that (01:02:04).

FINAL

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
So, in a situation where you have interest rates decline and you (01:01:13 you will have
more transition rules, so they approach the 180% level, which is the top threshold in the
policy. In that situation, it would be natural to take care all factors into account as the
Board always need to do, and I think, in general, lower interest rates is worse for our type
of business, but (01:02:45) higher interest rates in general are better. And also some of
the transitional rules were already declined in the ﬁrst quarter. So, some of these will
decline according to the rules and the run-oﬀ (01:02:58).

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

But I think also it is fair to say that, of course, the 150% and 180% is guidance, then of
course the Board needs to take a thorough view on an annual basis on the REIT
economics of the business. But this is good guidance, so how we like to do in normal
situations to perform, based on our new policy.

The next questions come from Matti Ahokas from Danske Bank. Please go ahead, your
line is now open.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. A couple of questions for me, please. Firstly, if you could elaborate
a bit more on the disability payments, the large one-oﬀs you mentioned in Insurance,
what exactly were they? And then regarding SKAGEN, if you look at the full year proﬁt
before amortization, the illustrative IFRS ﬁgures you present, NOK 274 million, is the
comparison ﬁgure the NOK 204 million that you presented for 2016, so was the proﬁt
actually up by 30-something percent in 2017 pro forma?

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
Yes, on the (01:04:17), you are completely right. It's much stronger results and
performance in 2017 compared to 2016. I'm very, very glad to see that, of course.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

And on the disability payment, we had – we have one corporation with a quite large
coverage and we had a couple of people being sick, and reserving (01:04:47) in the

quarter. So, it's not something we see as a (01:04:52), but it doesn't impact the quarterly
results as such.

Q - Matti Ahokas

How much was this, Lars, all together in the fourth quarter?

Okay. Yeah. Great. Thanks a lot.

And the next questions comes from Peter Eliot from Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead,
your line is now open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you. Yeah. Just a couple of follow-ups. I think, ﬁrst of all, on the sort of the high
capital requirements from the paid-up policies, I noticed that the paid-up policies
declined by just over NOK 1 billion in the quarter at this time, seemingly driven by the
other, which the note says is transfers between DB and paid-up. I was just wondered if you
could elaborate on what caused that and whether that is a sort of reduction that might be
repeated.
And second question was on the health insurance. I guess we had signiﬁcant run-oﬀ gains
in Q3 and then followed by a slightly worse combined ratio in Q4. Would you say sort of
Q4 is a new normal or do you think there were some one-oﬀs?
And then ﬁnally, just on the solvency sensitivities. I assume it's a typo on the right, actually
where it says that there is a 13 point gain from the transitionals. I think that should be 16 to
172. And could you clarify that the timing of the UFR impact that we're going to see come
through? Thank you.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Yeah. I can start from the ﬁrst one on the paid-up policies. If you look at the development
in the quarter, it's settling down. This is reﬂected by the fact that there is more payouts
and some conversions to paid-up policies (01:06:52) versus the actual guaranteed return
in the portfolio. So, in that sense, it's good to see that the current book is starting to trade
oﬀ. But, of course, we still have some funds left in the deﬁned beneﬁt, which over time will
transfer to the paid-up policy book.

With respect to your second question on health insurance, you will see that this is
classiﬁed health insurance and group life together. The health insurance is growing fast, is
proﬁtable and it's good and there is no signiﬁcant volatility between the quarters.
However, in group life, we had a very strong in the third quarter and we had a weak
quarter in the second quarter – in the fourth quarter. If you take the group life and, for that
matter, health insurance asset books together, look at the (01:07:46) result and divide that
in four, that's the best estimate I can give on future performance in (01:07:51).

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

When it comes to your third question, Peter, regarding the sensitivities on solvency. Yes,
you're correct, it's a typo in that graph. And then the second part of that question, I
missed it, sorry. Could you repeat this?

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Just wanted to clarify how the UFR, the timing of – how we would see the UFR impact in
the solvency ratio?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Yeah. I'm (01:08:28) of the new interest rates curves two days ago. We think (01:08:32) on
the UFR down to 4.05 (01:08:36) , so we think there's upstroke in Q1 2018, (01:08:40) will
be from Q1 2019.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Okay. So, on the risk transition, was that a minus 1 percentage point impact that we'll see
in Q1?

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
Yes.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Yes. I'm actually increasing in terms of transitional (01:09:03) be coming back in the
transitionals.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
Because I know where the UFR (01:09:13).
