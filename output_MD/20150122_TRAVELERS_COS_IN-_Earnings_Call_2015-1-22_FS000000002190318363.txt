MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Gabriella Nawi
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Also in our remarks or responses to questions we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures

Jay S. Fishman
Business Highlights
Net Income and Return on Equity
• As you’ve already seen from our release this morning, we closed out this year with record results
• We achieved record levels of net income per diluted share for both the quarter and the full year of $3.11 and
$10.70 respectively
• Our return on equity and operating return on equity were also very strong in the quarter bringing our full year
return on equity to 14.6% and operating return on equity to 15.5%

Business Strategies
• But just as important is what’s behind those numbers

• Across the organization we couldn’t be more pleased with how we’ve executed on our business strategies,
including:
• Our approach to the marketplace in domestic business insurance
• The introduction of Quantum 2.0 and moving our Personal Insurance business to be better positioned
• The continuing evolution of our International footprint
• And our exceptional positioning in Bond & Specialty insurance

Capital Management Strategy
• Just as important is our capital management strategy
• In 2014, we returned over $4B in capital to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks while still
maintaining our significant balance sheet strength

Financial Strategy
• In reflecting on our performance over the last 10 years, now a decade since the merger, a few things stand out
• When we introduced our long-term financial strategy in 2006, that is creating shareholder value by producing
superior returns driven by building meaningful and sustainable competitive advantages, generating top-tier
earnings and capital substantially in excess of our growth needs and maintaining a balanced approach to
rightsizing capital, and growing book value per share over time, we were confident that it has been successful in
the broader sense beyond our expectations

Operating Income, Share Count, Repurchases and Dividends
• Over these 10 years our cumulative operating income has been approximately $31.6B, and we have reduced
our share count by more than 61%, returning $30.7B to shareholders through repurchases and dividends, an
amount exceeding the then market capitalization of the company
• And we did this while still making investments that were important for our business and acquisitions that
were opportunistic for us along the way

Operating Return on Equity
• Consequently we’ve produced a very strong average annual operating return on equity of 13.3% over that time
• Our shareholders have benefited from superior total returns as shown on page four of the webcast, where you
can see the 1-year, 5-year, and 10-year performance of Travelers compared to other U.S. financial companies
• Obviously we’ve posted top-tier returns, but even looking globally we’ve identified only a small handful of
large financial service companies whose 10-year performance exceeds ours
• We remain optimistic about our ability to successfully execute these strategies
• Our own observation is that the markets in which we do business remain fairly stable

• For the last several years, we have shared with you that while we recognize that we could be wrong, we were
skeptical of the concept of the old-fashioned severe insurance pricing cycle where a bell would go off and
there’d be a few years of very high price increases, and then another bell would go off and there’d be
significant price declines
• Our view was and remains that there are now substantive differences in the way business is conducted that
have and we believe will continue to change the characteristics of our markets

Market Stability
• We’ve talked about the stability of the market as evidenced by the high levels of retention, the fact that we are
not the only company returning significant amounts of capital as well as the focus of the industry on returns on
capital
• Advanced analytics and a more demanding regulatory and oversight environment have also meaningfully
contributed
• While there will always be changes in pricing, both increases and decreases, in response to changes in loss
costs, expense loads, interest rates or changes in real or perceived risk, as there are in many industries, we
continue to believe that the amplitude of the cycle has narrowed substantially

Shareholder Value
• Beyond the insurance market dynamics we have real confidence that our organization is well-positioned to
successfully navigate whatever set of challenges the external environment may throw our way
• With our relentless focus on execution, deep and talented management team, highly analytical approach to
underwriting and investment risk, and a very high respect for our shareholders’ capital, we remain
well-positioned to continue to deliver meaningful shareholder value

Jay S. Benet
Financial Highlights
Net Income, Operating ROE and Combined Ratio
• By any measure our fourth quarter results, record net income per diluted share of $3.11, record operating income
per diluted share of $3.07, operating ROE of 17.7% and a combined ratio of 85%, were very strong
• As has been the case all year these strong results were built upon very solid investment and underwriting
performance

Underwriting
• Within underwriting, we continue to earn rate increases in excess of loss cost trends, which was the driver of the
100 basis point improvement in our underlying combined ratio this quarter vs. the prior-year quarter, while
experiencing only a modest level of cat losses and very strong net favorable prior-year reserve development
• Pre-tax cat losses were $41mm in the quarter, down $12mm from last year’s fourth quarter and pre-tax net
favorable PYD was $351mm, up $92mm

Favorable Reserve Development
• While each of our business segments contributed to the favorable reserve development, it was primarily driven by
Bond & Specialty Insurance’s contract surety business for accident years 2012 and prior, and by Business and
International Insurances general liability product line for accident years 2008 through 2012
• As I’ve been doing in recent periods, I’d like to provide you with a preliminary view of what our combined 2014
Schedule P is expected to look like when filed on May 1
• On a combined stat basis for all of our U.S. subs, all accident years developed favorably

Product Lines
• Looking at the data on a product line rather than on an accident year basis, all of our major product lines
developed favorably in the aggregate across all accident years except for relatively small amounts of unfavorable
development in CMP and in personal auto liability
• CMP developed unfavorably by approximately $68mm pre-tax on a reserve base of approximately $3.5B spread
out over several recent accident years, while personal auto liability developed unfavorably by only $20mm
pre-tax on a reserve base of approximately $2B, driven by development on a small number of large PIF claims
from accident years 2005 and prior
• I should also point out that for personal auto in total combining liability and PhysDam reserve development was
essentially a wash as physical damage developed favorably by $18mm pre-tax

Aggregate Cat Reinsurance Products
• We’ve taken advantage of the recent evolution in aggregate cat reinsurance products to restructure our cat
cover, further focusing on severe events than on a single or cumulative basis could impact capital
• Effective January 1, we replaced our previous gen cat treaties, our $400mm cat aggregate excessive loss treaty
which expires as scheduled on December 31, and our $400mm get cat treaty, which our reinsurers agreed to
terminate early as of that date, with the new aggregate XOL treaty that provides coverage for both single
events and accumulation of losses for multiple events
• It’s a simpler structure that provides $1.5B of coverage, part of $2B excess of $3B after $100mm
deductible per occurrence
• It has the same broad apparel and geographic coverage as the former gen cat and XOL treaties and it
positions the coverage layer to provide a significant buffer between earnings and capital

Reinstatement Provisions
• As an aggregate cover there’s a single limit with no reinstatement provisions
• The cost is essentially the same as the previous program, but it provides greater potential recovery after the
higher retention
• Our Northeast gen cat treaty, our cat bonds, earthquake and international covers remain unchanged and I refer
you to page 21 of the webcast for a brief description of the new treaty

Oil Pricing
• Another subject I’d like to touch upon relates to the recent drop in the price of oil

• While this is not the first time that oil is trading at $45 a barrel, it was at today’s levels as recently as 2009
• We thought it would be helpful to provide you with the information appearing on page 22 of the webcast showing
how much of our investment portfolio is invested in below investment grade energy bonds and energy-related
equities
• And as you can see the sum of these investments is relatively small and we believe the exposure to be quite
manageable
• We continue to generate capital well in excess of what is needed to support our businesses, and consistent with
our strategy, we continue to return very significant amounts of capital to our shareholders

Operating Cash Flows, Dividends and Share Repurchases
• Operating cash flows were in excess of $500mm this quarter inclusive of $200mm discretionary contribution we
decided to make to our qualified pension plan bringing, total operating cash flows to almost $3.7B for the year
• We ended the year with holding company liquidity of almost $1.6B after returning almost $1.2B of excess capital
to our shareholders this quarter alone through dividends of $182mm in common share repurchases of a little over
$1B
• And for the full year, we returned almost $4.1B of excess capital to our shareholders through dividends of
$735mm and common share repurchases of over $3.3B
• One final note about share repurchases
• Since we began in 2006, the average price we paid for our shares was $57.56, approximately 60% of our current
stock price
• Once again all of our capital ratios remain at or better than their target levels

Debt-to-Capital Ratio
• Our debt-to-total capital ratio of 21.7% was well within its target range, and during the quarter, book value per
share increased 1% and adjusted book value per share which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses
was also up slightly
• For the full year, book value per share increased 10% and adjusted book value per share increased 7% while net
unrealized investment gains were almost $2B after-tax at the end of the year as compared to $1.3B at the
beginning of the year

Brian W. MacLean
Operating Highlights
Personal Lines
• Alan and Doreen are going to go over the individual segment results, but before they do, I want to make a few
comments about our business and I’ll start with the significant progress we’ve made in Personal lines
• Three years ago, we discussed with you that we would be aggressively pursuing improvements in our financial
returns in both auto and homeowners, primarily due to weather and auto severity trends
• As we close out 2014, we couldn’t be more pleased with the progress that we’ve made

• We’ve taken necessary rate in both our home and auto products while maintaining strong retention levels, and
we’ve tightened underwriting guidelines and made changes to terms and conditions in our Homeowners’ book

Expense Reduction Initiatives
• We also discussed that the increased utilization of comparative raters by independent agents has resulted in a
need to improve our competitive position in the auto market
• To that end, we announced our expense reduction initiatives that would support the rollout of our new more
competitive auto product, Quantum Auto 2.0
• We’ve now achieved our expense reduction goal, and Quantum 2.0 is live in virtually all Quantum states
• The impact from these bold actions on our results has been significant

Homeowners Returns
• Our Homeowners returns are in line with our target range and our top line trends are improving
• In Auto, our returns are operating in a range that is acceptable to us given current market conditions, and
importantly our Auto business is growing again and the higher new business is creating long-term value
• So overall, great progress in the independent agent channel

Direct-to-Consumer Business
• In the direct-to-consumer business, our decision to enter that channel reflected our belief that a large segment
of the Personal Insurance market empowered by increased transparency of product and pricing information
would choose to buy insurance via the direct channel
• While certain customer segments of this market have quickly embraced the direct channel, the customer
demographic that Travelers targets has moved more slowly

Strategic Channel
• With that said, we remain committed to the strategic channel and expect that over time it will become a more
significant portion of our Personal business
• It’s important to note that as we’ve invested in this channel, we have consciously targeted that investment to
help strengthen our independent agent channel, which we believe will continue to be a significant channel for
our customer demographic. and so we feel very good about this investment

Home Product
• The final point I’d make in Personal lines is the growing importance of the home product
• Our industry is built around protecting consumers against risk
• The greater the risk, the greater responsibility and opportunity we have
• In that vein, the extreme weather volatility has added risk to the home exposure, making our
industry-leading capabilities in the homeowners line an even more significant competitive advantage and
critical with the customer segment we target

• Accordingly, we are continuing to invest to make sure that we maintain and leverage our industry-leading
product as a part of a total customer portfolio solution
• So all in, we feel great about the progress we’ve made in this business
• We’re proud of the many employees that have had a hand in executing these initiatives, and we’re grateful to
our agents who have supported us throughout

Commercial Businesses
• In our commercial businesses, we're equally pleased with our progress, specifically seen in the steady
improvement of our product returns, which have been driven by our consistent execution
• As Jay Fishman mentioned in his comments, we’re encouraged by the continued stability of the market, as
evidenced by the strong retention levels we continue to see both in our book and across the market

Closing Remarks
When we analyze our results at a very granular level, we see that we continue to be successful executing our basic
pricing strategy, which is to retain a high percentage of our business that is meeting target returns, improve profitability
where needed, and quote on and write new business that meets our target returns
You’ll see in our results that we’ve had a bit more success last quarter in new business, but I would emphasize that that
is a function of the improved returns on accounts we’re seeing, and not a change in our appetite for new business, and
Alan will comment on this further
So overall great results in 2014, with stable market conditions, very strong underwriting results

Alan D. Schnitzer
Business Highlights
Business and International Insurance
• For Business and International Insurance, our fourth-quarter performance capped off a very good year with
operating income of $630mm in the quarter and more than $2.3B for the full year
• In terms of our production results, in the U.S. retention rates increased throughout the year, the stable renewal
premium change reflecting gradual declines in renewal rate gain and improving exposure
• We’re very pleased with our execution in the field and I’ll comment some more on that in a minute

Underlying Combined Ratio and Pricing
• For the full year, the underlying combined ratio was a strong 92.8%, a 0.5 point improvement from the prior
year
• While earned pricing in excess of loss trend contributed favorably to full year 2014 results, it was also a
negative impact of about 1.5 point from non-catastrophe weather and large losses relative to the prior year
• The underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 93.9%, up 40BPS from the prior year

• The underlying loss ratio improved 40BPS driven by the earned impact of price increases exceeding loss
trends, partially offset by large losses in non-cat weather
• The impact of large losses was about 1.25 point, arising out of our International business
• We see this as a normal level of large loss volatility
• The expense ratio was a little higher y-over-y due to the effects of some favorable expense items in the
prior-year quarter

Production
• Turning to production
• We had a very strong quarter in BII with net written premiums up over 6% from the prior-year quarter driven by
our middle-market business and the inclusion of Dominion for the full quarter

Domestic BI
• In domestic BI, retention increased 83% while renewal premium change increased somewhat from recent
quarters and new business was up about 6%
• These production results reflect what you’ve been hearing from us for the last year or so
• That is given the rate gains we’ve achieved over the past four years, more of our business is achieving
adequate return and for those accounts or classes, our primary objective is retention
• Importantly in our domestic BI business, we are on average still achieving flat-to-slightly-positive written
rate gains on our better performing business segments
• And for the lesser performing segments of our business, we are on average achieving written renewal rate
gains in excess of estimated loss trends

New Business Growth
• Let me comment on the growth on new business in middle-market
• Both Jay and Brian commented on the stability in the marketplace
• As a consequence of that stability, the number of requests for quotes on new business has also been relatively
stable
• However, given the cumulative impact of rate gains in the market broadly over the past four years, a modestly
increasing percentage of the new business requests that we did see in the quarter were at return levels that met
our threshold
• As a result, in the quarter we were able to quote successfully on more accounts
• The new business growth in the quarter does not reflect any changes of our return thresholds or more
aggressive new business pricing

Select, Middle Market and Other Domestic BI Business
• Looking at the production statistics, I’d like to highlight some further detail

• In Select, retention was over 80% for the second consecutive quarter with total renewal premium change of a
little over 8%
• In Middle Market, retention was above 84% for the second consecutive quarter and renewal premium change was
strong and increased slightly from Q3, a great result
• In our Other Domestic BI business, we were pleased that both rate and exposure increased from Q3, resulting in a
100 basis point increase sequentially in renewal premium change
• Also our retention increased to 81%, the highest level in more than two years

International Production Results
• Looking at our production results for International, retention was strong at 82%, slightly higher than recent
quarters
• Renewal premium change was higher than Q3 as exposures improved
• New business was down y-over-y primarily because the new business we saw didn’t meet our return thresholds
• In December, we were pleased to announce that our joint venture with J. Malucelli in Brazil agreed to acquire a
majority interest in Cardinal, a start-up surety provider in Colombia
• The transaction is expected to close in Q2 2015 subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing
conditions

Summary
To sum it up, we’re very pleased with our strong operating income and production results for Q4 and the momentum
we feel going into 2015
In terms of execution going forward, we intend to pursue more of the same

Doreen Spadorcia
Q4 Highlights
Bond and Specialty Insurance
• Bond and Specialty Insurance had a great quarter, rounding out a strong 2014
• Both Q4 and the full-year results are record earnings for the business and we’re very pleased with the financial
returns in this segment

Operating Income and Underlying Combined Ratio
• For Q4, operating income was $216mm, 24% higher than Q4 2013, while full year income of $727mm was
27% higher than 2013
• The increases from prior year were predominantly driven by the higher levels of favorable prior-year reserve
development that Jay Benet referenced earlier
• The underlying combined ratio for both the quarter and full year were strong at 84.1% and 82.2% respectively

Underwriting Performance
• The quarter was slightly higher than 2013 due to a modest re-estimation of prior quarter losses
• The full-year result was 2.5 points better than 2013 due primarily to benefits from exiting our management
liability excess-of-loss treaty
• So while there will always be some ups and downs in the y-over-y variances, we can’t emphasize enough just
how terrific we feel about the results and in particular the underlying fundamentals of how we achieved them
• As with all of our businesses at Travelers, we remain committed to superior underwriting performance of our
portfolios through aggressive management of risk and limit, including:
• Enhanced segmentation
• Underwriting analytics
• And claim management

Production
• Turning to production
• Net written premium for the quarter was $525mm, a decrease of 5% compared to the prior year due to the exit of
our management liability excess-of-loss treaty in Q4 2013, which increased that period’s net written premium
• The nonrenewal of this treaty in 2014, together with higher surety volume, drove a 4% increase in net written
premium for the full year

Management Liability Businesses
• Across our Management Liability businesses, retention of 84% was consistent with recent period in the prior
year, while new business premium of $36mm was generally consistent with recent period
• Renewal premium change, which can be somewhat lumpy due to variations in things like limits written, liability
attachment points and policy duration, was 5% for the quarter
• In sum, I’d like to reiterate one more time just how great we feel about the business and our ability to continue to
produce superior financial results

Personal Insurance
• I’ll turn now to Personal insurance where I’d first like to reiterate Brian’s comments about the progress made in
the business and how great we feel about our ability to have a vibrant consumer business that generates
appropriate returns
• We had a great fourth quarter rounding out a strong 2014

Operating Income and Underlying Combined Ratio
• Operating income for the quarter was $242mm, up slightly from Q4 2013, while underlying income of
$254mm was up 18% for the quarter from the prior year, driven by strong underwriting results
• The underlying combined ratio of 84.3% in the quarter was an improvement of 4.5 points from 2013, while
the full year underlying combined ratio was 86.4%, an improvement of about two points from 2013

• The improvement in underlying results from 2013 for both the quarter and full year reflects continued
benefits from earned pricing exceeding loss trends and our expense reduction initiatives

Expense Reduction Initiatives
• Before addressing the specific results for Auto and Homeowners, I wanted to give some detail on our expense
reduction initiatives
• You’ll recall that our plan was to achieve pre-tax savings of $140mm on a run rate basis by 1/1/2015 and we’re
pleased to tell you that we have achieved that goal
• As we’ve discussed in the past, about half of these reductions relate to claim management expenses, the
impact of which shows up in the loss ratio
• Since we started the program in Q3 2013, there’s about $100mm in cumulative pre-tax savings already in our
earnings through the end of 2014
• For the remaining $40mm, initiatives have already been executed and they will earn through in 2015
• With this specific initiative met and now behind us, please rest assured that we will continue to manage
expenses diligently as we always have

Agency Auto
• Looking at Agency Auto, retention remained strong and consistent at 83%, while renewal premium change was
about 5%
• Quantum Auto 2.0 continues to drive improvements in production, with new business premium of $161mm in the
quarter, 87% higher than Q4 2013 and overall net written premiums increased 4% for the quarter
• We’ve also seen increases in policies in force on a sequential basis for two consecutive quarters now

Profitability
• Turning to Agency Auto profitability
• The underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 97.9%, an improvement of about four points and was
95.9% for the full year, an improvement of just over a point and a half for their comparable 2013 periods
• These improvements were driven by benefits from the expense initiatives and earned pricing exceeding loss
trends, partially offset by the higher impact of new business volumes
• In addition, the quarter included approximately 2.5 points of favorable prior quarter re-estimation
• Lastly on Auto, our current view of overall Auto loss trend remains at about 3% with no meaningful change in
the underlying texture

Agency Homeowners and Other
• Looking at Agency Homeowners and Other, production was strong in the quarter with retention stable at 84%
and renewal premium change of about 6%
• New business premium of $83mm was up almost 40% from the prior-year quarter and we remained focused on
maximizing our market leadership position in the Homeowners line to provide broad consumer solution

points over Q4 2013, driven by earned pricing exceeding loss trend and favorable losses, including non-Cat
weather
• So overall in Personal Insurance, a terrific finish to 2014 and we feel great about our momentum heading into
2015

Closing Remarks
Finally, I’d like to echo one of Brian’s earlier comments and this applies to all of our employees in all the businesses
We are very proud of the hard work of all of our employees and grateful for the partnership with our agents in
achieving these results

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
<Q - Randy Binner>: I wanted to touch on the commentary around rate increases now moving below the increase in
exposures. And I appreciate the commentary that I think you feel like you’re getting rate ahead of loss cost and you’re
more focused on retention there. But a couple of questions. One, I assume there’s going to be a competitive process to
keep retention, so any new initiatives there or any more color on how you plan to keep retention higher. And then as far
as the absolute rate increase number we all watch so closely, I guess that means by definition, we have to see that
continue to moderate if you are achieving the rate adequacy.
<A - Jay S. Fishman>: Hi. This is Jay. Alan and I, I think, will tag-team this a bit. First, just to be clear that about rate
gains, first I assume you’re speaking about our Business Insurance segment. I think what Alan said was in our
best-performing segments of that business – talking really about the Middle Market predominately, but it goes even
beyond that – in our best-performing business, we continue to experience, let’s call it, flat to up a point in terms of rate.
Now relative obviously to an overall loss trend for that segment, it is not keeping pace with it. I will tell you that we’re
not attempting to. That’s not our principal focus. Alan also said that in the poorer performing classes that rate gains
there continued to exceed loss trends. So that’s where we are.
The reason I say we’re not uniquely focused on that is that we are a return-driven organization. And we ask our folks
who have managed this just [ph] excellently (31:37) to remember its agency relationships, its customer relationships.
And it’s how you manage your business over time that matters. We start off with returns over time. That translates to
account management over time. So if an account has had – and I’m speaking very, very broadly here – that if an
account has had three years of increases and they’ve been a good account and we value them, we tell our people that
there’s nothing wrong with renewing that flat. It doesn’t mean that if there’s an opportunity to do a little better because
circumstances suggest it, claim activity rising or otherwise, that they should attempt to do it, but that we manage our
relationships and returns on accounts over time.
So I suspect – and it is just a guess on my part that if we’re right about the cycle dynamics that you’ll see more of a
stair-step in rate gains more than sort of a constant trend line. And ultimately, I suspect with it, the granularity of our
discussion, our best-performing accounts vs. our poorer performing accounts will become more relevant in perhaps the
way you see the world. So now that’s the first part.
The second, you spoke about retentions. We’re not doing anything differently with respect to retain business than we
ever have done. And I’m sure Alan can give you more color and will. But the way generally business is renewed, if the
agent is satisfied, the customer is satisfied, if the market is satisfied, the discussions take place pretty early, well in
advance of the renewal date. The account gets resolved at whatever it is and it gets renewed, whether it’s down a point,
zero, up a point or differently. And so, it’s not as though the retention discussions have become, as you described, more
competitive. I don’t – that simply isn’t how the business is done. Those conversations take place given the data and the
analytics we have in the context of long-term account management and doing the right things for the customer and the

agent for the long term. So I’ll let Alan give you some more color on that, but there isn’t anything in the world of
retention that we’re doing differently.
<A - Alan D. Schnitzer>: Randy, it’s Alan Schnitzer. Let me also address both of those quickly. Industry observers
tend to focus very narrowly on rate change and the long-term estimated loss trend we give you. And I would remind
you of the comments we made last quarter, which is, there’s a component of price change which includes exposure that
from a return perspective and from margins, acts like rate. So we don’t look at the narrow gap between rate and loss
trend maybe quite as precisely as industry’s observer do, and there’s always variations from quarter-to-quarter in
weather and large losses and all those sorts of things that create volatility, +/- within an expected range. So we’re really
in a pretty tight band.
In terms of retention, I would have given you the same comment Jay did about our efforts. It’s – we’re – and I would
highlight a real competitive advantage that we have. This isn’t us needing to do anything else. We’ve got an
extraordinarily field capability. We’ve got great presence in the field, we’ve got great tenure in the field, we’ve got
great relationships, we’ve got great related services like our risk control. And it’s those sorts of things not developed
this month or this quarter but over many, many years that give us the ability to manage retention in a way that we think
is most productive from a profitability perspective.
<A - Jay S. Fishman>: And I would add again that that’s exactly right. It’s not uniquely a price discussion. It’s
important, but it is only one element of long-term relationships and management. And lastly, at least through Q3,
obviously we’re the first one out in the PC business this quarter, retentions at, what I would, consider all the quality
companies, they’re all high. It’s not that we’re describing a set of circumstances that are unique for us. We think we
manage it better than anybody else and maybe there’s – that’s sort of our own pride in it, but the fact is that it’s not our
business that’s been stable, it is broadly speaking the industry that’s been stable. And that’s what’s so important.
<Q - Randy Binner>: Very helpful. Just one quick follow-up, and this is for Jay on the – Jay Fishman -- on the
stair-step comment on rate. I didn’t quite follow how that fitted into the conversation. But I think you’re saying is the
good part of the book becomes more rate-adequate, the places where you’re trying to seek rate increases may have a
kind of a bigger impact on a quarterly basis on what we see for rate change. Is that what you meant by the stair-step vs.
the trend?
<A - Jay S. Fishman>: Yeah, I did; but the second part of that is that at the account level, you may see a year, two
years where an account renews flat and then there’s an attempt to recover, if you will, some of that lost margin relative
to loss trend on that account. We are not – we’re not a company, we haven’t issued an edict to the field that says get
trend on every account. That would be a dumb thing to do. We say to them, manage the long-term return given
everything you know about the agent, the account, the risk profile of that account and manage it thoughtfully. And if
that means that an account’s going to renew flat for a year or two, that’s okay. So that’s really the comment about that
stair-step that I was speaking to.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: I know this is somewhat of a sensitive topic and I hope you’re feeling well, most importantly. If
you could update us on the health condition that was disclosed several months ago along with any update in succession
plans, that would be helpful initially. Thank you.
<A - Jay S. Fishman>: Sure. And I appreciate the question, there’s – I have no sensitivity about it, by the way, none at
all. So first, thank you. I do continue to feel okay. I’m here, I’m on the job, I’m still mobile, it’s a little clunkier than it
was and everybody here is helpful beyond – above and beyond the call of duty in making sure that not only I can
continue to do my job, but everybody here can continue to do theirs. The – as I disclosed, and someone asked me why
did I disclose it? And the answer is, is because I needed to to continue to do the job effectively. It was becoming
apparent for those who were around me a lot that something was amiss, and it was either leave people in confusion and
doubt or provide some clarity with respect to my circumstance.
I’ve chosen not to be specific about the ailment really in respect of my privacy and my family’s privacy and just don’t
think that it really matters a whole lot. Its relevance is I’m 62, there isn’t anything about my circumstance that causes
me to change my view of my ability to continue to work here; if it did, I’d have something else to say. So the horizon is

unchanged in that regard.
We’ve been an active succession planning company for a long time and pretty transparently. If you look and see what
we’ve done and what we’ve announced, it doesn’t take a real genius to sort of see what we’re doing and what the next
generation of leadership here is. I chuckle, you know, we’re – 62 is kind of a magic number here. Brian’s 62. I’m 62.
Jay Benet’s 62. Bill Heyman is 62-plus. And so, it’s just – that responsibility falls on us to make sure that we do this
seamlessly, seamlessly. I would tell you that a) the board knows virtually everything. I have been completely
transparent to them. And to the extent anyone really is interested, I have already begun to cut back fairly meaningfully
on my non-Travelers commitments and I will continue to do that so that I can focus exclusively. Maybe there’s some
philanthropic things I’m not going to give up but to focus relentlessly on what matters here. So that’s the news of the
day.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: I appreciate that. Thank you. Switching gears for Jay Benet. The capital return in 2014 for
Travelers was 112% of operating income, including dividends and buybacks. How should we think about that for the
years going forward?
<A - Jay S. Benet>: There’s really no change in the philosophy. There’s no change in what we’ve said in the 10-Ks
and Qs. Earnings are going to drive what we're able to return subject to the number of items that we list, pension
contributions being one of them. And when you look at a particular quarter you’re going to see the ebbs and flows of
what’s taken place in terms of earnings from prior quarters, making the determination as to how much in particular in
that quarter we’ll be able to return to shareholders. So there’s no change in philosophy, no change in the kind of basis
upon which it’s done. All you're seeing is some excess capital actually that we ended the prior year with working its
way into the share repurchases of 2014.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: I was wondering if you could follow up a little bit on the development. Maybe give us a little
more color, maybe the breakdown between surety and GL. I’m more interested in GL, but on the surety piece, how
much is the non-renewal of that management liability treaty? How much of the impact of that has already come
through? And then on GL, just trying to get some idea on that 2008 to 2012 accident years, where are the most recent
ultimates on those books of businesses compared to where you're booking that business today? Thanks.
<A - Jay S. Benet>: I think some of that is a level of granularity you’ll probably see when we file the Schedule P, and
we’re in the process of summarizing all that data. So to give very detailed information at this point in time I think
would be a bit of a mistake. What we’re trying to do is give the overall picture as to how things have developed. And in
terms of the individual products, the individual accident years, what we’re trying to communicate was, yes, there was
no major shift in anything that affected PYD.
As far as to your specific question on the surety reinsurer, that has no effect on development. That’s a contract that was
in place that was looked at in terms of its cost-benefit and we decided that it wasn’t really something that was achieving
the objectives. And from a profitability standpoint and a risk standpoint, we’d be better off not having it. But that really
had nothing to do with PYD.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Got it. Okay. Thanks. And then just on expenses, the ratio in BI kind of dropped in the back
half of last year and kind of stayed at that level first part of this year. And we’ve risen now to 32.5%-ish range. I mean
where should we expect to see – or I should say 32% and change. Where should we expect to see that? I mean is that
where – and I’m thinking about whether it’s a Dominion or something else, I mean is there an opportunity to kind of
bring that back down to what we are seeing over the sort of trailing 12 months in Q2? Or is that where you expect to
efficiently run? Thanks.
<A - Alan D. Schnitzer>: It’s Alan again. If you look at the full-year expense ratio, I think it was 31.5% and that had a
benefit in it from Q1 that we disclosed then that was on the year worth about half a point. So if you adjust that first
quarter event and have that half point back in, round numbers that's sort of what we feel like would be a fair run rate.
<A - Doreen Spadorcia>: Sorry. And the benefit, just to remind you all, is the workers' compensation state assessment
liability that we talked about.

<A - Alan D. Schnitzer>: We had a reduction in estimated liability that we announced in Q1 and we quantified it, so
you’ll see it in our press release and 10-Q for Q1. So that really was the anomaly this year. So if you add that back in
and look at the full year, round numbers I’d say it’s always going to be up or down a little bit for one thing or another
but that will give you sort of a ballpark.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Got it. Okay. And then just last one for Jay Fishman, is there anything that you think could
happen in the reinsurance market as far as evolution or innovations that would allow you or cause you to consider
pursuing more growth in catastrophe-exposed areas utilizing reinsurance? Or is that something at this point it’s still not
something that you foresee? Thanks again.
<A - Jay S. Fishman>: Sure. And it’s a relevant question of course. So first, we’re engaged, involved and looking at
lots of different things. The specific question you ask is are you prepared to build primary exposure and rely on a
reinsurance profile that may or may not be permanent to produce an effective loss profile. And there’s the potential of
mismatches there are substantial, meaning on the primary side very difficult to nonrenew, reinsurance obviously can be
nonrenewed instantly. And when that happens, even if you do pursue a primary nonrenewal strategy, you’ve at 12
months where you’re out of sync where the primary exposure sits and the reinsurance is simply not there anymore. So
that’s an arbitrage that I think has a potential mismatch to it that’s concerning.
Now if reinsurance pricing were to drift low enough, and in my judgment it is not there yet, you might sit there and
contemplate doing that. But I would say that the risk, the mismatch risk there has real shareholder value attachment to it
as well as regulatory. I mean imagine trying to nonrenew a significant enough book of business where you would
actually do this as a strategy as opposed to an operating tactic.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Right.
<A - Jay S. Fishman>: It would be very disruptive. So I think not in that regard but it doesn’t mean that there might
not be other opportunities and we’re sure pushing it around. It’s not obvious to us yet. It’s pluses and minuses. These
things all have certain complexities to them, but it is not obvious to us yet that there is some magic dynamic there that’s
happened that changes the fundamental underlying economics of being in the primary business. Now maybe it’ll keep
going in that direction but at least not yet.
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: I think it’s a really interesting topic for us to talk about today. Going back 10 years, people
weren’t sure about the deal but it’s obviously been a fantastic success, and as we’re seeing a new wave of
consolidation, I’m curious to hear your perspective on the M&A we’re seeing in the market today? When you think
about the opportunities you guys are presenting, I’m sure you’ve had a lot of opportunities to consider and debate this.
And I’m wondering more specifically, you’ve made a couple of smaller investments in the past couple of years. Should
we expect you to do more of these as stock buybacks become more expensive than your multiple runs? Or alternatively
should we expect you guys potentially to be more of a material consolidator in the small mid-cap consolidation wave
that seems to be starting? I’d just love to get a sense of how you think about capital priorities here.
<A - Jay S. Fishman>: It’s a really good question. So let’s break it into a couple of component parts. First on the
international horizon, to the extent, and the Columbia situation was a pretty good one I think. Dominion, even though it
was $1B trade, but to the extent there are opportunities to do things of that nature where a business is either relatively
new or underperforming and we think that collectively locally and what we bring ourselves we can improve it, we’ll
continue to look for those opportunities. They’re increasingly harder to find, driven in some measure by the economics,
much of the economic environment outside the U.S. as well as the general competitive environment that exists outside
the U.S.
There are lots of areas where you’d say, God, the last thing you want to do is be competing there. And that list is not an
insignificant list, but nonetheless to the extent that opportunities present themselves on the international front, we will
most certainly look at them. I wouldn’t contemplate – by the way, I could be completely wrong here, meaning you
asked me for an outlook. I’m giving it to you today. That doesn’t mean [ph] that we (49:34) couldn't change, but I
wouldn’t contemplate that those would be large transactions. I don’t know how one would look at Dominion. I don’t
think of it as a large transaction; meaningful but I wouldn’t contemplate that the international front would be that.

We really have no interest in the reinsurance business in the broader sense. So to the extent that there are things
happening in that arena, Bermuda or otherwise, we largely don’t pay attention to it, and I don’t really have a view on
the value that’s created there. I’m not knowledgeable. I’m not close enough to it to have a thoughtful view.
We’ve always said about acquisitions, and this hasn’t changed, it’s very, very much the same. We are a return-driven
organization. The principal view that we would take through looking at anything is what would it do to our return
profile over time? Would it potentially improve our return dynamics and that could be either in magnitude or in
volatility? So to the extent there is diversification, geographic expansion, and providing lower volatility against those
returns, that could meet the threshold also.
The challenge for us in that regard is that when you do something small in our business, you take all the risks of
whatever it was, whatever undisclosed liability, whatever policy was written 20 years, 30 years, 40 years ago, you’ve
got it. And in many cases the controls and procedures and knowledge base that exists in small companies just is not
sufficient to warrant the risks that you take to getting into it. They just don’t have the database that gives you a sense of
comfort when you’re spending your shareholders' money that it’s wise.
And in the larger transactions, given that we are such a high return organization relative to the industry, it’s hard to find
at a price that can be achieved a transaction that would meet that return threshold. They would all make us bigger for
sure, but that's interesting but not entirely relevant. We’re big enough. We don’t need to be any bigger, but we are
driven about returns, driven by them.
So if something significant were ever to be available, we’d look and we’d look hard. I do think that we are really good
– by the way, at the front-end and the back-end, meaning the analysis that goes on when we look at something and then
once we decide to proceed, the execution strength in a very complex and complicated transaction, I think we’re pretty
good at that, and I’m speaking out for what people know in the marketplace, but also what you don’t know.
The things that we’ve looked at, the things that we’ve walked away from because our own due diligence suggested, no,
that’s not for us. And so it’s good, but I think the challenge will be meeting all those standards. That doesn’t mean we
won’t roll up our sleeves and dig in and we’ll continue to try. Again, that’s my – as fulsome answer as I can give you.
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: That’s helpful, Jay. Thank you. If I could sneak in a quick one on pricing. So, look, I get that it
used to be a very cyclical industry and become much more data driven and the companies are more disciplined. But if
you’re in the trenches and you’re an actuary and underwriter, should we be expecting that generally good companies,
people who file the data are going to be able to cover their costs over the next couple of years, raising pricing 2%, 3%
whatever that entails? Or is that just kind of unrealistic, that it's still – competition and capacity still matters and
basically the market price is going to be driven by the more aggressive guys who probably don’t do as good a job
managing their business and they cut the market price to reduce margins themselves and shift to top line growth?
<A - Jay S. Fishman>: I’m always hesitant to speak for any other company, because I can only from the outside in
perceive how they are managing their business, but I can speak to what we do and how we run our business.
Underwriters will do – good ones will do with precision what you ask them to do. And so you’d better be really good at
knowing what you’re asking of them. And we have taken the view, and my read from the outside looking in is that
we’re not unique in this regard, others too, if you tell an underwriter grow, they will. We don’t tell them that. We tell
them to find thoughtful ways to deploy capital, and if they can’t, it’s okay. It’s okay.
No one will ever be asked here why they didn’t meet their volume budget, because the first time you ask them that
they’ll meet it the next quarter, and all of us understand that you would never speak to a loan officer that way at the
bank. You wouldn’t say to a loan officer, here’s your volume goal, damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead. We don’t
perceive that there’s a lot of difference between that risk profile and speaking to field underwriters. So we value their
judgment and their insight and the data and analytics that we have in front of them to make thoughtful decisions, to
own the account, to think about do I want that account in my portfolio for the long term and what will they do to the
return of my portfolio in a collaborative environment of the type that we have here.

I can’t underestimate. I can’t overstate, rather. I’m sorry. I can’t overstate how different that is than it was 20 years ago.
It’s just quite different and I think most importantly, is that the feedback loop between what goes on in the field and
what’s really – and the knowledge at the home office to what is going on is stunningly shorter than it was 20 years ago.
And so the ability to act and react to changes, not just cyclical big-time changes but local changes, an office, a market,
a company in a local place is just that much better. So I believe, again I could be dead wrong. I think that the cyclicality
of our business is and will be meaningfully reduced.
Anybody who has tried, prices are up now, let’s grow, I can’t think of one company that has successfully executed that
strategy in any meaningful way and if you look at history, it becomes difficult to say, boy, that’s a smart thing to do. I
think the people who manage our businesses understand what it means to manage a risk profile and as a consequence
they will do so. Now, on a given year where we seek a – if long long-term, if loss trend is 4%, we would be stupid to
tell underwriters they’ve got to get 4% on every account. That means we’ll lose the accounts that don’t need 4% in their
returns and we will get 4% on those accounts that need 10%.
And so we say to them be return-driven with that account. Be smart, be thoughtful and be return-driven and it has
worked for us and I think if there’s anything about our results over these particularly last five years, I think that many
industry observers have not appreciated how productive that approach can be to profitability improvement. Getting the
right rate on the right account is really what it’s all about and I think more and more people are beginning to understand
that.
<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: Two quick questions. Well, one quick, maybe the other one a little bit less quick. Since we’ve
had a notable drop in interest rates, if you could 7 of what the new money yields look like for your portfolio vs. the
portfolio yield today?
<A - William H. Heyman>: Well, Jay Benet has given you an idea of what our expectations would be over the next
two years or three years due to the drop in interest rates. We did that in the back of an envelope last night. That’s
already obsolete, but last night the new money rates were about 50BPS lower than the rates Jay was using to make his
calculation, which would equate to about $20mm a year after taxes of lower earnings. Now, no, $20mm a year.
<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: Oh, I’m sorry. The delta.
<A - William H. Heyman>: The delta. This morning the 10-year rate is up a little bit, so that $20mm is probably
$15mm or $16mm, but there’s no question that these rates are lower. Last year as we look at our investor results which
exceeded 2013 much to our surprise, they did so notwithstanding the fact that the rates were lower than our projections
at the beginning of the year. We made for this year a new set of projections which already looks [ph] full, (58:59) we're
22 days in but we’re not prepared to throw the towel in yet. but nonetheless about $20mm a year difference.
<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: Got it.
<A - Jay S. Fishman>: And by the way that was Bill Heyman speaking.
<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: Right. And the ten-year is actually down a little bit today so – but by the end of the call it might
be up. Who knows?
Second question, if we could get more color on international price change. We saw the premium change but obviously
that includes exposure but what’s happening from a pricing standpoint in your major international markets?
<A - Alan D. Schnitzer>: I don’t have that slide in front of me right now, but I think it’s in the webcast. But, it was the
– you’re talking about rate internationally?
<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: Yes.
<A - Alan D. Schnitzer>: I would say what you see there in RPC is split probably pretty evenly between rate and
exposure.
<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: Okay. So you’re still getting overall increases internationally?

<A - Alan D. Schnitzer>: We still have an overall positive renewal rate change in International, yes. And the other
thing I would tell you about our international relative to U.S. is our outlook for loss trend outside the U.S. is lower than
U.S., because we don’t have the same level of exposure to medical inflation.

<A - Jay S. Fishman>: No, non-cats...
<A - Alan D. Schnitzer>: Non-cat weather and large losses?
<A - Gabriella Nawi>: …and large losses.
<A - Jay S. Benet>: …and large losses.
<A - Alan D. Schnitzer>: Yeah, so…
<Q - Larry Greenberg>: The stuff that would flow into underlying.
<A - Alan D. Schnitzer>: Yeah. Certainly above expectation, and above the prior year.
<A - Jay S. Benet>: Yeah. I think when you look at the entire company, because this is going to be – yeah, things like
what you’re asking: large losses, non-cat weather, they're going to be episodic, they’re going to be dependent upon
geography and things of that sort. So when you look at the entire company, I don’t think that this year, 2014, was all
that unusual a year as it relates to weather. I think when you look – I’m talking non-cat weather now. When you look at
PI and BI combined, it was probably pretty normal, although BI was a little higher and PI was probably a little lower in
terms of what they might consider to be normal.
I think when you make the contrast to last year, which gets you away from an expectation and gets you into the weather
and large loss activity of last year, meaning 2013 vs. 2014, there I think 2014 was a little worse than 2013, but still a
good year. Hopefully that’s helpful.
<Q - Larry Greenberg>: Yeah, no, that...
<A - Jay S. Benet>: And what we tried to do in the press release was provide you not with the data, because it’s
difficult to measure these things, but to adopt a phrase of normal variability and loss activity from quarter-to-quarter to
try to accommodate this sort of thought process, and get away from the: is it good, is it bad? It is going to vary, and
hopefully when you get to a full year, some of the variance is less pronounced.
<A - Alan D. Schnitzer>: It’s a challenge for us to estimate normal non-cat weather. It’s easier for us to speak about
non-cat weather this year compared to last, this quarter compared to last year’s quarter. But it’s been exceptionally
difficult for us to come to what would be a normal non-cat weather number, so we have a hard time speaking to it that
way.
<A - Jay S. Benet>: And part of – if I could just add, like, an example of what makes it difficult, you’ll have times
when given the granularity of what we look at, you’ll be looking at information that says, well, large loss activity is up
somewhere. And then you get into it and say, well, why is it up? Well, because slips and falls have taken place. But
why did slips and falls take…? It was because of the weather. So it's just a very difficult bucketing process to end up
summarizing all of this data, and what we try to do is give you the concepts of what’s taking place.

<Q - Larry Greenberg>: Great. No, that’s helpful. And then on direct, I listened to what you had said earlier about
continuing to invest in that business. So the last couple of years, you’ve generated statutory underwriting losses of
about $100mm. I mean the business is growing top line a bit, you’re getting a little bit of scale economics probably. But
I mean, when we think about that over the next few years, I mean, is that sort of the normal run rate of what
expectations should be? Or I mean, is there going to be a drop in investment spending somewhere out there?
<A - Jay S. Fishman>: Well, this is Jay Fishman. I don’t have a better number if I’m looking out than the one we’re
experiencing now, and to the extent markets change, [ph] circumstance (1:04:54) change, obviously our strategy will,
but we start off with the premise that – and when we started this investment we said it: we said we were less concerned
than some industry observers that the typical Travelers customer would go to buying direct, but we weren’t ready to bet
the ranch on that and therefore ignore the trend. So the development has been important. It is not apparent to us yet that
there are enough Travelers-type customers who choose to buy direct where direct business is scalable on its own.
It’s not that we don’t know how to get people to respond or how to quote and how to issue; we’ve become really, really
good at that. It’s that the number of people that we would think of as the customer that we seek are not choosing to
respond that way. Now, that may change three or four or five years from now. It’s a trend. I don’t think it’s appropriate
to ignore it. So we will continue to develop the expertise and the skill so that if in fact things change and there is a
market opportunity for us, we’re in a position to respond and we're not late.
The other point I’d make, and I don’t know how to quantify it for you, but I would tell you that the benefit to the
agency business from the investment, the technology, and the underlying customer reach attributes, the ways customer
connects to us, our ability to respond as an – call it an electronic company for lack of a better term, that’s just been
invaluable. Now I don’t know how many dollars it’s meant in the agency business but I do know it’s important. And as
I would remind everyone, I’m not so unhappy that the Travelers customer has not turned away from the agency channel
as quickly as some people thought. That’s good for us. We’ve got a very big agency-based business that’s very
profitable and if that change continues to occur more slowly, that’s just fine with us.
So this is kind of a hedge-year position investment that's necessary, because it’s just not clear that it will continue this
way. But I would say, yeah, that’s what I would certainly include if I were thinking about it.
<Q - Brian Robert Meredith>: Just two quick ones here. First one for Alan and Jay, if I look at the business,
insurance business right now and if we look at the returns they’re generating, they’re pretty attractive right now. Is
there any consideration or thought about having underwriters expand their risk profile right now, looking maybe into
the E&S market a little bit? I know that kind of ebbs and flows with the cycles and also loss trend continues to be pretty
favorable, so I think that’s an area possibly for growth?
<A - Alan D. Schnitzer>: Yeah, Brian it's Alan. I guess the way we would think about that is, we’re always
challenging ourselves to think about whether there are new marketplace opportunities but I would distinguish that from
changing our risk profile to do it. So if we could find opportunities, whether it’s in Energy or whether it’s in E&S or
any other market, we would certainly look at it but that would not involve any change in our return thresholds or our
risk appetite.
<Q - Brian Robert Meredith>: Got you. Okay. And then the second one is for Doreen. Just looking at the
Homeowners continue to see kind of declines in PIF. Any thoughts on when that could start to stabilize or maybe start
to trend upwards? And what impact do you think the decline in PIF in the Homeowners business is having on your
Auto insurance growth here?
<A - Doreen Spadorcia>: Brian, good morning. I’ll answer that with a couple of different comments. We’ve put some,
as Brian referenced in his comments, due to some of the weather that we were seeing coming through the book and just
where the levels of deductibles were and roof issues, we took some pretty strong actions in the Homeowners book. And
some of our declines there were deliberate, whether there might be some concentration in some areas, so it wasn’t
unexpected to us that we would see some shrinkage.
That being said, we feel really great that we’ve come through the other side of that, where our deductibles are, where
the PIF is. The rest of the market probably wasn’t as aggressive as we were in addressing property. But from where we

are today and launching forward, we’re very excited about that. We feel like we’ve got just a great launch point on that.
You know there’s no question that – because we look at account underwriting, there’s no question that when there’s
pressure on one product, there might be some impact to the other product around either new business or retention. So
we have seen with QA2 as we’ve become more competitive there that we think that’s allowed us to start growing the
home line again. We’re still in a negative position but I can tell you that for 2015 and beyond, that’s going to be a very
strong focus of ours, whether it’s going to be how we view digital marketing, leading with some of our home
capabilities because we think they’re industry-leading, whether it’s to look at some different kind of practices in the
quote process or an overall customer view, so we can utilize the strength in the property line to actually get more, not
just more Homeowners business but more customer business for the Travelers.
So, we knew that Homeowners was going to be – the recovery was going to follow Auto, so we’re in the spot that we
thought we would be and there’s a lot of focus on that
