Bloomberg Transcript

Operator
Good morning, and welcome to the Fairfax 2016 Year-End Results Conference Call. Your
lines have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct a
question-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any
objections, you may disconnect at this time.
Your host for today's call is Prem Watsa, with opening remarks from Eric Salsberg. Mr.
Salsberg, please begin.

Eric P. Salsberg

{BIO 1552007 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss Fairfax's year-end 2016
results. This call may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ perhaps
materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements as a result of a variety
of uncertainties and risk factors, the most foreseeable of which are set out under Risk
Factors in our Base Shelf Prospectus, which has been filed with Canadian Securities
regulators and is available on SEDAR.
I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Prem Watsa.

Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Thank you, Rick. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Fairfax's conference
call on our 2016 results. I plan to give you some of the highlights and then, pass it on to

Dave Bonham, our CFO, for additional financial details.

FINAL

In 2016, book value per share decreased 6.4% adjusted for the $10 per share common
dividend paid in the first quarter of 2016. Our insurance companies had an excellent year
with a combined ratio of 92.5% with excellent reserving and significant underwriting profits
of $576 million.
For the full year, all our operating segments had combined ratios below 100% with an
overall combined ratio of 92.5%. Zenith had a very good combined ratio of 79.7%, Fairfax
Asia 86.4% and OdysseyRe 88.7%, all below a 90% combined ratio.
The insurance and reinsurance operations produced strong operating income, excluding
net gains or losses on investments of $1 billion. In 2016, we realized gains on our
investment portfolio of $564 million before the equity hedges.

Bloomberg Transcript

Excluding all hedging losses and before mark-to-market fluctuations in our investment
portfolio, we earned approximately $1.2 billion in pre-tax income for the year. Including all
hedging losses and mark-to-market fluctuations in our investment portfolio, we've
reported an after-tax loss of $513 million for 2016. It was a painful quarter and year for
Fairfax. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses premium volume was up for the fullyear of 2016 by 3.8%.
At the subsidiary level, the change in net premiums written for the year and the combined
ratios were as follows. OdysseyRe, premiums were flat, combined ratio of 88.7% as I said
before; Crum & Forster up 9%, combined ratio of 98.2%,; and Northbridge in Canadian
dollars up 10% with a combined ratio of 94.9%; Zenith up 4% with a combined ratio of
79.7%; Fairfax Asia up 10% with a combined ratio of 86.4%; and Brit with a combined ratio
of 97.9%, Brit was in 2015 for about five months, and now was in 2016 was there for the
full year.
As we've said before, very low interest rates and reduced reserved redundancies means
that there is no place to hide for our industry. Combined ratios have to remain well below
100% for the industry to make a single-digit return on equity with these lower interest
rates. While the short-term is always tough to predict, fundamentals will eventually play
out and we believe pressure will continue to be on the industry to make an underwriting
profit.
Net investment losses of $1.2 billion for the year consisted of the following. Please refer to
page 2 of our press release. Net losses on equity and equity related investments was $1.3
billion, resulting from net losses of $105 million on our equity investments, and a $1.2 billion
net loss on our equity hedge mainly because of a 19.5% increase in the rest of 200 index
during the year. We've realized losses of $184 million in our equity portfolio on our equities
primarily related to SandRidge Energy and realized $2.6 billion of losses due to the
removal of our hedges. More on the removal of our hedges later.
Our CPI-linked derivatives with a notional value of approximately $110 billion produced
unrealized losses of $196 million during the year. The majority of these contracts as you

know are based on the underlying U.S. CPI index about 54% or the European Union CPI
index of about 40%. Further information is available on page 4 of our press release,
where we have included a table of the inflation swaps.
On average, they have 5.6 years to run. We continue to hold them as insurance for the
unexpected, events like a collapse in World Trade, a problem with China or the
disintegration of the European Union. So we will continue to hold our deflation swaps.
When you review our statements, please remember that when we own more than 20% of
our company via equity account and when we own above 30%, we consolidate. So that
mark-to-market gains in these companies are not reflected in our results.
The fair values of our investment in an associates is $3.3 billion, versus the carrying value
of $2.6 billion and unrealized gain of $700 million, that's not on our balance sheet.
Investment gains have been an important component of our returns over time, since we
began 31 years ago, we've had a cumulative $10.2 billion in realized and unrealized gains.

Bloomberg Transcript

As we mentioned in our annual meetings, annual reports and quarterly calls with IFRS
accounting with stocks and bonds are recorded at market and subject mark-to-market
gains and losses, quarterly and the annual income will fluctuate widely and investment
results will only make sense over the long term.
In December 2016, Fairfax entered into an agreement to acquire Allied World, a marketleading global property casualty and specialty insurer and reinsurer. Under the terms of
this agreement, Allied World shareholders would receive a combination of Fairfax
subordinate voting shares and cash equal to $54 per Allied World share for a total equity
value of approximately $4.9 billion.
In January 2017, the company entered into an agreement, pursuant to which OMERS will
invest $1 billion in order to indirectly acquire approximately 21% of the issued and
outstanding shares of Allied World, simultaneously with the acquisition of Allied World.
We are in the final rounds of negotiations with a number of parties that are interested in
following almost leaders, co-investors, and we are confident that we will be able to raise
an additional $500 million and potentially up to $1.5 billion. We continue to work with
partners to utilize the remainder of the option. The transaction remains subject to a
number of regulatory approvals and certain Allied World shareholder approvals. Closing of
the transaction is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2017.
Over 31 years, our decentralized approach and our fair and friendly culture have attracted
many companies that join us and property and casualty insurance and elsewhere. We are
the first choice for many good companies and management teams, both from an
acquisition point of view as well as the financing.
Let me explain how it works from a management standpoint. AMAG in Indonesia, which
we acquired in 2016, is run by Linda Delhaye, who has run it for more than 10 years, and is
part of Fairfax Asia, run by Mr. Athappan. Bryte Insurance, formerly Zurich South Africa, is

Page 3 of 22



Company N ame: Fairfax Financial H oldings L td

run by Edwyn O'Neill and came to us through Mark Cloutier at Bryte Insurance, who will
continue to monitor it while reporting to Andy Barnard.

FINAL

The Latin American companies and portfolios in Eastern Europe, we acquired from AIG,
have individual branch managers in all of the countries reporting to Peter Csakvari for
Eastern Europe and Company Presidents reporting to Fabricio Campos for Latin America;
both of whom report to Bijan Khosrowshahi.
Peter Csakvari has been with us for two years following 17 years with AIG; and Fabricio just
joined us and was with AIG for more than 15 years. Bijan has been with us for eight years
and before that, he was with AIG for 23 years. Bijan, of course, will work closely with Andy
Barnard.
Allied World built by Scott Carmilani and his team, have an outstanding track record, and
will continue to be run by Scott working with Andy. We discussed this in our December 19,
2016's conference call, and you said this would be a transformative acquisition for Fairfax.
For all of you shareholders who haven't had a transcript, or a look at the presentation, I'd
recommend going and reviewing that.

Bloomberg Transcript

Over the past six months, Nigel Fitzgerald has led the charge to buy Tower in New
Zealand, a company that has operated there for over 145 years. While we were all
impressed by Richard Harding and the team who run the company, Nigel who runs Advent
in London, will work with Richard as well as continue to be responsible for Advent, all
reporting into Andy. The transaction remains subject to shareholder and regulatory
approvals.
Recently, we've created a company called Fairfax Africa and it is listed on the Toronto
Stock Exchange today, having raised $500 million. The reason behind this is similar to
Fairfax India. Four years ago, we met Mike Wilkerson and Neil Holzapfel and we took
AFGRI private together on the Johannesburg Exchange. AFGRI has been a great
investment. And with Neil and Mike having specialized in Africa for the past decade, and
with Neil and two partners permanently located in South Africa, we decided to create
Fairfax Africa to take advantage of the significant opportunities there.
These are all examples of how our decentralized approach and fair and friendly culture
work together to provide outstanding opportunities for you, our shareholders.
At year-end, Fairfax India had invested $1.1 billion that it had raised about two years ago.
So early in 2017, Fairfax India completed a $500 million share offering at a price of $11.75
per share. Subsequently, Fairfax India purchased additional shares in IIFL for a total
consideration of $75 million and now holds approximately 27% of the company.
Also, in 2017, Fairfax India acquired 51% of Saurashtra, the largest container freight station
at Mundra Port for $30 million. We continue to be very excited about the potential in India,
especially under Prime Minister Modi's leadership.

FINAL

Please note that Fairfax India and Fairfax Africa are great investments for us. But, over
time, will also be a significant source of earnings, through an additional income stream of
fees that come to Fairfax Financial.
As we said in our third quarter call, with the uncertainties of the U.S. elections and a
possible new U.S. administration, we decided to sell 90% of our U.S. long treasuries. In the
fourth quarter, we continued to reduce the duration of our bond portfolio to
approximately one year through the sale of additional treasury bonds and U.S. muni bonds
and repurchased treasury locks for the bonds that have yet to be sold.
The effective sale of our bond portfolios had a cumulative realized gain of $2.3 billion
from our original cost – $1 billion from treasuries and $1.3 billion from U.S. muni bonds. The
risk in our bond portfolio through an increase in interest rates has been eliminated. Also,
after the election, we eliminated our Russell and other index hedges and reduced our
individual company shorts. The volatility of the past in our earnings from our holdings of
long bonds and equity hedges is over.

Bloomberg Transcript

Why did we make these dramatic changes? We believe the new U.S. administration's
proposed policies of reducing corporate taxes to 15% to 20%, rolling back regulation and
business like Obamacare, Dodd-Frank and a myriad other regulations and significant
infrastructure spending has the potential of boosting economic growth significantly in the
United States.
Already sentiment among small business has improved dramatically and animal spirits in
the U.S. have been revived. When the U.S. economy, which is approximately $20 trillion
does well, much of the world does well, too. To us this means, our concerns of China or
Europe precipitating a worldwide recession depression, have been significantly reduced
but not eliminated.
Also, the trade policies of the U.S., could precipitate a collapse in world trade. So these
risks will be very much monitored by us, but we think the new administration's policies
may make this a stock pickers' market and one in which we have thrived over the past 31
years.
In the past few years, we have played defense. We are expecting to play offense, but
always with a long-term value-oriented investment philosophy. We will continue to pick
good companies, which provides significant downside protection and potential
appreciation over the long-term. Our recent investments of $150 million in Chorus, and
CAD 150 million in Mosaic in a bond and warrant structure are examples of an
emphasizing downside protection with potential upside with great management teams
with excellent track records. The stock markets are not cheap, but selectively we expect
to invest our $10 billion in cash over time, always keeping a watchful eye on the risks
outlined earlier.
Over the last few months, there have been media and analyst reports with respect to a
rumored $1 billion sale of our portion of our 35% stake in ICICI Lombard and to a rumored
application by us with an Indian partner for a new insurance license in India. These reports
Page 5 of 22



Company N ame: Fairfax Financial H oldings L td
Company Ticker: FFH CN Equity
Date: 2017-02-17

have noted that if a new license were issued, we would be required to own no more than
10% of ICICI Lombard. We cannot comment specifically on these rumors.

FINAL

However, what we could say as that we have in the past is reminded our shareholders
that we have created significant value in our investments in numerous companies that are
not valued at market value in our financial statements. And for the right price, these
holdings may be sold opportunistically.
Now, I would like to turn it over to Dave Bonham, our CFO, so he can give you some more
information on the underlying financials. Dave?

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Prem. First of all, we wanted to let you know that in addition to the press
release that we issued yesterday, all of the details of our fourth quarter and year-to-date
financial results will be made available in our Annual Report, which we posted for our
website on March 10, 2017. So now, we can move into Fairfax's consolidated results for the
full year of 2016, some details of the operating company results and then onto our
consolidated financial position. So for the full year of 2016, Fairfax reported a net loss of
$513 million or $24 for fully diluted share and that would compare to net earnings of $568
million, $23 for fully diluted share in the full year of 2015. The net loss in 2016 principally
reflected net investment losses that were offset by strong operating income.
Our insurance and reinsurance operations produced an underwriting profit of $576 million
and a combined ratio of 92.5% in 2016 that compared writing profit of $705 million and a
combined ratio of 89.9% last year. The decrease in underwriting profit year-over-year was
about a $129 million principally reflected increased current period catastrophe losses,
partially offset by higher net favorable prior year reserve development.
Net premiums written by our insurance and reinsurance operations increased by 11% in
2016 principally reflecting the consolidation of Brit's net premiums written of about $1.5
million in the full year of 2016 compared to about $946 million for the period that we
owned Brit in 2015.
So turning to our operating company results, we can start with OdysseyRe. In 2016,
OdysseyRe reported an underwriting profit of $235 million and a combined ratio of 89%
that compared to underwriting profit of $337 million and a combined ratio of 85% in 2015.
Slightly lower underwriting profit in 2016 principally reflected higher current period
catastrophe losses, the impact of lower net premiums earned, lower writings of higher
margin property catastrophe business and continued rate pressure, and that's partially
offset by increased net favorable prior year reserve development and lower current
period extraordinary losses. OdysseyRe wrote about $2.1 billion in net premiums in 2016
and that was fairly consistent with the net premiums they wrote in 2015.
Moving onto Crum & Forster, Crum & Forster's underwriting profit of $32 million and a
98% combined ratio in 2016 was slightly lower than the underwriting profit of $35 million
at a 98% combined ratio in 2015. The decrease in underwriting profit was principally due
Page 6 of 22



Company N ame: Fairfax Financial H oldings L td
Company Ticker: FFH CN Equity
Date: 2017-02-17

FINAL

to increased current period catastrophe losses at a deterioration in accident and health
loss experience in the current action here, and that's principally related to a single
program and increased commission expense. And those factors were partially offset by
net favorable prior year reserve development, and an improvement in non-cat loss
experience in the current accident year. There is no net favorable prior year reserve
development last year.
Crum & Forster's net premiums written increased by 9% in 2016, primarily reflecting
growth in the accident and health and commercial transportation lines of business, as well
as incremental contributions from the acquisitions Crum completed in 2015, that was
partially offset by decreases in their construction contracting line of business.

Bloomberg Transcript

Zenith National reported increased underwriting profit in 2016 of $164 million and a
combined ratio of 80% that compared to an underwriting profit of $134 million and a
combined ratio of 83% in 2015. The improvement in 2016 principally reflected increased
net favorable prior reserve development and a lower estimated accident year loss ratio.
Net premiums written by Zenith of $890 million in 2016 increased by 4% year-over-year
principally reflecting an increase in exposure and that's partially offset by modest price
decreases. Northbridge reported underwriting profit of $46 million and a combined ratio
of 95% in 2016 compared to an underwriting profit of $71 million and a combined ratio of
92% in 2015. Northbridge's underwriting results in 2016 reflected the impact of increased
current period catastrophe losses, namely the Fort McMurray wildfires and a deterioration
in non-cat loss experience related to the current year, that's principally the result of
increased frequency of large losses and that was all partially offset by increased net to
favorable prior reserve development. In Canadian dollar terms, net premiums written by
Northbridge in 2016 increased by 10%, reflecting increased new business writings at
Northbridge Insurance and modest price increases across the group.
Turning to Brit. In 2016, Brit produced an underwriting profit of $29 million and the
combined ratio of 98%. In 2015, Brit produced an underwriting profit of $45 million and a
combined ratio of 95%. And as a reminder, Brit was acquired in June 2015, so
comparative figures for 2015 are only for the period in which we owned it. The
underwriting profit in 2016 included $76 million of current period catastrophe losses and
that was principally comprised the impacts of Hurricane Matthew and the Fort McMurray
wildfires.
Fairfax Asia reported increased underwriting profit of $41 million and the combined ratio
of 86% in 2016, at compared underwriting profit of $35 million and a combined ratio of
88% in 2015.
Net premiums written by Fairfax Asia increased by 10% in 2016, that principally reflected
the acquisitions of the Fairfirst Insurance in Sri Lanka and AMAG in Indonesia. Also
reflected increased ratings at Pacific Insurance and the impact of increased premium
retention and that was primarily at First Capital.

FINAL

The insurance and reinsurance other segment produced an underwriting profits of $28
million and combined ratio of 94% in 2016, somewhat lower than the underwriting profit
of $46 million and combined ratio of 90% in 2015. The decrease in underwriting profit in
2016 principally reflected increased current period catastrophe losses and lower net
payroll prior year reserve development partially offset by improvements in the non-cat
loss experience related to the current action year.
Net premiums written by the insurance and reinsurance, other segment decreased by 6%
in 2016 and that decrease reflected the non-recurring impact of the QBE loss portfolio
transfer in 2015 at Polish Re and decreased as a Group Re primarily related to the nonrenewal in 2016 of an intercompany property quote share agreement with Brit. Those
were partially offset by increases at Fairfax Brazil and Advent.
Runoff reported an operating loss of $149 million in 2016 compared to an operating loss
of $74 million in 2015, the increase in the operating losses in 2016 principally reflected
higher net adverse development and lower interest and dividend income, partially offset
by lower operating expenses.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to some of our consolidated figures. Consolidated interest and dividend income
increased from $512 million in 2015 to $555 million in 2016 reflected higher interest
income earned that was principally on increased holdings of higher yield in government
and corporate bonds, partially offset by the impact of sales of U.S. state municipal bonds.
We had lower total return swap expense in 2016, lower interest on funds withheld
expense and was partially offset by lower dividend income in 2016.
Fairfax recorded an income tax recovery of $160 million in 2016 and that was relative to a
pre-tax loss of $554 million producing an effective tax rate of 29%. We ended 2016 with
an investment portfolio including holding company cash of $28.4 billion compared to $29
billion at the end of 2015. The lower investment portfolio reflected net unrealized
depreciation of common stocks and net losses on derivatives partially offset by net
unrealized depreciation of bonds. Our total debt to total capital ratio increased to 28.7%
at the end of 2016 from 21.8% at the end of 2015 and that was primarily as a result of
debt issued during 2016 by Fairfax India and Cara, and that was to finance various
purchases and it was also reflective of the company's lower shareholders equity at the
end of 2016.
The proceeds from Fairfax's fourth quarter 2016 debt issuance a real mark to retire debt
that is already outstanding. So now Prem, I'll pass it back to you.

Thank you very much, Dave. Now, we're happy to answer your questions. Please give us
your name, your company name and try to limit your questions to only one all on the call.
So, Jen, we are ready for your questions.

Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session And our first question is
from the line of Junior Roth (27:40) a Private Investor. Your line is now open.

FINAL

Hi Prem, how is it going? Quick question, what do the CPI index need to go back to get
the price we paid for the equity?

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Sorry, give me that question again.

Q - Operator
So the CPI index right now is at a loss right, to get it back into a gain state. What does the
CPI index need to go to in the U.S. and Europe?

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Yeah. Dave, why don't you answer that?

A - David James Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. So we don't have those figures in front of us. But in our financial reporting, we do
give you all the index values on the CPI indices as to where the average was when we
stuck those contracts. So you can compare the two to where the index is at the current
point in time and get the answer to that question.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

And in terms of the indice0s, it's very close to where they are. But we might be in for a
period of inflation, as you saw the last numbers come out in the United States and so we'll
be watching it carefully. But as I said before, it's tremendous protection, it's got five or six
years to go, and we will be able to keep them.

Q - Operator
Okay. Thanks.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Next question please.

Operator
And our next question is from the line of Jeff Fenwick from Cormark Securities. Your line is
now open.

FINAL

Hi, Jeff.

Q - Jeffrey Fenwick
Just with the movement on the balance sheet this quarter, your debt-to-capital levels
capital levels moved up fairly meaningfully, I guess quarter-over-quarter here. I just
wanted to get your sense of level of comfort with where you're sitting there from a
capital position today, and is there any concern around that or any plans in terms of
offering incremental capital?

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Yeah, Jeff. We're focused right now to bring that back, back to where it was. We have
many, many possibilities of doing that. But of course, as Dave mentioned, it excludes debt
from our Fairfax India, Jeff. It includes debt from our subsidiaries, which is really not our
debt it's consolidated into our companies.

Bloomberg Transcript

Fairfax India, for example has every expectation to pay-off its debt by the end of March.
But we would get that much lower. If there is any truth to those rumors that I highlighted
for you, our debt equity comes back significantly.

Q - Jeffrey Fenwick
And then maybe just a question or two here on your investment positioning as you're
entering 2017. I mean, obviously significant change and you articulated that for us. Just
wondering around your concerns about market volatility. I mean it's certainly been a lot of
initial euphoria post the U.S. election. But we know that change takes time and those
changes as they emerge may be different than what people originally thought. And how
do you mange those risks in the near-term with respect to the pace of deploying that
capital out in the market?

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

So you know Jeff, when you think about it, there's always going to be volatility. I think of
going back few years now. 1965, the Dow Jones hit 1,000; 1982 it was still at 1,000, 17
years later. So there are long periods where the index might not go up significantly, but
individual companies and stocks do very well. So that's what we mean by saying it's a
stock pickers' market.
The last number of years that the stock markets have gone up. We're not expecting the
markets in general to do very well, but we think individual companies might do well, but
always subject to the value investing principles of margin of safety provide downside
protection, great management teams, we gave you Mosaic and Chorus in a quasi-

FINAL

convertible structure. So when we invest these monies, we'll be investing it in that way.
Are we going to have 20%, 30% fluctuations? Very much possible.
Then, never forget that the stocks that we have haven't done very well recently, especially
in 2016. And over time, we expect them to do well. We've got some investments in
Greece. I've talked about it in our annual report last year; I'll give you an update again. In
this year's annual report, we've got our investment in Blackberry, which is stable now. So
we've got these investments that we expect to do well. We don't expect them to go
down a lot from here. And so that's another reason for us to take our hedges off,
because the components of our stock positions have come down significantly already.

Q - Jeffrey Fenwick
Okay. And maybe just one last one, if I may, on Fairfax India, which is not having its own
call. Is there any update you can provide on the status of the Bangalore Airport
investment? I know that's been in the works for a long time and waiting for approval from
various agencies. Any update you can provide there?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Yeah. So very much, Jeff. The security clearance that we were waiting for, we have
obtained. And so now it's just a question of closing the transaction, which we do expect to
close in the next week or two. And it's working with the seller and his banks to make sure
that it works well for everyone concerned. But there is no hurdles now any longer after we
got the clearance, the security clearance. So it should close relatively soon. And we'll have
the 33% from the controlling shareholder. We'll have 5% from Zurich as we mentioned. So
we'll have 38% and I just came back from there. It's a wonderful airport. It's got
tremendous possibilities. It's running at about 20-plus million passengers today. Has all the
ability to go to 60 million. Bangalore as you know, is the Silicon Valley of India. And so
yeah, so we're very excited, it will happen hopefully in the next few weeks.

Q - Jeffrey Fenwick
Great. Thanks a lot, Prem.

FINAL

Good morning, Paul.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Good morning. Two questions if I may. First is a quick one. Would you happen to have
what the duration of your bond portfolio was say mid-2017 just to give us a sense of how
much you've reduced it in 2016?

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, Paul. We had very long bond portfolios. Our treasury bonds were mainly 30-year
treasury bonds. And we had California bonds, which were very long-term, and we had
some muni bonds, which had call features in it. So I don't have the duration, but they were
long. And once we decided we sold the 90% just recognizing the risk of the
administration change unexpectedly, which happened. And so, now, we basically have
sold the bonds, in the case of treasuries, all California's or we have locked them up with
the treasury lock, and so our duration is plus-minus a year, and the risk, as I said, in terms
of interest rates going up are eliminated.
I just want to highlight the reason we changed so dramatically. We just think we've always
thought what will make us change, and of course the good situation was if the markets
come down and we cover our hedges at a profit that would have been terrific. But we
also thought of the other side and the other side was if what happened happens. So in
our mind, the facts changed, and here are the facts. The new administration comes with
economic policies that are focused on reducing corporate taxes to 15% to 20%, as you
know; roll back regulation significantly; and regulation in business have been very heavy
over the last 8 years; and at a very significant infrastructure spending, which is exactly
what the United States needs. And so these are very powerful combination of policies.
I mentioned that it's already got animal spirits up in the United States. And so the
economic growth could take place there. And so in that set up, we thought if we had
known this earlier, you would say I'm rightly so, and when I say you, I mean generally, to
our shareholders, we perhaps if we had known that this type of thing could happen, we
should not have hedged even a few years ago. But of course, that was not possible. At
least for us, it wasn't possible to think through that potential. But as we saw it, we reacted
and we've taken it out, and now we are back to what we've done for 31 years and (37:24)
on our value-oriented basis. And as I said in our script, that we've made $10 billion over
that time period, cumulative gains. We expect in the next three years, four years, five
years to do as well in the position that we have. But that's what would be – our bond
portfolios are plus-minus one year.
So Paul, what's the next question you had, maybe I answered it?

Q - Paul Holden

FINAL

Yeah. So next question is in terms of that deployment of the $10 billion of cash you have
today, obviously, you have to do that in the context of risk-weighted assets in terms of
solvency ratios and your credit rating, insurance rating, et cetera, so maybe you can just
sort of help us think about the feasibility set in terms of asset class in terms of how you
can deploy that?

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Yeah. So the $10 billion will be capital as I said. But we liked the idea of buying bonds,
getting us 5%, 6%, 7% as we did with Mosaic and Chorus. Backing very strong teams, in
the case of Mosaic and Chorus. In Canada, we're well known. These companies are giving
us 20% or 50% of the shares outstanding. And you don't do that lightly if you are in
management. But they know we are friendly. We demonstrated over 31 years of always
being friendly, of always being supportive, and that's a big plus that we have.
Our culture is a huge plus. It's a differentiating factor between us and the other
companies that we compete with, in any industry I mean, So, you have in Canada, people
come all over the place for financing from us. They come to Paul Rivett, they come to
others. And insurance companies, I gave you a whole list, they've come to us to be part of
Fairfax because it's decentralized. They can run the company like they see fit. And we will
see similar things happening, Paul, in the United States. The U.S. is a big country, there is
all sorts of opportunity taking place, all sorts of entrepreneurs and for an entrepreneur
with a great track record and wants to expand in the U.S., we have the right partner for
them. And they will be amenable, they'll be sensitive and will work with us in structures
that work, like we did with Chorus and with Mosaic and I'll speak a lot more about this in
our Annual Report, yeah.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

FINAL

Prem, I'm just following up on Paul's question. If I look at equity, your common equity and
preferred equity plus your investment in associates, those are, I don't know, low-20s, 23%
say of your total portfolio. How high would you take that? Like traditionally, we don't see
insurance companies with much higher than 25% or 30% of their total portfolio invested in
equity and investments and associates?

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

No, that's right Tom and so somewhere around that 25% plus, minus is sort of the
maximum. But first of all our equities, we could – as they do well, we can sell them and
replace them with other investments that's happening as we speak, in terms of the stock
markets. But also the structure like a Chorus, where we have a convertible, but we split
them into a bond, which really as insurance companies have a lot of bonds, and a warrant,
which is five years or seven years, which perhaps has no value today, but has the upside if
the company does as well as we think it might. So that structure is very conducive to us. It
works really well. And so those are the type of things we're looking at doing that makes
sense for Fairfax.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

That's great. And just as a quick follow up. What do you hold ICICI Lombard on your
balance sheet at? I know you did increase your stake and the cost of that is disclosed, but
what do you hold to that?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

I think about $350 million plus or minus, we showed it there in our statements, and it's
about, we increased our stake, it was about $100 million Tom, and then we bought 9% to
10% at about $250 million, $240 million, something like that.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

And so our total investment I think is $350 million, and so that's what I was alluding to in
terms of those rumors.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Yeah. And I think in terms of Allied World, there's really around $2.7 billion more needed.
There is just talk about OMERS with a $1 billion you....

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Yeah. So, so.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}
Page 14 of 22



Company N ame: Fairfax Financial H oldings L td
Company Ticker: FFH CN Equity
Date: 2017-02-17

...so that $1.7 billion more. How comfortable are you in terms of raising that from
potentially like party?

FINAL

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

So, Tom, we've got $1 billion from OMERS and we've said in my prepared comments, I
said we're very confident of another $500 million, so that's $1.5 billion. That $1.5 billion
term, if we forgive Allied World shareholders in cash, that'll be like Brit, 70% Fairfax, 30%
partners. As we get another $1 billion, then it will be like 50% – 51% Fairfax, 49% partners,
so that's the split. We feel confident as I said for $1.5 billion, which is a 70-30 split. And if
we get the additional $1 billion, then we would be more like 50-50, 51% for us, 49% – we'll
always control the company. And we expect to retire this over time, just like we did. We
have the ability to buyback these shares, over time, five years, seven years basically.

Bloomberg Transcript

And so if we do a 70-30, and we've issued the 30%, the 30% 70-30, and then we've
issued some shares, the shares that we would issue on a 70-30 split term would be
approximately 23.5%. So that means, if we go over the $1.5 billion if you bear with me,
we're issuing $14 per share of Allied World in common shares and we're issuing the 30%
comes in cash, and the 70% would be in shares, a part of it will be in shares. And so, netnet Fairfax's shares outstanding will go up by 23.5%, if we only do $1.5 billion in financing
for that $30 a share. So everything in the company with Allied, as I've mentioned before,
goes up with third, the premiums go up by a third, the investment portfolio goes up by a
third, but the shares outstanding will only go up by 23.5%. If we get $2.4 billion, which
gives us 51%, then the shares outstanding go up by about only they go up by only 15%.
So if we have more cash come in, and that's not guaranteed as you know, but if we're
working with many partners as I've said, but if that does come in then the shares that we
would issue would be much less. In our minds, if that doesn't come in we'll just think of
using cash flows from Allied World to buy back our stock, that we would have issued in
excess of what we wanted to issue. So that's how we're thinking about it, but at the
moment it looks like our shares outstanding will be up by about 23.5%. But on March 3, is
when we have to announce how much cash, how much shares and we will do that on that
date.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay. And how come you can't use any of this or why won't you be able to use substantial
amount of this $10 billion in cash? Is that just because it sits in operating insurance
subsidiaries that's hard to pull out?

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Yes, it sits with our insurance companies at the time it sits in Allied insurance companies
mainly in the United States, but all over the world and we'll invest that, because a lot of
that was invested in and most of that was invested in our bond portfolios. And so the
interest rates are going up some, so cash is not a bad thing to have, five-year treasuries
are at 2% in that area, so we will – we get some interest income but over time we will be
investing that as I said earlier.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

And sorry what was the significance of the March 3 date, sorry, what's that?

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

FINAL

March 3rd is the date when we have to let Allied World shareholders know that $30 in
cash or shares, how much is going to be in cash, how much is going to be in shares.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

So the way to look at Allied World is to think of it as fully funded. It's either cash or shares
and the only the point we have make on March 3 is that whether it's going to be in the –
whether we're going to put $1.5 billion in cash or $2 billion in cash or $2.5 billion in cash that
we have to announce then and then subject to regulatory approval sometime in the
second quarter, maybe late in the second quarter is when the approvals are that we
expect to come.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Thanks for that Prem.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Mark Dwelle from RBC Capital Markets.
Your line is now open.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Yeah. Good morning. We've already covered a lot of the investing and financing type of
questions. I just wanted to ask a couple of others. There were a little bit more operational,
could you provide the amount in total of cat losses and favorable developments in the
quarter? Just in dollar terms your points whatever is easiest?

A - David James Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

I can do that for you. So, in the fourth quarter we had 12.9 points of favorable
developments in our combined ratio and that would and then for the year-to-date that
would be 8.5 points. And in terms of dollars, $257 million in the quarter, $655 million in the
year of favorable development. And if you're looking at cat losses 5 points, 4 points of cat
losses in the fourth quarter, 4.6 points of cat losses year-to-date.

FINAL

Thank you. That's very helpful. And then the second question I had was, the net written
premium volume at Brit fell off fairly substantially in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year
basis. And I was wondering if there was any change there. I know the pricing has been
under pressure for Brit, but that was a much steeper decline than we suggested by just
pricing alone?

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Yeah. Pricing is under pressure. Yeah, but not huge, 0% to 5% in all our companies across
the world. Some closer to flat, some closer to 2% or 3%, and some are little more. In the
case of Brit, in that direct insurance businesses, it might have been down 2.9% Mark and
the reinsurance business like 4.5%, 5% in terms of pricing. So they are charged to all
insurance companies, is not to focus on the top line. And if they had to reduce it, they'll
reduce it. We don't even think twice about that.

Bloomberg Transcript

And so, we're not focused on premium at all. We're focused on combined ratios. And
good reserving and I can tell you at the end of the year, our reserves are very good and in
very good shape and our management teams all over the world are very much focused
on underpinning and on an underwriting basis, we've had an outstanding year. Another
very good year, and our reserves are in good shape, and so we are writing $10 billion in
gross premium all over the world and with all these different management groups that
have been with us for a long time, I must say that's a very stable operation and Scott
Carmilani and Allied World, they've run it for 15 years that's going to be such a good fit.
It's going to no integration problems, no synergies that we expect from them, in terms of
cost synergies, but of course in terms of revenue synergies over time. We expect that will
take place, but no-cost synergies. You'll never hear us talk about $100 million, $200 million
of synergies and we think that's a huge plus. And I'll remind you, Allied World had a return
on equity of 12% over the last 15 years.
And if you look at their 10-year returns on their investment portfolios, it was approximately
3.9%, I think it is Peter, and our 10-year returns even in spite of not good returns in the last
5 years, 10-year returns are approximately 7%. And you put our 7% on the combined ratios
and you get a 20% return on equity. That 12% becomes 20%. That's basically how Fairfax
was built. And it will continue to be the case over time.
And so as I said that it was a painful quarter, painful year. But I want to reassure our
shareholders, we are very focused on doing well for you. We've done really well for you
over a long period of time. But I'm the first to recognize that we haven't done well for you
in the last 5 years and we'll make that up for you over time. Mark, any other questions you
had?

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Just one other last quick one. The Fairfax Africa investment, I assume that's going to
appear on the results in the reported balance sheet and so forth in a pretty similar
manner to the Fairfax India Holding?

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Yes, yes. It will come – it will have its own statements of course, and like Fairfax India now,
which will have a second annual meeting, and by the way I'm going to welcome all of you
for our annual meeting not only Fairfax Financial, but Fairfax India's annual meeting, which
is in the afternoon, and you will see and meet a lot of the management team who run our
Indian companies and they're very, very impressive. We all had a chance to do that, our
management team and our board of directors about a few weeks ago. But we'll bring
them in and we'll have a presentation, you'll have a chance.
We're really quite excited in terms of our investments in India, and it's difficult to see. Mark
you've done a really good job in understanding the Fairfax India, but the potential in that
country is huge. And we have the better part in Fairfax India; the better part of $2 billion
invested there; and then our other investments like ICICI Lombard and other – Thomas
Cook and all of those, they add up to about $3 billion. So we have about $5 billion, not on
a cost basis because we've done very well on it, but in terms of market, approximately $5
billion invested in India. And we think the returns over time is going to be significant.

Q - Mark Dwelle

Q - Mikel Abasolo

{BIO 3756596 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions again. And my first question
does have to do with the removal of your Russell 2000 hedges. And my question to you
is, I mean, in my mind, even if the new U.S. administration orchestrated a miracle or even if
they were as good as Cardoso in Brazil or Modi in India, don't you think that our wages of
evaluation of the U.S. stock market and particularly, Russell 2000 with two-thirds of the
company is making a loss will definitely overwhelm the potential or the marginal
improvement in the prospect of U.S. companies coming from better policies if they
manage to actually orchestrate better policies. So my question and I fully understand...

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

FINAL

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Yeah. It's a good question and the markets are not cheap. I grant you that. I said that in
our prepared comments. So you're exactly right. And some of you might wonder and
might actually think that we're doing it at exactly the wrong time. And this is of course
what makes investing such a great business because there's all sorts of opinions and all
sorts of views. Our view was just that these are very significant policy changes. If they
come to place and they might not come into place, cutting in corporate tax, dropping
corporate taxes to the 15%-20% area is huge. If it's instituted and your point might well be
that, and many of you have said, that it might not take place.
The rollback in regulation, Obamacare, Dodd-Frank, all of these regulations you take them
back, America is always based on business. And when you open it up for business again
and these animals spirits come back, and then you throw in the infrastructure spending
and some of you might have a chance to review the 50 infrastructure projects that are
already explained.

Bloomberg Transcript

And you read just a few of them, and they are very, very significant. And so I mean, you
put all of that, the profit margins are high, but tax rates coming down is going have a
significant impact on profits. Economic growth will have a significant impact. They're talking
3% or 4% economic growth. The confidence factor, the animal spirits is another factor. So
when I look at it, Mikel, I'm saying the markets might not go up significantly in the next five
years or 10 years, who knows right.
But there might be individual names, that go up and individual companies that do well.
And there will be fluctuations, 20%-30% fluctuations all the time. And so we want to
identify the companies that do well and the risks are very clearly, the world trade collapse
because of the some of the policies that's being talked about. The rest are about Europe
and the Brexit going right through plans and Holland and other countries, and of course,
China is always a potential risk.
So you have that risk. That's one of the reasons we've got the deflation swaps. We're
keeping $110 billion, which is in our books I think less than $100 million. So it's not a big
item there, but if any of these risks come to play, our deflation swaps will be worth a lot.
And on the other side, we think because (58:58) $20 trillion economy is factoring well.
Yeah, so, $20 trillion economy does well. A lot of these risk, perhaps, not eliminated, but
reduced. So, that's where what we think, Mikel, but only time will tell, okay, but we
appreciate your question, it's a good question.
Jen, next question, please?

FINAL

Q - Operator
Yes, hello, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Well, I just wanted to ask you, I
mean, you already mentioned but I wanted to ask you again. Given your long-term plan of
growing book value per share of 15%, how do you think, we can compensate for the last
six years of kind of like zero growth, and are we still in plan? And basically what's your view
on the future of Fairfax kind of like the same question?

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, I mean, that's a very good point. We haven't done well, as we said last five years or
six years, and the question is, your question can we compensate for that? Only time will
tell if we can or not. We used to think that we could compensate with the treasury bonds
and our government bond portfolio, which as I've told you we made $2.3 billion of gains.
We could have made perhaps a little more. We thought we could compensate on the
hedges. But remember we've got a whole bunch of equity positions that are not showing
any profits today.
For example, Eurobank; for example, Blackberry. They're all valued at market and I can
make I think some scenarios where that would be very different from where it is today. If
you were to take those equity portfolios, common stocks were three but quiet. And you
could make a scenario where there'll be valued a lot higher than they valued today. Today
this is where they are. This is the vitality of it, but they're not selling it. And so, we've taken
the heads on the hedges. We've made a lot of money on the bond portfolios, but not
made more than perhaps we could have. And now, our focus is trying to do well and only
time will tell if we can compensate for the lack of progress as you said in the last five
years plus.
Let me tell you this, Louis. If you think of intrinsic values, if you think of what we have built
over that time period, if you think of the individual companies that I'm making an
underwriting profit year after year after year, you are going to think that the intrinsic value
of Fairfax's are a lot higher than what it is today, and I have no question about that.
On the investment side, we've demonstrated a scale for a long period of time, you are
exactly right, we haven't done that in the last five years to six years, well you're going to
see that change in the future. We've got the same team. There's no difference in our
team, but the intrinsic value and book value tend to go together over time while I would
suggest to you that right now that our intrinsic value of our companies is significantly
higher than what the book value indicates. Some of the reasons which you have alluded
to.
So thank you for that question, Louis and I'll move on, Jen, to the next question.

Q - Mikel Abasolo

{BIO 3756596 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you. So sorry for taking some time from you and I hate to do this question, but
it's kind of significant to me. I know that part of your success in the past and most likely in
the future comes from your reputation as a fair and loyal partner. And my question is an
uncomfortable one, because I wanted to ask you about the deliberate support that Fairfax
did to a corporate action by your Greek Holding Mytilineos over its affiliate METKA.
I think that transaction is an outright abuse of minority shareholders of METKA and I
wanted to ask you how come Fairfax actively supported that? And full disclosure, you
know we're a shareholders of Fairfax India and also of Mytilineos and of METKA. So, we're
an interested third-party, but we were very disappointed to see that you were involved in
that. Thank you.

No, thank you for that question and if you will send me an e-mail, I'll make sure that we
have our guys who specialize in it, in Mytilineos and they have reviewed it. They think it's
fair, we want to give you our perspective as a shareholder. So that you would understand
it. You might not agree with it, but you'll understand it. And we'd be happy to share that
with you, if you send us your e-mail, okay?
