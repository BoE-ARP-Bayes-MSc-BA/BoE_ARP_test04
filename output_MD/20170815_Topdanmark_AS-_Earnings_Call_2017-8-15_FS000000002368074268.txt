MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good afternoon. Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Topdanmark H1 2017
Results Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. There will be a
presentation followed by a question-and-answer session. I must advise you, this
conference is being recorded today on Tuesday, the 15th of August 2017.
I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Christian Sagild.
Please go ahead, sir.

Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

Good afternoon, everybody, and good morning to the U.S.A. And thank you for joining us
in this conference call. With me are our CFO, Lars Thykier; and Steﬀen Heegaard, who's
Head of Investor Relations and Group Communications. We're holding this conference
because, earlier today, we published our results for the ﬁrst half of 2017.
And we are ready now to answer your questions. Please ask them one at a time.
Operator, could we have the ﬁrst question, please?

Q&A
Operator

FINAL

Thank you. Your ﬁrst question comes from the line of Jakob Brink from Nordea. Please ask
your question.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Hello. I have three questions, please. I'll ask them one at a time. The ﬁrst one is regarding
what you mentioned about negative average premium growth in the motor segment.
Could you maybe elaborate a bit more on that please, also, given what we have heard
from some of your competitors and as discussed in earlier conference calls regarding
claims inﬂation in motor? Yeah. I'll wait for the second question.

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

We have seen our average motor premium drop. Although we have an increase in the
number of car insurances, we have a drop of 0.3% in the top line, stemming from this fact.
And if you look at average premium, just to give you an example, from 2011 to 2017, the
average motor premium has dropped from DKK 4,221 million to DKK 3,790 million. That is
the average earned premium in motor insurance. So, that is the development.
And if you take the pure risk premium on the motor premium, it is quite stable with a
small drop from around DKK 2,200 million down to DKK 2,156 million. So, in the last year,
risk premium has stabilized, but the average premium that we sell insurances for has
dropped with this eﬀect on the top line. But as I said, and as we stated also last quarter,
we see the stabilization. We don't see a further drop in the underlying risk premium.

A - Steﬀen Peter Anker Heegaard

{BIO 1513480 <GO>}

What you also see is that the drop in the average premium is decreasing from quarter-toquarter.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. And my second question regarding this 5 percentage points additional
positive claims trend from Q2 to Q2. You mentioned also lower ﬁre claims in private and
commercial. Is that really the main driver of this? I'm thinking about it's been a quite rainy
summer, so I guess, there's been quite a few ﬁres overall in Denmark. Is that based to
what is driving it, or is there something we should extrapolate in addition to the eﬃciency
program? And in that case, how much does the eﬃciency program can make up of the 5
percentage points?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

I would advise you not to extrapolate. What we have seen is somewhat better
development in private lines. We have had very good run on content. Theft has been low
for some reason. The electronic claims has been lower, and so on, but that's not where

Page 2 of 14

FINAL

the main reason is. Main reason is on the SME and agriculture segment, where we, for
some reason, have had close to none ﬁres (04:33) in the quarter we have just seen.
And this means that in ﬁrst place, we don't have to pay for the buildings and the content
in the buildings that we expect to see burn (04:36). We don't have to pay the
consequential losses on proﬁts, either. And that means that the claims ratio on the (05:02)
side has fallen from – the claims trend is substantially lower now than it were last year, and
that is mainly due to ﬁre.

A - Steﬀen Peter Anker Heegaard

{BIO 1513480 <GO>}

But the very good development in Q2 has not led to a conclusion to change our guidance
for the rest of the year.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Fair enough. And then, sorry, just a very ﬁnal small question regarding the dividend and
the solvency. You write some place that you do not deduct the dividend from the own
capital. Why is that, again? I think we discussed it last quarter.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

The main reason is that we don't know the size of the dividend. And we understand that
you have to deduct the expected dividend in banks at least. But we don't have an
expected dividend level, yet, and we are not forced to deduct it in insurance.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Okay. Fair enough. Many thanks.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

Welcome.

Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Paul De'Ath from RBC. Please ask
your question.

Q - Paul De'Ath
Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks. I have a couple of questions. So, ﬁrst one, just sticking with the
solvency ratio, I noticed the SCR has gone down by around DKK 600 million in 2Q.
Maybe you can give any detail on sort of what the main moving parts are there that's
brought that down. And then secondly, just touching, again, on the combined ratio and,
particularly, the loss ratio – so, you say not to extrapolate this. I mean, ﬁrstly, are we
looking at Q2 as a one-oﬀ extremely positive quarter and, therefore, we should kind of
take that out of our next year forecasts in terms of where the combined ratio can go from
here? Thanks.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

FINAL

So, I may comment on the solvency. It is around DKK 550 million. And the brunt of this
change is – all rises in the life company. In the premium losses in the life company, the
customers pay the major part of the loss. The higher the customer-owned buﬀers are, the
bigger part of the losses will heed (07:48) to customers and the smaller the part, they will
heed (07:51) the shareholders equity. We have had a rise in interest rates, which means
that the guarantees has become less onerous.
At the same time, we've had a good return and we have de-risked somewhat. And all
these factors increase the buﬀers. To put it diﬀerently, the loss absorption (08:13) capacity
of the life company has increased, thereby decreasing the SCR for the shareholders.
We've had some de-risking in the non-life company as well.

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

Commenting on the combined ratio for Q2, you asked, to what extent probably this could
be prolonged. And I'd say, we had for many years been working with risk-based prices.
And we are always trying to set good premiums for good risks. If there is any eﬀect on
that in the Q2 result, it's very, very diﬃcult to sort of ﬁlter out. So, we tend to think that it is
coincidental that we have this very proﬁtable Q2. And this is why we state that we haven't
changed our underlying approach to how the commercial and agriculture segments will
develop in the coming quarters.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

I would like to add that, we do have expectations about our claims ratio in the reforecast
period. Since 2010, we have had higher claims in the SME market than we had expected.
We had an increase in level from 2010 going forward, and we don't' really know why. So,
you can pay both ways. Sometimes, it is more expensive than we expect. Sometimes it is
better than we expect. This time was better.

Q - Paul De'Ath
Okay. Thanks.

Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Janet Demir from Morgan Stanley.
Please ask your question.

Q - Janet Demir

{BIO 19462264 <GO>}

Hi. I have two questions, please. I'm just curious, given your solvency ratio is very strong, I
know that you don't give as far as solvency ratio, but just wondering how we should think
about how you will look at the dividend at year end. Let's say, should you decide that the
capital is higher than you need it to be, so would you be comfortable paying, let's say,
more than 100% of earnings out as dividend?

Page 4 of 14



Company Name: Topdanmark AS
Company Ticker: TOP DC Equity
Date: 2017-08-15

FINAL

And then secondly, can you give us a feel for what a normal quarter would be in terms of
large losses? So, I'm talking, in terms of the combined ratio or an absolute number,
because I note that you were saying, for example, in the SME segment that you have
larger losses than expected in previous years. And perhaps the last few years have been
lighter than expected. So, what should we expect going forward for large losses? Thank
you.

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

It is, of course, a very comfortable solvency ratio that we announced now. And basically, it
is for the reason that Lars just mentioned the movements in the underlying solvency ratio
– SCR, and of course, the fact that we have produced surplus that has been adding to the
sort of solvency ratio.
We have published the dividend policy last quarter, stating minimum 70%. And minimum
is still the keyword, because we don't have any ambition to build up unnecessary capital
in the company. So, unless we have something interesting to spend the money on, I don't
know why we should keep it very long in our pockets. So, minimum 70% means that we
could expect with a very nice solvency ratio that it will be more than 70%.

Q - Janet Demir

{BIO 19462264 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

On the big losses, the normalized, was that the other question?

Q - Janet Demir

{BIO 19462264 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

I mean, if you take – we have made a slide in our presentation, take that slide 39, showing
2015, 2016, and 2017 quarterly large-scale claims. And the full year 2015 was DKK 100
million, the full year 2016 was DKK 129 million, and half year now is DKK 4 million. So, if
anything would be normal, it would probably be in the range of DKK 100 million to DKK
120 million. But this is not a guidance.

Q - Janet Demir

{BIO 19462264 <GO>}

Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

Yeah.

Autonomous Research. Please ask your question.

FINAL

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Good afternoon, everyone. I've got two questions, please. Considering how strong your
results were in the ﬁrst half, I was wondering whether that does anything to your pricing
strategy, i.e., are you still happy to price in line with expected claims inﬂation, or would
you rather grow a bit faster and settle for a slightly higher combined ratio? And secondly,
could you just give us some more details around the eﬃciency improvements you talked
about in your interim report? Thank you.

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

When we listen to our competitors and their half-year results, we hear that they have not
seen the same favorable developments in the SME and the agricultural segment as we
have. So we think, and have heard, that maybe some of our competitors are in for some
price increases in these segments. So, we don't feel any urge to change our pricing
structure right now. We feel comfortable with the levels we're at, and that goes for both
private and commercial and agricultural sector. We don't have any very signiﬁcant price
initiatives in the drawer.
And when it comes to our expected combined ratio in the future, we're aiming now for an
87. That's our guidance for the full year, not including run-oﬀ results in the second half.
This, of course, is better than our target, but we also expect that with the more normalized
weather conditions and with the more normalized large-scale and ﬁre claims, we would
be more in range with our sort of standard goals of 90, 91 combined, excluding any runoﬀ. So, to conclude, we don't have any signiﬁcant price initiatives in the drawer right now.
We would rather use the opportunity that may arise from our competitors having to
increase prices.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

Okay. Understood. Thank you.

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

The second question was relating...

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

Eﬃciency.

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

We're working on the eﬃciency side, but in the same time, we are investing in
digitalization and automatization. And that means that we're saving on one side, and we
Page 6 of 14



Company Name: Topdanmark AS

Date: 2017-08-15

are spending on one side. To give you an idea about the eﬃciency improvements, I
suppose that the head count at Topdanmark will be at least 200 persons less at year-end
2017 than it were at year-end 2015.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. And so, how much are we talking about in the second half of this year then?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

That depend on what kind of calculation you want to make. We are saving a lot on head
count, but we're spending this money on developing our automatization and our
digitalization. That's why we have seen a slight decrease in expense ratio in spite of
increasing taxes and increasing salaries.

Q - Youdish Chicooree

{BIO 17430923 <GO>}

All right. Understood. Thank you very much.

Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Per Grønborg from SEB. Please ask
your question

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Per Grønborg
Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. Just have a single or two questions left on my note. First,
on the cost side, can you give us any indication where should we expect that to be? And
you're clearly delivering signiﬁcantly more this quarter than I think most of us had
expected, so some indication of a number would be very nice.
My second question relates to the corporate segment where you write in the report that
you have increased the sales provisions due to higher new sales, still your top line is
going down in the second quarter. What are you seeing on the corporate side volumewise? What are you seeing competition-wise? Can you put some ﬂavor on that? Thank
you.

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

Eﬃciency?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

We have been very reluctant to give precise bids on how the expenses are developing
from quarter to quarter. There'll be some lumps in expenses where we see increases and
decreases between quarters. But basically, I think you should expect the expense ratio to
move a little lower during the next year or so.

Q - Per Grønborg
Page 7 of 14



Company Name: Topdanmark AS
Company Ticker: TOP DC Equity
Date: 2017-08-15

What you are saying is that we should not extrapolate the very good Q2. Is that correct?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

No, no, no.

FINAL

Q - Per Grønborg
Yeah. Okay. Thank you.

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

Regarding the development in corporate premiums, it was ﬂattish in Q2 – or in the ﬁrst
half year, and there were some diﬀerent eﬀects. Of course, there is an eﬀect from the fact
that we lost the last major client which had a negative eﬀect. And this has been oﬀset by a
higher level of sales. And these new sales some of them were actually in-force, some of
them are waiting to come in-force in the second half of 2017, but we still have to pay
commission. So that is one of the eﬀect. And the other eﬀect is that we've had some
bonus payments on our captive, which reduces the top line.

Q - Per Grønborg
Okay. What are you seeing competition-wise? Protect (18:45), I guess, is not that visible in
the market any longer?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

True. We don't see the same type of competition that we saw last year at the same time.
So, they have, as I understand, stated that they are looking somewhat diﬀerent at the
Danish market when it comes to pricing. So, that is of, course, nice.

Q - Per Grønborg
Should we see that now, or will that – or are most of these contract renewed 1st of January,
so this primarily will be an 2018 eﬀect, or it's hard to guess in what they are doing when
you get to the renewal season?

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

We don't feel the same pressure from customers leaving us. And I think when we take our
market, which is in the lower SME market. January 1 is less of a signiﬁcant date for in-force
as in new in-force date.

Q - Per Grønborg
Okay. Perfect. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Jonny Urwin from UBS. Please ask your
question.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

FINAL

Hi, there. Thanks. Okay, there's just two from me. So, ﬁrstly, I wondered if you're seeing
any sort of eﬀects on your competitive positioning from Tryg's customer dividend model.
It doesn't look like it in the results today, but just some color there would be great. And
secondly, could you give us a feel for where you're seeing claims inﬂation run at the
moment on property, motor, in particular, and where pricing is relative to that? That'd be
great. Thank you.

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

The fresh answer to the Tryg bonus program is actually, no. We don't see any signiﬁcant
eﬀect, but the real answer is that we don't really know to what extent it has to do with
bonus programs, or when it has to do with other pricing factors. But we can see in the ﬁrst
half that we have a net inﬂow of customers comparing to Tryg. So, in that sense, we
haven't been hit that hard from a bonus program.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

So, in claims inﬂation, if we look at motor, we still see that the development in third-party
liability is benign, while we see increases above the indexation on comprehensive. In
property, we see more losses on tubing than we expected, and that may be regarded as
claims inﬂation. On the other hand, the development in other lines has improved. So,
basically, we are not concerned about the total claims in inﬂation.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Can you give us any rough indication of numbers to that?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

The indexation next will be 1.6%, and we think that, that's probably a good starting point.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Okay. And pricing is largely attracting that?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

Not on motor, where the price decreases we've made are still rolling through the
portfolio. So, we'll see average prices come down in motor. Besides that, our pricing will
follow the claims inﬂation.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Great. Thanks very much.

Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Asbjørn Mørk from Danske Bank.
Please ask your question.

Company Name: Topdanmark AS
Company Ticker: TOP DC Equity
Date: 2017-08-15

Q - Asbjørn Nicholas Mørk

FINAL

Yes. A couple of questions from my side. First on the top line, I was just wondering,
Christian, what you said regards the new sales and the fact that you reiterate your top line
communication for the full year. It looks to me as, all things equal, there should be some
momentum in the second half of the year or some possible spillover? Is that correctly
understood?

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

The eﬀect of some of the larger clients leaving us will have eﬀect in all of 2016 if you
compare 2017 to 2016. So, you have to oﬀset that eﬀect from more sales. And this is what
we actually did in the commercial segment. And that has led to more payment of
commissions. When it comes to top line, we still say slightly positive, but there was this
one-oﬀ eﬀect in Q1, which had a positive impact in Q1 of – probably was a 0.8%, 0.9% out
of 1.7% growth rate in Q1. The growth rate in Q2 is 0.6%; so, now, it's averaged 1.2%, but
holds in that an amount of one-oﬀ eﬀect. So, we still think that growth rate in the second
half will be somewhat lower than what we've seen in the ﬁrst half.

Q - Asbjørn Nicholas Mørk
Okay. Fair enough. Another question on the cost side, was just curious if you're seeing
any wage inﬂation or anything like that increasing, I mean, in terms of competition over
key employees, or whether the eﬃciency program that you have means that you don't
really need to ﬁght for key employees going forward?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

That is a problem, of course. We have solved that – or we have got ourselves some relief
by moving some of these tasks out as outsourced. But we think that the automation and
eﬃciency improvements we make will at least make up for this pressure.

Q - Asbjørn Nicholas Mørk
Okay, then if I can ask a second question on that. So, leaving aside eﬃciency, how do you
see your total inﬂation on the cost side on an annual basis right now?

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

I mean, that's not a ﬁgure that we make up as such. We expect to see an increase in
salaries to the tune of 1.8% plus, say, 0.7% on top of the forced increases.

A - Christian Sagild

All things equal, yeah.

Q - Asbjørn Nicholas Mørk
Okay. Thanks. And then, on the Tryg custom bonus, you said that you were actually
gaining customers from Tryg. I was just wondering, does this mean that you need to give
a discount to sort of attract these customers and, thereby, your combined ratio of these
customers will be weaker, or is that not really the case?

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

We are selling to Tryg's customers in the same way we sell to all other customers, so it is
the standard pricing structure that we use. But of course, we don't have exactly the same
approach to pricing everywhere in Denmark. So, it's not that you need to go – to
compromise with your tariﬀs in order to gain a customer. We can have diﬀerent approach,
because we don't micro rate in the exact same manner. But, nevertheless, we can see that
Page 11 of 14



Company Name: Topdanmark AS
Company Ticker: TOP DC Equity
Date: 2017-08-15

our competition is such that we gain more customers; but it changes from time-to-time
and in the sales force you do have some allowance. They allow to give some discount
within certain regulations in order to attract customers, but that doesn't apply especially
to Tryg.

Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Vinit Malhotra from Mediobanca.
Please ask your question.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Hi. Thank you. Just one, maybe, follow-up or maybe clariﬁcation more than anything
else; apologies, I missed some part of the call. The 5 point Q2-to-Q2 additional
underlying improvement in the claims ratio, in the report it has been mentioned that it is
due to property theft and other factors. Could you just shed a bit more light? And if you
did already, I apologize. I missed part of the call. But if you could comment on that 5
points, it would be great. And second question is on the motor. You commented that
you're cutting prices. You said that there is no major trend in claims inﬂation that you are
observing, or any update on accident frequency or any other comment would be very
useful. Thank you very much.

A - Lars Thykier

{BIO 16427122 <GO>}

The 5 percentage points is basically due to – or the brunt of this is very few ﬁres. We have
had a good run on theft as well. The claims inﬂation in motor is impacted by higher claims
on comprehensive and lower claims on third-party liability.

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

And we do think...

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

And no worsening (28:45) in motor – sorry.

A - Christian Sagild

{BIO 15093649 <GO>}

All over in motor, we think that the claims development will be dealt with by the tax
indexation, so we don't feel the need for additional price increases as we have heard
some of competitors talking about.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

And sorry, just to follow up, this has been the stance in motor even last quarter. So that
means, implies that nothing has changed in your view in 2Q.
