Hello, good morning and thank you, Andrew. So let me begin by making some remarks
about the UK transactions that we have announced and then give you an overview of the
main ﬁgures for the ﬁrst quarter of the year before moving, of course, to the Q&A.
So as you noticed AXA announced today that following a strategic review conducted by
AXA UK of the UK Life & Savings market, it has agreed to sell its wrap platform business,
Elevate, to Standard Life plc. This transaction follows the announcement made on April 28
for the disposal of its UK oﬀshore investment bond business which is called AXA Isle of
Man.
AXA also conﬁrms that it is engaged in discussions for the disposal of its remaining UK
Life & Savings assets i.e. its direct protection business called SunLife. AXA UK P&C, Health
i.e. PPP and asset management related operations, Architas, are not included and remain
key businesses for us.

Bloomberg Transcript

We expect total proceeds from this transaction at around €800 million and to generate an
exceptional negative P&L impact of circa minus €0.4 billion accounted for in net income.
As previously communicated we also expect to realize an exceptional gain of circa €1
billion after tax on the disposal of the two real properties in the U.S. which will be
accounted for in net income during the ﬁrst half of 2016.
So now let me move to an overview of the ﬁgures of the ﬁrst quarter. We had continued to
see growth in revenue this quarter with total revenues up 1% on a comparable basis to
€32 billion. On Life & Savings, we recorded a plus 16% APE growth and this growth
includes higher corporate pension scheme sales in the UK of €0.3 billion if we excluded
UK Life sales then the overall APE growth would have been ﬂat.
The high Unit-Linked sales in the UK were oﬀset by Hong Kong due to the non repeat of
the exceptional sale of large contracts and high carryover sales in Q1 2015 in anticipation
of the change in regulation implemented in 2015.
Also worth noting are the high sales of G/A Savings single premium business in China as
part of the Chinese New Year marketing campaign. These seasonal sales were higher than
last year for (3:41) the remainder of the year we expect to sell the higher margin regular
premium business in China and we would expect the overall NBV margin for the year for
China to be somewhere between 10% and 15% similar to last year.
The NBV margin at 29% remains high. The decline compared to the ﬁrst quarter 2015
reﬂects for the most part the higher corporate pension scheme sales in the UK in the
quarter which have a slower NBV – a lower NBV margin. If we restated the numbers to
exclude the UK Life & Savings business then the NBV margin for the group would have
been around 36%.
Life & Savings net inﬂows for the quarter were at €3 billion and this includes around €0.5
billion outﬂows from the most recent GMxB buyout in the U.S. which operates from
December 2015 to March 2016.

FINAL

P&C revenue, P&C revenues were up 3% mainly driven by a positive pricing eﬀect of 3.4%
on average. In mature markets, revenues increased by 1% driven by the UK, Ireland,
Germany, with higher volume and prices.
In high-growth markets, revenues were up 9%. This was driven by Turkey where we
signiﬁcantly increased pricing from April 2015 to restore the proﬁtability of our portfolio
and business growth in Mexico and Malaysia. Excluding Turkey, revenue growth in the
high-growth markets was 4%. Direct revenues grew at 7% driven by Japan, the UK and
France.
Let's speak now from asset management. Asset management business total inﬂows were
€10 billion with AXA IM at €8 billion mainly from Asian JVs and AB at €2 billion mainly
from institutional clients. Average AUM dropped 4% driven by the withdrawal of assets
from Friends Life in 2015 explaining roughly 3% drop in AUM.
And revenues dropped 9% due to lower asset under management ﬁrst and the decrease
in average management fees linked to a higher share of ﬁxed income products following
weak equity markets in the ﬁrst two months of the year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our economic solvency ratio is estimated at 200%, down 5 points versus December
(6:30) 2015. The impact of adverse market condition was partially oﬀset by a positive
operating return and the issuance of a €1.5 billion subordinated debt. As disclosed in full
year 2015 results, our Solvency II ratio now includes an estimated dividend accrual for the
period estimated based on one-fourth of last year dividend.
I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that we plan to share with you our new
strategy plan during our IR Day in Paris on June 21st.
I'm now happy to answer your questions.

Q&A
Operator
And we have a – our ﬁrst question from Peter Eliot from Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go
ahead, sir.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you very much. First question, I want to ask, I guess now that we've had the detail
(7:29) from the Department of Labor, I was wondering if you can give us an update on
your view of the impact that that will have. And perhaps also, on the U.S. now that the sort
of the mark to the second phase of the buyouts are over, just wondering if you could
share, whether you have any intentions to do anything else there?

And then ﬁnally just on the Southeast Asia, India and China you said that the margin was
down due to the business mix and high Chinese sales, but I guess that the value of new
business was also down quite a lot. So I'm just wondering if it was something other than
just an extra of (8:11) the high volume of low margin business. Can you comment a little bit
more on that? Thank you very much.

A - Gérald Harlin
Yes, Peter. So let's start with DOL. So it's quite obvious and I believe that most U.S. players
noticed that DOL was slightly better than we could fear. Remember that we mentioned at
the last presentation of the accounts at the end of February that it would be between 10%
and 30%. So we could say roughly speaking that the impact on the U.S. new business
might be 20%. So, a slightly better than again than we could fear. And I believe that we'll
give you more detail about the U.S. and the impact on the U.S. on 21 of June.
The buyout, do we intend to do other buyouts? I believe that we can expect now that it's
diﬃcult for me to tell you. I don't expect in the foreseeable future to have other buyouts
but I believe that we'll present it more globally with our U.S. strategy.

Bloomberg Transcript

About China, so it's true and quite obvious that in the ﬁrst three months, we had a strong
growth and a strong production in China and which was clearly in General Account
business and with an NBV margin which was negative. It was an NBV margin of minus 6%.
Why? Because you know in the way – ﬁrst of all in China in the, for the ﬁrst three months,
that means that around the Chinese New Year like we did in the past but this year it's
more important the massive marketing campaigns and which are quite important in order
for ICBC to increase its market base.
And that's what we did and that's the reason why we had a quite attractive product in the
ﬁrst part of the year. But I can tell you that in April we had we produced new products with
an NBV margin between 15% and 20%. And on a cumulative basis at the end of April, we
are positive in term of global NBV. So it's absolutely in line with what we explained to you
which is that, in the ﬁrst three months we have a General Accounts production which is
ﬂows to zero or even negative which is the case today, ﬁrst.
And second, for the rest of the year, we can expect to produce other type of products
which are not pure (10:57) savings product but which are much more whole life products
with higher margin. And as a whole, we can expect to have a margin for the whole year
between 10% and 15%. So again, these ﬁgures are reﬂect this very strong marketing
campaign that we did. I can tell you that in the end we didn't pay any goodwill for our
business in China. And for us, being the number 10 so quickly in China in Life is a good
success. So that means that it's something which was expected and it's a good news for
us because it's a way for us to increase our footprint in China.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks a lot.

So we have another question from Paul De'Ath from RBC.

FINAL

Q - Paul De'Ath
Yeah, hi. Good morning. Couple of questions if I can on the UK transaction. And I think
ﬁrstly I guess just looking at it thoughtfully outside on the face of it the UK Life market
should be one that ﬁts well with the sort of AXA strategy of selling more Unit-Linked and
less guaranteed products and that kind of thing. So I'm just interested to know kind of
what it was within the strategic review that made you think that that actually the UK wasn't
the place that you want to grow the business.
And secondly on linked to that point just looking at the Q1 sales, so the institutional
Pensions business that you sold in the UK, where does that ﬁt within the Life and Pensions
businesses that you're selling or indeed is it part of the asset management business that
you're holding on to and probably get back (13:02)?

A - Gérald Harlin
Okay. Let's start with the ﬁrst part of your question on the UK. First of all, we don't take
scale (13:14) and that's very important in the business. If I take the two examples, Isle of
Man that means Isle of Man (13:23), it was €9.4 billion AUM. Take Elevate, Elevate is €10
billion.

Bloomberg Transcript

Second just have a look at – you have these ﬁgures of course, but just have a look at the
MD&A from last year and you will notice that in Life, in underlying earnings contribution
for sure was 75 (13:47) in Life. But a lot of this was corresponding to tax one-oﬀs.
Just have a look at the pre-tax, underlying earnings contribution. In 2015, it was €30
million (13:58). So you can understand that we were small on one side. Second we believe
that we have other opportunities to redeploy this €800 million of corresponding to the
disposal.
So it's a no-brainer. Again, it's a matter of scale. I truly believe we view (14:19) that in term
of products, Unit-Linked and so on, it was inline. But you know that the UK Life market is
extremely competitive and in other countries we can do Unit-Linked business at much
bigger scale and with much bigger proﬁtability. On the second part of your questions
was...

Q - Paul De'Ath
(14:43)

A - Gérald Harlin
Yes as a cooperative arc in (14:45) – ﬁrst of all they are in Unit-Linked business. If your
question is where is it in the net inﬂows, in the net inﬂows it was a regular premium which
means that it's only part of the total APE impact that ﬂows through the net inﬂows for the
ﬁrst quarter.

Q - Paul De'Ath
Okay, it was more a question of whether or not that business was also part of the UK Life
businesses that you sold, if it's part of the transaction (15:19).

A - Gérald Harlin

FINAL

Yes, it is part of the transaction. I'm sorry, the sign was obvious (15:25) for me. I'm sorry.

Q - Paul De'Ath
Okay, great. Thanks.

Operator
We have another question from Nick Holmes from Société Générale. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 21515144 <GO>}

Hi, Gérald. Thank you very much. Couple of questions, ﬁrst is any comment on the Turkish
repricing policy. I'm wondering whether you're conﬁdent that you're getting the situation
under control.

Bloomberg Transcript

Second, any comments on the situation in Hong Kong and I'm thinking here of the sale of
G/A products to replace the Unit-Linked, could you update us how that is going? Thanks
very much.

A - Gérald Harlin
Okay. As far as the Turkey situation is concerned, yes, you remember that following the
reinforcement of reserves that we did last year. We decided at the same time to
signiﬁcantly increase more than double the price of NPPL (16:22). That's what we did. And
so that's perfectly in line with what we could expect.
The second point is maybe you noticed that there will be an evolution in the legislation in
Turkey relative to NPPL (16:40) and we are just studying it and it might be I would say an
improvement going forward. You know that the real problem over there is that due to this
– due to the bodily injury in the mitigation (16:58) which are extremely high. This led to
very high price increase and the government trying to ﬁght and to ﬁnd solution more than
ﬁnd – ﬁnd (17:10) solution in order to stop this price increase. So it could be a good
evolution. We will really (17:16) discuss it in later on in the year. And I will update you on
this but I could say so far so good.
About the Hong Kong yes you noticed that in Hong Kong we increased signiﬁcantly the
APE due to this – due to the to the fact that we had a change in the legislation and
progressively we are increasing the Life business the traditional G/A business. But it's
what we call – I could call capital light and at the same time as we can see here we have an
NBV margin which is – which is quite good.

Page 6 of 19



Company Name: AXA SA
Company Ticker: CS FP Equity
Date: 2016-05-04

FINAL

So yes, we are progressing but we still – we are not there. That means that we have to
compensate the Unit-Linked business which means that in Hong Kong we still have a 17%
drop in APEs. And we are expecting to recover over time and at the same time you can
notice (18:21) that our NBV margin is still pretty high at 53%. So, it's not a matter of worry
but we have to ramp up our new generation of products. That's presently what we are
doing.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 21515144 <GO>}

Thanks. Just a very quick follow-up so would you say that in Hong Kong you do want to
grow a signiﬁcantly the G/A Savings business? I mean that is your strategy rather than just
say, be in Protection because you're very strong in Protection aren't you?

A - Gérald Harlin
Yeah exactly but the Savings part you know ﬁrst of all it's not pure Savings products. It's
products with some Protection in it. Second, it's capital light. To be clear, the way we are –
the way we are designing these products makes that you don't have – you have almost no
guarantee. You don't have a yearly guarantee. We have a lot of surrender feel (19:15) in
the ﬁrst years which means that in case there would be a surrender then we don't have an
LM raise (19:21) because we would be indemniﬁed through this surrender premium. So
the way we design these products makes that it's easy (19:28) and clearly the generation
of capital light products.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 21515144 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Thank you very much.

Operator
We have another question from James Shuck from UBS. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I have two questions please. Once again
just on Hong Kong, I'm just interested here about your sales into Mainland China.
Obviously you're rebasing down the level of sales following the changes on the UnitLinked but most of the companies that I look at I think they gear (20:02) increases from
sales into Mainland China and I'm just wondering why we're not seeing that with you
whether that is actually part of your plan or whether that's something you just decided not
to sell.
Secondly in more general terms, could you just kind of outline where you are in terms of
new product designs in Europe in particular and how they're adapting to the low bond
yield environment, low-return environment. I am particularly interested in the new
generation products. You talked about something in Japan in terms of new generation
Savings products there. But I'm interested in Europe in terms of kind of fee structures,
commissions, surrenders and whether Q1 is the start of something that's going to evolve
over the coming years or whether you're already where you need to be in terms of those
new product designs. Thank you.

FINAL

A - Gérald Harlin
Okay. Sales in Mainland China, no, we roughly we have 50% of our sales coming from
Mainland China in Hong Kong. What I explained before were the drop compared with
beginning of last year in Unit-Linked products. It's true for both the Mainland Chinese and
the Hong Kong customers. So that's it. But we didn't have any decline and I believe that
the comments made by the other competitors its true for us. So that means that we didn't
have any decline of the Mainland Chinese due to the change in the regulation of cash
payments – of payments.
Second, the new product design. You mentioned Japan, indeed in Japan what we did is
that we – initially you remember that we were selling VA products that VA products had
improved (21:51) margin. On top of this, it was – it created some volatility as you know due
to the hedging in line with our policy to hedge VA products.
And we decided to sell another style of the Savings product which is an Australian dollar
denominated product and with quite high margin. So that's an example and of Savings
products where the proﬁtability (22:20) is pretty high on top of my head, we should be
close to 40% in terms of proﬁtability.

Bloomberg Transcript

The second part of your question was about Europe. Yes, in Europe we are obviously
working on – we don't give up selling Unit-Linked products. I should tell you that although
we had some decline in the Savings product due to the turbulence on the market in
France in the ﬁrst two months.
Nevertheless we are still selling 41% of Unit-Linked products in our Savings products. So
that's quite good. That means that we don't give up. It's not because we – the markets are
diﬃcult that we give up on the percentage of Unit-Linked business, point number one.
Point number two, we are working on more attractive General Account products. You all
heard about Euro Croissance (23:15) and we have good news because Euro Croissance
(23:18) is a product that should be or should beneﬁt, it's not completely done yet but
should beneﬁt from part of the capital gains from the General Account portfolio. And the
way Euro Croissance (23:33) will work is that you don't – you won't have a yearly
guarantee, but a guarantee after ages (23:39) which means (23:40) that it will be clearly a
capital light type of products.
We are doing the same in other countries. Take Germany, in Germany we have (23:49)
products which are products with General Account and with Unit-Linked but again it's a
capital light type of products. And we have the same in Hong Kong. I just described we
have the same in Hong Kong I just described it. And almost everywhere you can expect
that we will develop General Account products but anyway with capital light type of
structure, but anyway there is no mystery in the present interest rate environment. We
cannot expect to make very attractive products so it should be analyzed as a complement
to Unit-Linked products.
Last but not least in some countries as well, we can develop some structured products
with guarantees which are not at 100% but at 80%, 85%. Why? Because in such a low
Page 8 of 19



Company Name: AXA SA

interest rate environment it could prove to be attractive to propose to our client a
structured product which is a Unit-Linked product with a guarantee which is below 100%.

We have another question from Farooq Hanif from Citigroup. Please go ahead.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi there I was wondering if you could comment on implications for AXA investment
management (25:12) in the UK from Elevate and then also the sale of the other UK Life &
Savings business. What proportion of the assets are managed and what could be at risk?

Bloomberg Transcript

Secondly, returning to Property & Casualty following up slightly on Nick's question, is
Turkey going to be going back to underwriting proﬁt? And generally speaking when you
look at the price increases that you're putting through particularly in personal lines, it
seems to me to be towards the upper end of the range of claims inﬂation. Will we see an
improvement in underlying loss ratios there particularly in the direct area where you're
obviously looking for scale but roughly hasn't been growing (26:01)? So if you could just
comment on proﬁtability in P&C given your activity (26:05)? Thank you.

A - Gérald Harlin
Okay. First of all on AXA IM I would say that a lot after our (26:10) business was open
architecture and it was done mostly through Architas and you know that we keep Architas
today. Architas it should be €20 billion roughly. And Architas is kept within our group
(26:26) because it's a – it's not a tool only for our UK business but it's a tool also for the
other European companies to sell Unit-Linked business especially for high net worth
(26:39) individuals where open architecture is key.
On the second part of your question is on the Casualty business. So it's a – I would say
that if your question is about the loss ratio, it's a bit early to give you any indication,
Farooq. I would say that for the time being what I can say that the weather conditions are
quite fair and good. But beyond I cannot go, and let's wait until end of June in order to
comment on this.
I can say, that even you were mentioning direct, yes in direct we are at plus 7%. It doesn't
mean (27:27) – so it's quite a success. You know that in direct we are beneﬁting for
example from the (27:35) in France where we had much more surrenders which means we
beneﬁt from this situation. It's a negative part of France (27:41). It's a positive for direct but
we don't give up on our traditional rules of proﬁtability, so that's for sure.

We have another question Jon Hocking from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir.

FINAL

Q - Jon M. Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone. Just to clarify – are you – just want to make sure that you're
committed to the group Pensions business in the UK. That hasn't changed as a result of
any of these transactions?

A - Gérald Harlin
No, that means – no that's quite clear that the group Pension, the group Pension business
is something that we won't – we won't run any more Life business in the UK, let's be clear.
And it's except the asset management part of Architas that I've just described before. So
that means that all the Life business – is will be sold. We already announced the disposal
of ﬁrst Isle of Man which is indeed the oﬀshore investment bond business €10 billion of
AUM (28:58) – €9.4 billion AUM. Second this morning we announced the disposal of
Elevate which is a wrap platform and its €10 billion of asset under management.

Bloomberg Transcript

The last part which is not sold yet but with our intention to sell is SunLife business and
SunLife business is protection business. And we have also the traditional investment and
pension business what we call Embassy (29:31) which will be sold as well. So that means
that in the end, with these three transactions out of which two have been announced yet,
we will get rid of all our Life business in the UK except the asset management because
we'll keep Architas.

Q - Jon M. Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

Okay. So you have P&C, so you have the Health business, you have Architas, you have
asset management and you have a – you still have a corporate pension platform there
yeah? Or not so (30:03)?

A - Gérald Harlin
No, no, no, no, no because Elevate, because Elevate and the traditional investment and
pension business will be sold. So no, no that's quite clear. We will keep P&C, you are
right. We will keep asset management, PPP but we won't have any more Life business.

We have another question from Stewart Blair from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please
go ahead, sir.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

FINAL

Good morning, good morning. I've got three questions. I think the ﬁrst one, can you
comment, Gérald on the ongoing P&L eﬀects of the UK disposals? That would be useful.
And secondly, can you talk – you've talked about 3.4% price increases in P&C, what would
be the price increase if we exclude the impact of the Turkish price change?
And thirdly, you've announced that you expect to raise €800 million from the UK
disposals you raised I think €1 billion or so from the U.S. real estate disposal. That's quite a
lot of money, what do you intend to do with those proceeds?

A - Gérald Harlin

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. So ﬁrst of all, relative to your ﬁrst question on the P&L eﬀect, so its – I said that and
we announced this morning that we could expect to have a €400 million net income
impact, so it's a book value. We had a book value which was higher so we take a lot
selling at €800 million. So the book value was roughly at €1.2 billion.
I wanted to tell you at the same time that you should keep in mind that we have a
signiﬁcant – we should have a signiﬁcant capital gain from the disposal of the two building
as I said in my introduction. So that means that anyway we believe ﬁrst that it was a good
decision taking into account as I said before the book proﬁtability of this business, our
books scale. And second yes there will be an impact in term of P&L but this impact will be
more than oﬀset by other operations.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Gérald, the question was what is the ongoing impact on the P&L from selling these
businesses, the ongoing eﬀect?

A - Gérald Harlin
The ongoing eﬀect, I think that we can expect there will be relatively – there will be
relatively few impacts I would say there will be some trending (33:08) costs that will
remain. But very quickly we'll take the right measures in order to oﬀset them. So, don't
expect signiﬁcant negative impacts on the P&C business. I see your question but you can
imagine at the same time that we'll take the right decision in order to oﬀset it.
We have a nice business in the UK. Our P&C business and PPP in Health is doing
extremely well. We have a strong growth so that means that this strong growth makes that
we will absorb it and very quickly. And I don't have any speciﬁc fear on that side.
On the second question which is the price increase, you can go to the press release and
you will notice that in P&C that on page six that you have a price increase in mature

FINAL

markets which is 1.3%, high growth markets which is 15.2%. I don't have the exact ﬁgures
but I can expect that most of the (34:29) is coming from Turkey, so it's by far the main
impact.
I just wanted to tell you that we have a 9% growth in revenues. We said that excluding
Turkey, we would have been at 4%. But it would have been more 5% because as you know
we have some companies which are accounted under the equity methods. If we take this
into consideration and for example with China (35:05) then we would be more towards
5% to 6%, so it's something that needs to be kept in mind.
Your last question is about the cash, so that means that the cash of this, we will roughly
speaking we will upstream, I believe nothing is decided yet. Out of the €800 million, we
might upstream €400 million maybe from the UK the rest staying locally because we will
have some needs for the pensions fund and so on and protecting (35:43) the organic
growth.

Bloomberg Transcript

So that it. Yes, we will – this year we can expect to have a good level of cash that will be
upstreamed to the holding company. But nothing will change. That means that we will
keep the same policy meaning that we will – that will be a way for us to fund our – you
remember also at the last, you remember at that was in December that I mentioned that
we could slightly decrease the Tier 1 debt because it was not eﬃcient.
So it could be a way for us to marginally decrease also our Tier 1 debt which is not part of
it – which is not so eﬃcient. So that's it. But I believe that we will have also the
opportunities as usual to develop our business through organic growth and external
growth.
As we said, we took the example of €1 billion of acquisitions (36:57), so that's something
that on average over the next years is something that you could keep in mind. But it's not
– it's not our intention. At the same time, you know that our solvency is at 200%. It's a
good level and it's just within our range so no intention for us to go to the top up to 30
(37:18).

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

And what about the proceeds from the U.S. disposal Gérald, how much of that will you
upstream?

A - Gérald Harlin
Well we will upstream – we should upstream – I said that usually we have €600 million
coming from the U.S. You remember I'm sure this ﬁgure. So we could have this year a bit
more that means that it could be €700 million, €800 million more coming from the U.S.
But there are plus and minuses at the book level.
So that's – it's a bit early to tell you okay. What will it mean (37:52) because it's your – it's
your question. What will it mean, how will it translate into your payout ratio – your
remittance ratio.

So the remittance ratio should be – last year we were in the high-end. So we can expect
due to this to be in the high-end. But it's too early to give you a more precise answer
relative to this.

We have another question from Niccolò Dalla Palma from Exane BNP Paribas. Please go
ahead, sir.

Q - Niccolò Dalla Palma
Yes, good morning. I just wanted to check on the disposal of the two real estate
properties in the U.S. was this gain – did this gain impact solvency at all or were the
buildings already mark-to-market in your Solvency II calculation?

A - Gérald Harlin
They are already in solvency – they are already mark-to-market, point number one. Point
number two it's in the U.S. so it's a whole by the equivalence (38:50).

Q - Niccolò Dalla Palma

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. So it's completely neutral.

A - Gérald Harlin
Don't expect – this will have a cash impact as explained by Blair. This will have a net
income impact but no Solvency II impact.

Q - Niccolò Dalla Palma
Okay. Very clear. Thank you.

Operator
And we have another question from Michael Huttner from JPMorgan. Please go ahead,
sir.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 21417183 <GO>}

This is very boring (39:12). Can you – just walk us through the solvency from 200% – from
205% to 200%, so the – between how much the bond contributed, the operating proﬁt
and the stresses (39:27) from markets. That would be very helpful.
And then just to be clear, so from what I understand from the previous points you
explained on the U.S. and UK, the beneﬁt to solvency will then – is there only (39:41) the
Page 13 of 19

UK disposals? Can you give us a ﬁgure maybe? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Gérald Harlin
Okay. As far as your ﬁrst question is concerned, so we were starting from 205%. So we
have the normal impact of the underlying growth and proﬁt and which means that let's
say it's always between 204% and 205% (40:08). So it's absolutely in line with our
sensitivities. Keep in mind that at the same times that we were at 190% and we were not at
190% I gave you the indications that at the end of February on the 25 of February (40:22)
that we were at 190%.
So that means that we if I try to explain what happened in March, ﬁrst of all we had a bit
more of operating proﬁt maybe 1 to 2 points. We increase by 5 points the solvency due to
the €1.5 billion of subordinated debt increase. Hence at the same time we have the
dividend and so and we have a market impact that was a bit more or less benign starting
from the 205%, to be more clear. That means that 205% operating proﬁt plus 5% sub debt
that we issued plus 5% dividend minus 2% and the market eﬀect minus 8% (41:18) then
you have 200% (41:19). That's roughly the goal (41:20) forward.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 21417183 <GO>}

That's really good. Thank you.

A - Gérald Harlin

Bloomberg Transcript

The second – I missed the second part of your question.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 21417183 <GO>}

Just the UK deals, how much do they add to solvency?

A - Gérald Harlin
1 point.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

1 point (41:33).

A - Gérald Harlin
1 point.

And we have another question from Andrew Crean from Autonomous. Please go ahead,
sir.

FINAL

Q - Andrew J. Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Good morning, all. I just have (41:49) two questions if I can. Firstly on Japan represents
about one-ﬁfth of the overall new business proﬁts and the margins there are about 3.5
times the average margin to over 100%. Can you just talk a little bit in the medium term
about whether those very high margins are sustainable?
And then secondly on European Life, I know on the G/A Savings you've taken out the
guarantees but with interest rates at current levels, oﬀering a return premium promise is
actually quite generous when you think about the expenses, the capital charges and the
default risk charges. Could you talk a little bit about whether the economics of that kind of
return of premium promise on G/A Savings?

A - Gérald Harlin

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. As far as Japan is concerned Andrew, so yes Japan is consistently being a country
where we have a high proﬁtability. Take into consideration also that the NBV margin is not
the IRR. In other words, keep in mind that the extremely low level of interest rates makes
(43:06) the NBV margin is pretty high, presently we are at 100%, 101%. In terms of IRR
which is excellent, we should be at the 15% on top of my head, which is good, when rates
are at zero. Well, our success is due to the fact that 70% of our business is Protection and
Health and also some Protection with Savings business. The pure Savings part we – I
described it before it's one-third, so it's relatively small.
Second keep in mind that although we have 2.5% market share only, it's captive – we have
captive clients through the CCI. And in each CCI in Japan we have operators in from AXA
which makes that it's an excellent network through the SME business and where we can
approach the owners of these SMEs and also the employees. So that's what makes our
business extremely proﬁtable and we don't expect, in the foreseeable future, a decline in
the proﬁtability.
The second part of your question was about the General Account products and how do
we do in order to have an attractive return. So that's again the last – take the example of
all the countries – or countries like AXA France. Last year we paid – we paid something
which was close to 2.5% (44:50). So we can expect that this is extremely attractive in the
present environment.
We didn't at all reduce our margin this year and in the foreseeable future we don't expect
to reduce our own margin. But the fact that we have been managing eight years duration
helps us.
At the same time, we are extremely cautious not to dilute this – these – the margins. So on
an – take the new business is invested these days roughly around 2% to 2.2% (45:29) on
average. And we have an inforce (45:34) which is roughly at 3.5% (45:36). So all combined
makes that you can still propose to our client a guarantee even for new products which is
Page 15 of 19



Company Name: AXA SA
Company Ticker: CS FP Equity
Date: 2016-05-04

positive, which is let's say even between 1% and 2% (45:51) and still being attractive. And it
will help us sell more Unit-Linked business. That's our strategy. That's what we want to do.

FINAL

Q - Andrew J. Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Gérald, can I just follow-up on that. If you're – on new business if you're investing at 2.2%
you have expenses, you have to put capital up against credit defaults and if you're
oﬀering sort of what you're saying crediting rates of 1% to 2%, I can't see how the
economics work for the shareholder?

A - Gérald Harlin
Well, but, let's put (46:19) – ﬁrst of all, there is no defaults. That means that when you
invest in BBB the default is extremely, extremely low. And its – these days it's 0%. At the
same time keep in mind that you have no guarantees. That means that there is no product
that we sell today with any type of guarantee. On average we have a 90 basis – on
average we have a – on top of my head, 90 basis points margin on such type of products.

Bloomberg Transcript

So let's say just below 100 basis points. And you still even at 2.1% you have – if you keep
0.9% for you, you still have the capacity to pay 1% to the clients. So it's not really a big
issue and this doesn't take into account the fact that you have inforce business with
people going out. And you have a big U.S. cash ﬂow, positive cash ﬂow coming from the
inforce book of business.
I hope I'm clear, but no, it's not something which – of course if we would invest, if rates
would go further down, it would be diﬀerent. But in the present environment, I'm not so
worried about keeping a high level of proﬁtability on traditional business in G/A.

Q - Andrew J. Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

But you presumably do reserve against corporate bond defaults in BBB, don't you? Even if
you currently have no default rates (47:55).

A - Gérald Harlin
First of all we are not ruled (47:58) by IFRS 9 new rules. And second I can tell you, but I
could go when we'll have time together I could go into more detail. But I can – you can
trust me the defaults is extremely low. As I explained on at the end of February, we – in
order to avoid such type of default we have strict guidelines. We don't invest in BBB- or
we spread scarcity (48:26). Second, we limit the duration when investing in BBB- or in BBB
so we have a team which is really working on – that's what we call the Group Credit Team
in my own team, which is giving guidelines to the investment managers which are AXA IM
and AB in order to signiﬁcantly limit this type of issue.

Okay. Thank you.

your question.

FINAL

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Hi. Sorry guys. It's a Ralph Hebgen from KBW. Just one thing, Gérald, you mentioned that
you will be able to conduct Unit-Linked business both in higher volume and also in higher
proﬁtability outside the UK. Would you be able to comment on what the focus is in your
group? Which are these markets where you're hoping to focus your activities in UnitLinked? Thank you.

A - Gérald Harlin
You know the big Unit-Linked markets for us. They are the U.S., France and that's already a
signiﬁcant part of it. And of course Asia, Asia with countries like Indonesia for example.

Bloomberg Transcript

So what we do is that we – I can give you, Ralph, an example. These days, since the
beginning of the year, we have been quite successful in selling in France non-equities
(50:27) and the reason why we had been relatively successful, it's because we sold some
real estate type of Unit-Linked products. And these type of products is quite successful
because it's relatively good return. So the point is to adapt yourself to the present needs
and to avoid and to have a balanced portfolio which means that our clients don't suﬀer
too much from volatility. That's what we try to do, and it's working quite well.
You know that AXA Investment Managers is extremely successful in real estate. AXA IM –
Real Assets, that its name, is the number one in Europe and so meaning that we are quite
successful with a very strong team and with excellent performance. So we try to balance
these businesses.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Thank you very much.

A - Gérald Harlin
These Unit-Linked exposures.

Operator
We have another question from Stewart Blair from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. (51:38).

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thanks. Just one follow-up, Gérald. Just coming back to the Chinese product that you sell
in Q1. Can you give us just a little bit more detail on what that product looks like, what's
the guarantee, what's the expected – the duration (51:53), the ALM et cetera? Thank you.

A - Gérald Harlin

Page 17 of 19



Company Name: AXA SA
Company Ticker: CS FP Equity

FINAL

Okay, so it's traditional short-term products. So that means that it's a products with an
expected duration between one and ﬁve years so that's mostly it. And but again we try to
limit it. And it's not ideal from an ALM point of view to be clear. And that's the reason why
we limit this type of products and we for the rest its maybe – it will represent maybe oneﬁfth of the global production of the year. And for the rest it will be much more traditional
products with some Protection in it and so on and so forth. So that's it.
You can imagine that we are – I mentioned that we have an NBV margin. This NBV margin
is negative because there are some option – option to lapse for example from the clients
and – but the other products have much more attractive terms for us in terms of income or
proﬁtability as I've said. Just another point in terms of earnings we don't expect NBV
margin is negative, but we on – I would say not on a market consistent basis but in the real
world, these products are not loss making. That's an important point.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay. So you're able to make a positive spread in the real world.

A - Gérald Harlin

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah but I would not say that it's a great spread. I don't want to – no, no, but I want to be
clear, Blair. But nevertheless it's a positive spread and we will make money on the other
type of products. That's it and that's what is important.
Last element that I wanted to mention but is that there have been (54:01) a change in the
regulation in China which means that for the time being, these type of products are more
or less stopped in China. Because the regulator with the new capital rules especially
(54:18) will reinforce the level of capital that will be sold with this type of products. So we
can expect that it will bring a bit more discipline within the market and that in the end
we'll beneﬁt from it.
But again, it's not something which is unexpected in our development in China. I take the
opportunity, I'm sorry of – to go back to Michael's (54:46) questions, that means that I was
not exactly right I believe in (54:51) on the evolution of Solvency II. So we started from
205%, operational is 5% debt – sub debt is plus 5%, but the market is minus 13% and
dividend is minus 2%. I was wrong I said that the market was minus 8%, I'm sorry for that.

Q - Blair Stewart
