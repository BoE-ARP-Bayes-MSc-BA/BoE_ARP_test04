Eric P. Salsberg

{BIO 1552007 <GO>}

Yeah. Good morning, and welcome to our call to discuss Fairfax's 2014 year-end results.
This call may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ, perhaps
materially, from those contained in such forward-looking statements as a result of a
variety of uncertainties and risk factors, the most foreseeable which are set out under Risk
Factors in our Base Shelf Prospectus, which has been filed with Canadian securities
regulators and is available on SEDAR.
I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Prem Watsa.

FINAL

Thank you, Eric. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Fairfax's fourth quarter
conference call. I plan to give you some of the highlights and then pass it, as always, to
Dave Bonham, our CFO, for additional financial details.
Our results in 2014 were the best in our 29-year history, with record underwriting profits of
$552 million and record net earnings of $1.63 billion. We had a record combined ratio of
90.8%, with OdysseyRe 84.7% and all our major insurance companies having combined
ratios less than 100%. We also had net investment gains of $1.74 billion in 2014, including
realized gains $791 million. We're maintaining our defensive equity hedges and deflation
protection as we remain concerned about the financial markets and the economic outlook
in this global deflationary environment.
Our insurance and reinsurance businesses premium volume remain flat in 2014. The
combined ratio for our insurance and reinsurance operations in 2014 was 86.3% for the
fourth quarter; and as I said earlier, record 90.8% for the whole year. We made a record
underwriting profit of $552 million in 2014.

Bloomberg Transcript

At the subsidiary level, the increase in net premiums written in 2014 compared to 2013
and combined ratios were as follows: OdysseyRe up 0.7% in 2014 in terms of premium, a
combined ratio of 84.7%; Crum & Forster, premiums up 9.2%, combined ratio 99.8%;
Northbridge, in Canadian dollars up 0.6% with a 95.5% combined ratio; Zenith up 2.9%
with an 87.5% combined ratio; Fairfax Asia, 8.8% up in net premiums written, 86.7%
combined ratio.
The insurance and reinsurance operations produced operating income, excluding net
gains or losses on investments, of $915.4 million compared to $770.2 million in 2013,
primarily as a result of improved underwriting profit and higher interest and dividend
income.
As shown on page two of our press release, we have realized gains on our investment
portfolio of $790.6 million during 2014. Now excluding all hedging losses and before markto-market fluctuations in our investment portfolio, we earned $1.4 billion in pre-tax income.
If you include all hedging losses and mark-to-market fluctuations in our investment
portfolio, we reported a pre-tax income of $2.3 billion and after-tax income of $1.7 billion in
2014.
In 2014, you will note the investment portfolios went up to $26.2 billion from $24.9 billion at
the end of last year, in spite of being hedged 25% in cash and short-term investments
throughout the year and having little exposure to corporate bonds. So how did this
happen? Long U.S. government bond rates continue to drop and our common stocks did
much better than the Russell index, which increased 3.5% in the year.
We have yet to significantly benefit from our hedges and are approximately $112 billion
notional amount of deflation swaps. And, of course, our cash position gives us great
optionality. At our last annual meeting, we made the point that while we were protecting
our capital on the downside, our investment portfolios could also do very well. 2014 was a
case in point. Our common stock portfolios continue to be hedged at approximately 90%.

FINAL

We've selectively bought more stocks during the year, but we did not add to our index
hedges. Our common stocks outperformed that index, as I mentioned to you.
On the investment side, net investment gains of $1.7 billion in 2014 consisted of the
following. Please refer to page two of our press release. Net gains on equity and equityrelated investments after equity hedges of $347.4 million, resulting from net gains of
$541.9 million in our equity and equity-related investments, partially offset by $194.5 million
net loss in our equity hedges, reflecting the 3.5% increase in the Russell index.
We realized gains of $596.9 million in our equity and equity-related holdings in 2014. Also,
at the end of 2014, we had unrealized gains of $1.1 billion in our municipal and treasury
bond portfolio, which basically reversed the unrealized losses of 2013.
As we've mentioned in our annual meetings, annual reports and quarterly reports, with
IFRS accounting where starts and bonds are recorded at market and subject to mark-tomarket gains and losses, quarterly and annual income will fluctuate widely and investment
results will only make sense over the long-term.

Bloomberg Transcript

Core inflation continues to be at or below 1% in the United States and Europe; levels that
we've not seen since the 1950s. In fact, it may be a surprise to many of you to know that
in the second half of 2014, the U.S. had deflation of 1.5% or an annualized rate of 3%; and
Europe had deflation of 0.5% on an annualized rate of 1%.
What this is saying is that prices went down in the second half of 2014 at an annualized
rate of 3% in the United States and 1% in Europe. This is in spite of QE1, QE2, QE3, and
now quantitatively easing in Europe.
Long-term government bond rates in Europe are making record lows, quite often the
lowest in 200 years. In Germany, almost half of the German government bond market is
yielding negative interest rates. Also, six countries or seven countries in Europe are
already experiencing deflation. 30-year German government bond rates are below 1%.
The spread between 30-year U.S. long-term rates and 30-year German government
bond rates is at a record, as German rates have fallen much faster than the United States.
Now our CPI-linked derivatives, deflation swaps as we call it, with a notional value of
approximately $112 billion doubled in market value in the fourth quarter. This was the first
significant increase in market value since we purchased these CPI-linked derivatives. With
deflation in the air, these contracts have come to life, but they continue to be very volatile.
The majority of these contracts are based on the underlying U.S. CPI index. About 52.5%
of those contracts are in the United States; or the European Union CPI index,
approximately 40% of the contracts.
Further information is available on page three of our press release, where we've included
our table on our deflation swaps. On average, they have approximately 7.5 years to run.
As I've said to you before, our CDS experience comes to mind.

FINAL

Just to keep a perspective, I'll remind you that it took five years in Japan before deflation
set in for the next 18 years. When you review our statements, also please note that when
we own more than 20% of a company, we equity account and; about 50% we
consolidate, so that mark-to-market gains in these companies are not reflected in our
results.
As you see on page 11 of our quarterly report, the fair value of our investment in
associates, it's approximately $2.1 billion with a carrying value of approximately $1.6 billion,
an unrealized gain of $453 million, which is not on our balance sheet.
Also, Ridley and Thomas Cook, which are consolidated in our financial statements, are
doing very well compared to our original purchase price. We purchased Ridley in 2008 at
approximately CAD 8.5 per share; and the stock is at CAD 30.75 per share, after
significant dividend payments of approximately CAD 2 a share in the last three years.

Bloomberg Transcript

We purchased Thomas Cook at INR 52 per share in 2012, and it is now trading at about
INR 200. We continue to be concerned about the prospects for the financial markets and
the economies of North America and Western Europe. That's accentuated, as we've said
many times before, by the potential significant weakness in China. We have said for some
time that we believe there continues to be a disconnect between the financial markets
and the underlying economic fundamentals.
As of December 31, 2014, we have $6.1 billion in cash and short-term investments in our
portfolio, which is 23% of our total investment portfolio, to take advantage of
opportunities that may come our way. As a result, in the short-term, our investment
income will likely be reduced.
On November 14, 2014 â€“ in November 2014 Fairfax completed its acquisition of Pethealth
for cash of approximately $89 million or CAD 100 million. Pethealth operates in the United
States, Canada and the United Kingdom under the leadership of Sean Smith and is North
America's second largest provider of medical insurance for dogs and cats.
In December 2014, Fairfax announced that it had agreed to acquire the Malaysian general
insurance business of MCIS Zurich Insurance through its wholly-owned subsidiary Pacific
Insurance. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2015. The business
generated approximately $55 million in gross premiums; and Gobi Athappan will lead the
combined business.
In December 2014, the company â€“ Fairfax entered into an agreement with QBE to acquire
their insurance operations in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia. The transaction is
expected to close by the third quarter of 2015. In its most recent fiscal year, QBE's
operations in these three countries generated over $40 million in gross premiums written
in the range of general insurance classes. Peter Csakvari, with 17 years at AIG in Eastern
Europe, is leading the business. We continue to be soundly financed with year-end cash
and marketable securities in the holding company of $1.2 billion. The company's total debt
to total capital ratio improved to 24.6% at the end of the year, compared to 26% at end
of the previous year.

Subsequent to year-end, Fairfax India Holdings Company completed $1 billion offering of
common shares, of which the company, Fairfax Financial, purchased all of the multiple
voting shares for $300 million constituting a controlling interest. We are very excited
about the opportunities in India under Prime Minister Modi; and we believe Fairfax India will
earn attractive returns for its shareholders including Fairfax.
Now I would like to turn it over to Dave Bonham, our CFO, so he can give you some more
information on the underlying financials. Dave?

David Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

Thank you, Prem. First, I'll focus on Fairfax's consolidated results for the fourth quarter of
2014, then move on to the operating company results, and finish with our consolidated
financial position.
For the fourth quarter of 2014, Fairfax has reported net earnings of $24 million or $0.49
per share on a fully diluted basis; and that compares with the fourth quarter of 2013, when
we reported a net loss of $6 million or $0.98 per fully diluted share.

Bloomberg Transcript

Year-to-date, Fairfax has reported net earnings of just over $1.6 billion or $73 per share on
a fully diluted basis. That reflects a significant improvement relative to 2013, when we
incurred a year-to-date net loss of $573 million; and that was $31 per fully diluted share.
Underwriting profit at our insurance and reinsurance operations in the fourth quarter and
full year of 2014 increased to $207 million and $552 million, with combined ratios of 86%
and 91%; and that's compared to underwriting profit of $165 million and $440 million last
year, when we had combined ratios of 89% and 93% in the fourth quarter and full year
respectively. On a year-to-date and a quarter-to-date basis, underwriting profit is up by
$112 million and $42 million respectively.
Our combined ratios benefited from net favorable prior-year reserve development in the
fourth quarter and full year of 2014 of $218 million and $446 million, translating into 14 and
7 combined ratio points; and that was similar to net favorable development of $212 million
and $440 million in the fourth quarter and full year of 2013, and that also represented 14
combined ratio points on the quarter, 7 on the year.
Current period catastrophe losses were lower in the fourth quarter of 2014 and totaled
$38 million or 2.5 combined ratio points; and were $189 million or 3.2 combined ratio
points for the full year. By way of comparison, cat losses in the fourth quarter and full year
of 2013 were higher at $71 million and $289 million, representing 4.7 and 4.8 combined
ratio points respectively.
Please note that during the fourth quarter of 2014, OdysseyRe changed the manner in
which it recognizes premiums from its U.S. multi-peril crop insurance business similar to
the adjustment that it made in Q2 earlier in this year. OdysseyRe recognized the majority
of the premium from the winter planting season in the fourth quarter of 2014, whereas in
2013 these premiums were recognized in the first quarter of the following year.

FINAL

After making the adjustments in 2013 and 2014 that we set out on page 48 of our fourth
quarter report, net premiums written by our insurance and reinsurance operations were
relatively unchanged in the fourth quarter of 2014; an increase by 1.1% in the full year.
Now turning to our operating company results, we'll start with OdysseyRe. In the fourth
quarter and full year of 2014, OdysseyRe reported underwriting profits of $142 million and
$360 million in combined ratios of 76% and 85%; and that was compared to underwriting
profits last year of $122 million in the quarter, $380 million year-to-date, where the
combined ratios were 79% and 84%.
Catastrophe losses in the fourth quarter and full year of 2014 totaled $33 million and $145
million; and that translated into 5.6 and 6.2 combined ratio points. The fourth quarter of
2014 included only attritional catastrophe losses, while Windstorm Ela was the largest
individual catastrophe loss at $38 million in the full year of 2014. That compares to
catastrophe losses of $65 million and $203 million last year, which translated into 11 and 9
combined ratio points on the combined ratio points in the fourth quarter and full year of
2013.

Bloomberg Transcript

OdysseyRe's combined ratios in 2014 in the quarter included the benefit of $108 million
and year-to-date $189 million of net favorable prior-year reserve development, principally
related to causality and non-catastrophe property loss reserves in the quarter and yearto-date; and the full year-to-date net favorable development also included the
development related to property cat loss reserves.
After adjusting for timing differences and the recognition of crop insurance premiums that
we mentioned earlier, OdysseyRe wrote $562 million and a little under $2.4 billion of net
premiums in the fourth quarter and full year of 2014 respectively. That reflects decreases
of 2.4% and 1.4% in those periods. And those decreases principally recognized declines in
the writings of reinsurance business primarily in property lines due to the competitive
market conditions now prevailing; and that was partially offset by growth across most lines
of business in the U.S. insurance division.
Turning to Crum & Forster, Crum & Forster reported an underwriting loss of $3 million and
a combined ratio of 100.9% in the fourth quarter of 2014; and an underwriting profit of $3
million and a combined ratio of 99.8% for the full year of 2014. That compared to
underwriting losses of $21 million and $24 million, and combined ratios of 107% and 102%
in the fourth quarter and full year of 2013.
While there is no net prior-year reserve development in 2014, Crum & Forster's combined
ratios in the fourth quarter â€“ while there was no net prior-year reserve development in
2014, Crum & Forster's combined ratios in the fourth quarter and full year of 2013
included $8 million of net unfavorable prior-year reserve development, representing 2.6
and 0.7 of the combined ratio points.
Current period catastrophe losses were modest at $1.5 million and $14 million in the fourth
quarter and full year of 2014 and added 0.4 and 1.1 points to the combined ratios during
those periods. 2013 catastrophe losses were not significant.

FINAL

Crum & Forster's net premiums written increased by 6% and 9% in the fourth quarter and
full year of 2014, primarily reflecting growth in the Fairmont accident and health business
and organic growth in the environmental casualty business, partially offset by planned
reductions in the legacy CoverX business. The full year of 2014 also reflected the
contribution to the environmental casualty business of American Safety and growth at
Seneca.
Turning to Zenith, Zenith reported underwriting profits in the fourth quarter and full year
of 2014 of $26 million and $90 million with corresponding combined ratios of 86% and
88%; and that compared to underwriting profits of $22 million and $19 million and
combined ratios of 88% and 97% in the fourth quarter and full year of 2013.
The improvement in 2014 reflected the following: a year-over-year decrease in the fourth
quarter and full year of 2014. Estimated current accident year loss ratios of 2.9 percentage
points and 4.6 percentage points, and that was due to the favorable loss development
trends that are emerging on the 2013 accident year. There were also price increases that
were equal to estimated loss trends for accident year 2014. And, finally, net favorable
development of prior year's reserves in the full year of 2014, representing 10 combined
ratio points. It was an increase over 2013, and that reflected net favorable emergence on
the 2011, 2012, and 2013 accident years.

Bloomberg Transcript

Net premiums written by Zenith of $128 million and $721 million in the fourth quarter and
full year of 2014 increased by 1.3% and 2.9% year-over-year; and that principally reflected
premium rate increases.
Northbridge reported underwriting profits of $17 million and $43 million and combined
ratios of 93% and 96% for the fourth quarter and full year of 2014; and that compared to
underwriting profits of $24 million and $18 million and combined ratios of 90% and 98%
reported in those same periods in 2013. The decrease in Northbridge's underwriting
profit quarter-over-quarter principally reflected increased large losses in the fourth
quarter of 2014 in transportation and logistics, and personal auto lines.
Northbridge's underwriting results in the fourth quarter and full year of 2014 included the
benefit of net favorable prior-year reserve development across most accident years and
lines of business of $54 million and $110 million, representing 23 combined ratio points
and 12 combined ratio points in those periods. That compared to net favorable
development of $46 million and $154 million. It represented 19, 16 combined ratio points in
the fourth quarter and full year of 2013.
Current period catastrophe losses were lower in the fourth quarter and full year of 2014,
accounting for 0.2 and 0.9 of a combined ratio point during those respective periods.
Whereas the Alberta and Toronto floods in 2013 were principally responsible for adding
2.1 points and 6.2 points to the combined ratios in the fourth quarter and full year of 2013.
In Canadian dollar terms, net premiums written by Northbridge in the fourth quarter and
full year of 2014 increased by 6.5% and 4.4%, after excluding the one-time impact of the

Page 7 of 19



Company N ame: Fairfax Financial H oldings L td

Date: 2015-02-13

intercompany unearned premium portfolio transfer on January 1, 2013, between
Northbridge and Group Re that we describe on page 41 of our fourth quarter report.

FINAL

Increased writings principally reflected rate increases across most segments and
increased volume at Federated Insurance and in the western region of Northbridge
Insurance, and that was partially offset by the strategic non-renewal of an unprofitable
portfolio business in 2014.
Fairfax Asia reported improved underwriting profits of $10 million and $36 million and
combined ratios of 84% and 87% in the fourth quarter and full year of 2014, compared to
underwriting profits of $9 million and $32 million and combined ratios of 88% in each of
the comparable 2013 periods.
The combined ratios in the fourth quarter and full year of 2014 included 20 combined
ratio points and eight combined ratio points of net favorable prior-year reserve
development, primarily related to engineering, workers' compensation, property and
commercial automobile loss reserves.

Bloomberg Transcript

The insurance and reinsurance other segment produced underwriting profits of $15 million
and $21 million and combined ratios of 85% and 95% in the fourth quarter and full year of
2014, compared to underwriting profits of $10 million and $15 million and combined ratios
of 92% and 97% in those same periods in 2013. The improvement in underwriting profit in
the fourth quarter and full year of 2014 principally reflected increased net favorable prioryear reserve development, partially offset by lower non-catastrophe related underwriting
margins in the current accident year.
Net premiums written by the insurance and reinsurance other segment increased by 9% in
the fourth quarter of 2014, primarily reflecting increases at Advent related to writings of
new business in marine, property and accident and health insurance lines of business.
Net premiums written decreased by 7% in the full year of 2014, primarily reflecting
decreases at Polish Re and Advent, principally due to the non-renewal of certain classes
of business where terms and conditions were considered inadequate, and after the
adjustment to exclude the one-time impact of the intercompany unearned premium
portfolio transfer that we mentioned earlier; and that suppressed the gross premiums
written and net premiums written in Group Re in 2013 by $39 million.
Runoff reported operating losses of $22 million and $89 million in the fourth quarter and
full year of 2014. That compared to operating income of $91 million and $77 million in the
same periods in 2013. The decrease in the fourth quarter and full year operating
profitability at Runoff principally reflected net adverse prior-year reserve development at
U.S. Runoff and incremental operating expenses associated with American Safety, which
we had acquired in 2013.
In the fourth quarter of 2014, Runoff agreed to reinsure an Italian medical malpractice
runoff portfolio; and that added $67 million to net premiums earned and a corresponding
increase of $66 million to losses on claims.

FINAL

Looking at our consolidated results. Consolidated interest and dividend income increased
from $104 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 to $119 million in the fourth quarter of 2014,
reflecting a modest increase in interest income earned, partially offset by higher total
return swap expense.
Consolidated interest and dividend income increased from $377 million in the full year of
2013 to $404 million in the full year of 2014, reflecting an increase in interest income
earned and lower total return swap expense partially offset by lower dividends earned on
common stocks as a result of sales of dividend paying equities during 2013.
In 2014, the company recorded income tax provisions of $41 million at an effective tax rate
of 52% in the fourth quarter and $673 million at an effective tax rate of 29% in the full year.
Notable in the fourth quarter and full year of 2014 was a $38 million provision that
followed from an internal reorganization of the U.S. shareholders of OdysseyRe. That
added 48 points to the quarter-to-date effective tax rate and 1.6 points to the year-todate effective tax rate.

Bloomberg Transcript

The year-to-date effective tax rate was also increased by the impact of significant
investment gains and improved underwriting results in the U.S., where the statutory
income tax rate of 35% is significantly higher than the Canadian statutory income tax rate.
Those reconciling items, just mentioned, were offset quarter-to-date and year-to-date by
the impact of our regularly recurring adjustments for non-taxable investment income in
the U.S. and Canada, which lower our effective tax rate.
We ended the year with an investment portfolio, which included holding company cash
and investments, of $26.2 billion compared to $24.9 billion at the end of 2013. The
majority of the increase related to net appreciation of investments, principally bond and
common stock investments.
Moving to our financial position, our total debt to total capital ratio decreased to 24.6% at
December 31, 2014, from 26.1% last year December, primarily as a result of the increase in
our common shareholder's equity reflecting the net earnings for the year, partially offset
by the issuance on August 13, 2014, of $300 million principal amount of our senior notes
due 2024 for net proceeds of $294 million.
We used a portion of those proceeds from that offering in the fourth quarter to redeem
$50 million principal amount of OdysseyRe unsecured senior notes, and to redeem $25
million principal amount of American Safety trust preferred securities. And we intend to
use the remainder of that funding to repay upon maturity the Fairfax and OdysseyRe
unsecured notes coming due in 2015.
With that, I'll pass it back to you, Prem.

the call. So, Rebecca, we're ready for the questions.

Q&A

FINAL

Operator
Thank you. Our first question comes from Paul Holden with CIBC. You may ask your
question.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Hi, Paul.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask a couple of questions on the CPI-linked derivatives to
start. So the first one would be since we're so close at least in the U.S. to the weighted
average strike, is there any way you can give us the dispersion of strike prices so we get a
sense of how close you might be to the first sort of really relevant contract price? And
then the second question would be just to verify that indeed these are American style
options and not European; i.e., can exercise them at any time?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Yeah. So we can exercise them at any time. And the way to think of â€“ these things are very
volatile, as I said. So if you look at the TIP bonds, the inflation adjusted bonds, and you'll
see they fluctuate. Maybe a few years ago, the underlying inflation rate in a TIP bond, for
five-year TIP bonds, may have been 2% inflation, might have come right down to 1.1% early
in the year, now bounced back to about 1.3%. So it moves up and down. And that inflation
rate, underlying inflation rate, still inflation, not deflation, has an impact on the bond and â€“
on the deflation swaps rather.
And it's tradable, but American style in the sense that these are tradable bonds, tradable
deflation swaps that we can sell at any time in the marketplace. But, I guess, it's
exercisable at the end. Yeah. So just a correction there, Paul. European style in the sense
that they're exercisable in the end, but can trade in the marketplace at any time,
reflecting the fact that it's exercisable at the end.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Okay. Just as a suggestion, any kind of disclosure you could â€“ additional disclosure you
could provide us to give us a sense of significant trigger points on the CPI index levels
would be helpful. Averages are always helpful, but only as helpful as an average is?

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

First, Paul, the averages is not a bad way to look at it.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

And think of it like this, it's an option contract which is not in the money. So if you think of
those contracts, say, 1% off out of the money and you have 5% deflation, then the intrinsic
value is 4%. And then you'd build a premium because it's got a life, six years, seven years,
seven-and-a-half years on average to go.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Okay. I understand.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

And on top of that you just have the emotional element that comes in when people worry
about deflation.

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Your newest investment and vehicle, Fairfax India, a big part of the investment thesis
there was a favorable change in government, i.e., much more business-friendly
government; and that makes a lot of sense to me. On the flipside, I would argue that in
Greece, we've seen a change in government to a less business-friendly government.
Wondering if you agree with that opinion and if it changes your thesis on any of the
investments you've made in Greece?

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Yeah. So that's a very good point you make. There has been a change in the Greek
government. We've actually met them. And for what it's worth, they've reassured us that
they want private investment. They've emphasized that Eurobank is the only private bank,
in the sense that the other three banks, there's four banks now, the other three banks are
65% owned by the government, Eurobank is less than 35%. And so, they have said to us
that they like â€“ we asked them very specifically of what their views on private investment
were, and they said they want to encourage it. And so the bottom line, Paul, you never
know what will happen in these negotiations. Our view is that eventually a deal will be
done.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from Tom MacKinnon with BMO Capital. You may ask your
question.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Good morning, Tom.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question, Prem. Just a comment
about the cash position. It's still pretty heavy and you've had this heavy cash position over
the last several years when equity markets had moved up significantly. Trying to figure out
what is really the underlying reason for holding so much cash. As the insurance business
tends to slow a little bit, it's not like you really need to pump a lot of money into growing
that. We're getting certainly increased capacity here in global reinsurance markets, and
prices are starting to fall a little bit in commercial lines in North America. So it's not as if
there is a need to throw it into those operations to fund growth. And to what extent does
the cash settlement on the equity hedges have anything to do with your thinking to keep
a significant cash holding at this level?

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Tom, we've had significant amounts of cash over the years, long before we had hedges,
but the way we get the cash is a resultant. When we don't see opportunity -we're not
trying to meet some quarterly earnings estimate that you or others might have; and we're
looking at building our company over the long-term. So when we don't see opportunity
with significant downside protection, then we'd rather keep it in cash. And when we buy
something, as we bought things in Greece, it doesn't mean we're right. Sometimes we
think there's downside protection and it changes. But every time we buy a stock or a
bond, we're looking at protection on the downside. And right now our view is there's very
little protection on the downside.
Now if you were meeting quarterly estimates or yearly estimates, then you'd be reaching
for yield. You'd be buying corporate bonds or you'd be buying other things that would
give you income, so that you can meet these goals that you have. Our goal is increase
book value 15% a year over the long-term. So we don't respond to quarterly numbers.
And so that cash gives us tremendous optionality.
So, for example, in 2008, 2009, most people didn't buy stock. They're all buying stock
today and in the last few quarters. And you're exactly right, Tom. If we were smart, we'd
be fully invested in 2012 particularly, because 2013 was a terrific year, up 35%; and I hate
to say it, but we basically didn't benefit from that. But investing â€“ I've been in the business
for 40 years â€“ it's a long-term game. And if you measure yourself every three months and
six months or a year or two, you might do the wrong thing.

FINAL

And, for example, in 2007 and 2006, you might have thought we were totally wrong; and
of course things changed in 2008 and 2009 and some companies didn't make it in 2008,
2009. One of the biggest company in our industry was bankrupt and the U.S. government
had to come to back it. So we don't want to be ever in a position for that to happen. And
we think, as we've said for some time, that there's a lot of unintended consequences
here, Tom.
The price of oil dropping from $100 to $50; totally unexpected for most people. We've
said in our annual report last year that commodity prices could collapse, and we monitor
the prices and hadn't changed for two or three years. You can see $100 price of oil in our
annual report year-after-year; and then bang, it dropped to $50. Now if you didn't hedge
and you expanded significantly in the oil industry, like we see in many of the oil
companies, you may not survive. So we're very sensitive to that.
That price of oil coming down, by the way, we think is not only supply in the United States,
but it's reflecting a decreasing demand from China. And China is a big â€“ and we've talked
about for some time that China is a big potential negative. And you never know when it'll
strike, but you have to be careful about it.

Bloomberg Transcript

So when we look at all of these things Tom, we'd rather be safe than sorry. And we just
stay on the sidelines. We let other people reach for yield. But you can see, in spite of all
that, last year all-in, all-out, we had a very good return, significant realized gains, our
underwriting profitability was exceptional. And so, in spite of being very defensive and
watching the downside, we're making good returns.

Good morning, Mark.

Q - Mark A. Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Yeah. Good morning. Just a couple of questions. First, I was trying to follow on â€“ you had a
note in the interim report on the OdysseyRe organization and I was trying to follow along,
was there any net cash distributed from the holding company at the end. By the time all
the ins and outs were all settled was there any net cash distributed from that?

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Dave, you want to take that?

A - David Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah. It wasn't very significant; in the neighborhood of about $80 million or so from the
holding company cash.

Q - Mark A. Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Okay.

A - David Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

And what we did there, Mark, is simplify our corporate structure so that OdysseyRe was
basically owned by Fairfax holding company as opposed to being owned at Crum &
Forster or in our Runoff companies.

Q - Mark A. Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

It definitely seemed like it would streamline the org chart a little bit. The second question
that I had â€“ I mean congratulations on very significant amounts of favorable reserve
development in the quarter. What I was trying to determine is was there an impact from
currency in that amount? It seemed like some of the units, particularly the other reinsurers,
the European group and the Northbridge had, I'll say, relatively larger amounts than I
might have expected, and I was curious if currency was involved there?

A - David Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

No. Currency was not significant at all, Mark. Basically, we'd like to have that kind of
reserve redundancies. We're always keeping our accident year loss ratios at a good level,
so that we'll have reserve redundancies. But as you pointed out in the fourth quarter, we
had perhaps more than we expected. But our reserves â€“ there are two things that our
company is focused on, underwriting profitability all across the spectrum and reserve
redundancies every year. And I must say, as I look across all our companies the reserve
positions because at year-end are excellent and the prospects for our combined ratio are
good. But we've got catastrophes coming in at any time, and so you have to take all of
that into account. But at the moment things look good.

Q - Mark A. Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks for that. And one last question, if I may, on the OdysseyRe. Just wanted to
clarify, make sure I understood the table in the report. So it was $41 million of premium
that was recorded in the December quarter that all else equal had it been under the old
way you did it would have been otherwise recorded in January of 2015. Is that the right
way to think about it?

A - David Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

That's right. That's the impact on the fourth quarter. And then when you're comparing
year-over-year, you would make the same adjustment to the beginning of the years to
Page 14 of 19



Company N ame: Fairfax Financial H oldings L td
Company Ticker: FFH CN Equity
Date: 2015-02-13

adjust for the premium that needs to come out of the first quarter of 2015 (46:44).

Q - Mark A. Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

FINAL

Right. So when I'm thinking about my 1Q 2015 estimate, I would want to assume that I had
started out $40 million kind of in the hole as it were, and then build up my estimate from
there?

A - David Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

I think that's the way look at it. Yeah.

Q - Mark A. Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi, Prem.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Hey. Good morning, Howard.

A - David Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

Hi Howard.

Q - Howard Flinker
Nice results, or better than nice results. I have a few comments. One, as an insight into the
oil business, which was really helpful to me on the short side, is that PetroChina and
Sinopec in their quarterly or semi-annual statements break out marketing volumes, not
dollars; dollars too, but units. And you could see in the last year-and-a-half that their
growth in marketing volumes of oil and diesel and all that stuff were growing anywhere
between 1% and minus 4%. Two years ago, they were growing 10%, 11%. And the imports
were supposedly growing 7% or 8%. So the conclusion had to be they were stockpiling
and one day they would have too much. And they probably have cut back that extra, but it
doesn't look as if they're eating into that inventory yet. So it's possible they could reduce
demand even more. That's one point I'd like to make.

Good point, Howard.

Q - Howard Flinker

FINAL

Second, in 1922 oil traded at $2.40 a barrel in United States; in 1972 it was $3 (48:31). Oil
could go nowhere for a long time.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Yes. I remember looking at the history of the price of oil. Yeah, you're exactly right. Till
1974, I think, then...

Q - Howard Flinker
1973 or 1974, overnight they quadrupled â€“ and led to the bear market. And finally I'll pass
on something I heard yesterday because I went to a presentation at the Columbia B
School. This Japanese professor who among various educational stints was a consultant
to the Ministry of Finance or the Japanese investment funds, et cetera. And I wanted to
hear what he had to say about deflation. And in summary, they view the oil impact on the
deflationary statistics as purely numerical. They think that once the oil stabilizes, deflation
won't continue. And I didn't want to ask any questions, I didn't want to give him any clues
but â€“ I'm serious. But â€“ because I thought about this two years ago in relation to what
would happen in relation to the oil business, what would happen to deflationary statistics
if you had a minus in oil â€“ a big minus in oil?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Howard Flinker
And from what I'm reading and from what he said, they think well, it's just an oil problem.
You and I don't think so.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Howard Flinker
You and I think it's broader...

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Exactly right, Howard.

Q - Howard Flinker
Yeah. But it will give â€“ and then somebody asked will there be a QQE3, they call it QQE.
They've done QQE1 and QQE2. He said no, unless something comes wrong â€“ happens

wrongly. So that means that if our view, your view and mine, about deflation is on the
mark, they're going to be surprised; and not only them, but Kearney and Poulos.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

FINAL

And a few more people, Howard, that might be surprised, but...

Q - Howard Flinker
Yeah. To give you an insight as to how they're thinking and how you can capitalize further; I
just wanted to pass that on.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

No. Thank you very much, Howard. You're very kind and your observations are good,
particularly on the price of oil. The fact that, as you said, 1922 to 1974, 1973, 1974, that's a
long time.

Q - Howard Flinker
Yeah. That was a tough trade, 25% in 50 years. It's below my hurdle rate.

Hi, Prem. Thank you for the opportunity.

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Hi, Binoy.

Q - Binoy Jariwala

{BIO 15214317 <GO>}

Hi. Wanted to ask your thoughts on Fairfax India, I believe when we had acquired Thomas
Cook India, we said that Thomas Cook India would be the investment vehicle for Fairfax

Page 17 of 19



Company N ame: Fairfax Financial H oldings L td
Company Ticker: FFH CN Equity
Date: 2015-02-13

Financial's investments in India; and now that you've raised $1 billion, how should we look
at Thomas Cook, likewise how should we look at Fairfax India, your thoughts, please?

FINAL

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

Binoy, thank you for asking that question. That's a good question. Thomas Cook was our
investment vehicle for India, prior to Mr. Modi getting elected. We thought with the fact
that Mr. Modi got elected with a majority, business-friendly, track record in Gujarat, is a
game changer for India. We think it's going to be transformed over time, especially if he
gets â€“ we think he's going to get elected at least once and maybe twice. And as long as
his health is good, he'll continue for a long time and transform India.
So in that situation, Binoy, we had to think about whether we continue with the resources
we have or the opportunity could be so significant that we set up a different company. We
thought about it long and hard and we've decided to set up Fairfax India. And Fairfax India
with $1 billion, $300 million from us, has got a ton of possibilities in India over the longterm. We're very attracted to India.

Bloomberg Transcript

But as far as Thomas Cook is concerned, we see a significant opportunity for Thomas
Cook, particularly in their areas of operation. We see acquisitions, expansions. The type of
acquisitions that Fairfax India will do, Binoy, is sizeable ones, couple of hundred million,
which would be tough for Thomas Cook to finance. And ultimately we'd have to finance it
because we own 75% of it. But there'd be a lot of potential acquisitions in the fields that
Thomas Cook is in going forward.
We like the leadership of Madhavan Menon. We're very encouraged by his leadership for
what he has already done. We like Ajit Isaac of course from IKYA. And Ramesh
Ramanathan in Sterling Resorts. So there's a lot of opportunity in that company, and we
will continue to acquire companies in Thomas Cook. The Modi election changed things,
and that's why we created Fairfax India.

Q - Binoy Jariwala

{BIO 15214317 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. Thank you so much, Prem. Just a follow-up on this. Should we view
Thomas Cook India to grow in its domain and likewise Fairfax in the other domain? So, for
instance, if Thomas Cook is in travel, tourism, human resource, should we view Thomas
Cook as being restricted in these particular areas?

A - Vivian Prem Watsa

{BIO 16700363 <GO>}

I don't think you should view it as being restricted, but that's its area of expertise. And
we've kept it nice and broad, Binoy, so that both companies can flourish.

Q - Binoy Jariwala

{BIO 15214317 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you, Prem. That's it from my side.
