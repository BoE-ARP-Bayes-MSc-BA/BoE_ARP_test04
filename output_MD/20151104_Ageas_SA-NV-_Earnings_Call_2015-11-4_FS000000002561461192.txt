MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Ageas Nine Months 2015 Results Conference Call.
I am pleased to present Mr. Bart de Smet, Chief Executive Officer; and Mr. Christophe
Boizard, Chief Financial Officer. For the first part of this call, let me remind you that all
participants will remain on listen-only mode and afterwards, there will be a question-andanswer session. As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
I would now like to hand over to Mr. Bart de Smet and Mr. Christophe Boizard. Gentlemen,
please go ahead.

Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you all for dialing into this conference call
and for being with us for the presentation of the first nine months 2015 results of Ageas.
As usual, I'm joined in the room by my colleagues of the Executive Committee,
Christophe Boizard, the CFO; Filip Coremans, Chief Risk Officer; and by Antonio Cano, as
of October 1, our COO. Hans De Cuyper, the new CEO of AG Insurance, is also in the
room and, of course, we are joined by our Investor Relations team.
Ladies and gentlemen, financial markets have proven to be very volatile this year. And
after an outstanding first half, the third quarter faced growing concern about global

FINAL

economic prospects, especially in China, which resulted in a worst quarterly market
performance since 2011.
This forced us to book a net impairment on our equity portfolio in Europe and Asia for a
total amount of €62 million and this partly offset the excellent performance of the first
half. Since then, the market has very well recovered, which gives a better outlook for the
last quarter of the year. Overall, however, the financial performance remains strong and,
year-to-date, we are up compared to last year.
A strong operating performance in Non-Life of the first half has been confirmed in the
third quarter. We benefited from a favorable currency rate evolution, but at the same
time, we recorded a lower amount of net capital gains essentially because of the high
level of impairments on equity.
The main headlines announced today are on slide one of the presentation. Our net
Insurance profit for the first half (sic) [first nine months] (02:33) of € 613 million, which is an
increase of 6% compared to last year and the net result in the third quarter of €109
million. The latter was below annual expectations and this was why we decided to issue an
earlier results release to report on the impact of the equity impairments on our third
quarter results.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our operating performance remained solid for the group. Combined ratio year-to-date of
95.1%, in line with results at the end of June, while our Life Guaranteed operating margin
came down to 80 basis points mainly because of the lower amount of realized net capital
gains.
The unit-linked operating margin went up year-to-date to 37 basis points. The group
inflows, including the non-consolidated partnerships at 100%, were up 8% year-on-year in
the third quarter to €6.2 billion and to €22.8 billion year-to-date, which is an increase of
17%.
The group net result increased significantly year-on-year to €599 million, benefiting from
a positive result in the General Account in the third quarter as a result of reduced
valuation of the RPN(I) liability.
The shareholders' equity declined slightly compared to the end of June to €10.9 billion
with the lower level of unrealized gains on our investment portfolio at around €2.8 billion.
The Insurance solvency I ratio stood at 231%, while our net cash position including the
liquid assets amounted €1.7 billion.
So ladies and gentlemen, I would like now to give the floor to Christophe. I will come back
to you for the Q&A and some closing remarks.

Thank you, Bart, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. As usual, I will take first the
operating results by Insurance segment and then the General Account. So first, our
Insurance operations. As Bart already mentioned, I am on slide two of the presentation.
The net Insurance result in the third quarter amounted to €109 million compared to €239
million last year, so a decrease of €130 million. This gap can be explained by the €62
million impairment on equity this year. And as regard to last year, the realized capital gain
on real estate in Belgium for €59 million and the legal settlement of €17 million in the UK
related to the Retail business.
With respect to the breakdown of the equity impairments, roughly half of the amount
relates to the Asian activities, while the remainder is related to Belgium and, to a lesser
extent, to Continental Europe. The combined ratio for the third quarter amounted to
94.7%, almost exactly the performance of last year, while the operating margin on
Guaranteed business in Life fell from 96 basis points to 61 basis points this quarter,
because of the reasons already mentioned.

Bloomberg Transcript

Slide three, a key slide for this presentation. The slide three gives the year-to-date view
of the realized capital gains net of impairments. The difference of €131 million is largely
explained by the Q3 impairments and absence of real estate sale mentioned above. But
this is an interim position and we have very good hopes to catch up in Q4.
Some brief comments by segment now, first Belgium, I am on slide four. Our Belgium
operations reported a net profit year-to-date of €264 million compared to €321 million
last year. The higher levels of net equity impairments and lower levels of realized gains –
capital gains, which you can estimate at around €90 million; as for the real estate €59 plus
half of the €62 million. So roughly €90 million was mainly allocated to the Life activity, and
it significantly impacted the Life contribution. In addition, the Life activities benefited last
year from a deferred tax liability release of €21 million.
On Non-Life, I'd like to stress the continued excellent performance with a combined ratio
that remained strong at 94.2%, benefiting from a claims ratio 10% point lower than the
one of last year. Part of this relates to the prior years, but the current year claims ratio is
also substantially down.
In the UK, slide five, the net results year-to-date amounted to €65 million with a €7 million
positive FX contribution, compared to €80 million last year for the same period. (08:46)
last year including a €23 million legal settlement because this year (08:53) €23 million
relates to year-to-date figures whereas the €17 million I mentioned at the beginning of my
presentation was Q3 only. So we indeed received several payments in that respect.
The combined ratio of Ageas Insurance Limited improved to 98.3%, mainly because of a
good performance in Household; thanks to the absence of natural event until now.
The Motor performance remains challenging, marked by a higher claim frequency and
increased claim costs for Third Party damages, but at the same time, we see average
premiums starting to rise. The result of our Retail activities reported under Other and

Page 3 of 18

excluding the headquarter costs declined to €9 million. This amount includes the project
cost related to the renewed Retail strategy, which we are currently implementing.
In Continental Europe, slide six, the net result year-to-date amounted to €63 million,
compared to €43 million last year and with a substantial improvement in Non-Life. The
third quarter net result was marked by a negative Life contribution as a result of the
downward movement in the European equity market, while the Non-Life results remained
strong with an excellent combined ratio of 86% year-to-date.
The only negative element remains Turkey where the combined ratio remained above
100% at 103.5% due to bad weather and adverse Motor results. And I remember you
here – I remind you here that the Turkey is not consolidated. So the combined ratio of
86% does not include Turkey and the 103.5% is outside of the consolidated combined
ratio.

Bloomberg Transcript

And lastly, Asia, on slide seven of the presentation now, the net profit year-to-date of
€222 million, of which €19 million of income a positive FX contribution. The net result in the
third quarter is only €10 million, and this to a large extent, because of the already
mentioned equity impairments. For the rest, always solid (11:47) ongoing results in Thailand
were offset by a lower contribution from our partnership in Malaysia.
This brings me to the General Account, slide eight. The net result in the third quarter
amounted to €21 million, mainly as a result of the decrease of the RPN(i) liability by €46
million. This absorbed, to a large extent, a negative result of the second quarter and
brings the year-to-date net result to €40 million negative against a loss of €297 million last
year.
Staff and other operating expenses year-to-date amounted to €51 million, up €11 million,
because of higher legacy related costs and higher personnel expenses as there is a lot of
one-offs there, obviously.
The net cash position stood at €1.7 billion, including the €0.3 billion of liquid assets, which
is qualified (13:06).
Lastly shareholders' equity, slide nine, shareholders' equity came down slightly to €10.9
billion, or €51.12 per share. With respect to the evolution of shareholders' equity, I'd like to
add to that explanation, the positive impact coming from a lower evaluation of the AG put
option, now valued at €1.95 billion and a positive foreign currency impact of €111 million.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to end my comments here and to hand over to Frank.

Frank Vandenborre

This is an operator message. I'm pretty sure that we are ready to ask questions. Just a
reminder, that the sound from your line was gone for a couple of seconds. Can you
confirm that we are ready for Q&A right now?

Frank Vandenborre

{BIO 15168443 <GO>}

Yes.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, we are now ready to your questions. Our
first question comes from the line of Matthias De Wit, KBC Securities. Please go ahead.
Your line is open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Matthias de Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. Thanks to take my questions. I got three questions please. First on the
capital gains, if I understand it correctly, just a timing issue where some of these gains
might have been deferred to the fourth quarter. Could you confirm whether that's a
correct reading of the situation? And related to this, I also wonder whether there is any
reason to expect structurally lower level of capital gains going forward or is that not at all
the case?
Secondly, on your holding company cash position, if you look pro forma for the Hong Kong
disposal, you will benefit from around €3 billion in growth cash holding. And I understand
that you're looking at M&A, but maybe not the entire buffer is earmarked for
redeployment. So could you maybe comment whether you see room for extra
shareholder returns on top of what you're currently paying out in ordinary dividends and
buybacks.
And then, lastly, on UK Retail, I guess, that the market remains challenging. So I just
wonder when the earnings would start to improve in line with the – or in the back of the
renewed retail strategy? Thank you.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. I'll give answers on point two and three and then maybe ask Christophe to give
more color on point one there. However, (16:26) you can say that cap gain, as you have
heard in the presentation is for us timing issue. If you look to slide three, in the
presentation, you can see that for the third quarter the difference between last year and
this year was some looking like €131 million less cap gains, including impairments than last
year.

Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2015-11-04

We had last year a big real estate sale in Q3, but I will leave it to Christophe to give (16:57)
my answer on two questions bit more color. The cash position, first of all, we are in the
process of closing the deal in Hong Kong. So as announced, it will be expected
somewhere in the first half year 2016. It will increase, of course, our cash position; I would
say to an amount bit lower than €3 billion refer to, because at the same time, we expect
the cash-out for the acquisition in Portugal. We have the investment in Philippines and also
the running buyback program. But in any case, the amount will be somewhere above €2.5
billion.
And today, we can say that our position did not change in a sense that we keep this
massage to be repeated. (17:46) first priority is to look to insurance, let's say,
opportunities there to expand the business. If not, that we enter in this second use of
cash, which is to (18:00) to shareholders. But, at this moment, I would say, there is no
specific news to be told on the M&A front.
The third question on the UK Retail business, so as also announced by (18:15) intervention,
we have been running cost plus (18:18) here this year. So you could say that the cost to
invest in the alignment of the different retail activities is got under one legal entity with
one common IT system, is almost finished. And we are in a process of looking how we can
better use this capacity. We've got to increase our position towards our end-customers
and also to get more business for our own underwriter area (18:46) out of this activity. So
this is something that normally should be visible in 2016 in better overall contribution in the
Non-Life position we have in UK.

Bloomberg Transcript

You probably take the first part.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you, Bart. So, on capital gain, the answer is yes, I would say, but this is more
timing issue. And as I said in my presentation, we have good hopes to catch up. I would
like to make the following comment. We are faced with the, let's say, (19:27) of the
recognition of the capital gain in real estate. You know that our real estate allocation in
Ageas stands out when you compare with peers. Now we are close to 9% (19:41) so it
means that in our investment return, we rely on real estate maybe more than the others.
We run this portfolio with target return, the target return being about 5%. And it means
that we need, let's say, something like €70 million to €80 million a year of capital gain.
Obviously, this is missing at this moment. But when I said very good hopes to catch up, it
means that we have a transaction, which is underway. And very good hope is to realize
this real estate transaction we have started the building, we have the buyer, the
agreement has been reached. And we are only doing all the regulatory, the buyer is
obliged to in regulatory approval. But we are really on the good way.
So, in that case, we will indeed catch up in Q4. But, last year it was Q3, if I remember
correctly, the year before it was Q4. What is key at the end is to reach the 5% global
return on real estate on a yearly basis and we have good hope this will be the case for
2015 as well. Thank you.

Thank you very much. And moving on to the line of Ashik Musaddi with JPMorgan. Please
go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Yeah. Hi. Good morning, Bart; good morning, Christophe. Just a couple of questions.
Thanks for the clarity on the capital gains. Just a follow-up on that again. Your target –
annual target is around 80 basis points to 90 basis points of guaranteed operating
margin, and at nine months, you're running at 71 basis points. So I just want to check. Is
that 80 basis-point to 90 basis-point an annual target? Or is it like an over-the-cycle
target, i.e., there is a big, big catch-up expected in fourth quarter. So should we remain
optimistic about that? Which – you again mentioned in your last comment, but just want to
check again.

Bloomberg Transcript

And secondly, what is going on with Asia, especially, to Malaysian earnings? Can you give
us some color on the Malaysian earnings? How should we think about that going forward?
Is there any structural issue? Or is it more mainly a bit of volatility that is causing the
numbers to look a bit bad at the moment. So these two questions would be great. Thank
you.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

On the first question, Ashik, I think that it's a very good question. We target margins
where we – that we go for, of course (22:33) annual base that we have already indicated, I
think, also in the past that we also have and certainly in our biggest Life operation in
Europe like Belgium, the possibility also to use your profit sharing decision in order to
reach target, but to be very clear, and it's in line with what Christophe said.
If we would have realized the cap gain on real estate that we had last year, the similar one
this year, it would have been something like a 20 basis points difference on an annual
base. And so we stay confident that this year we will be reaching this target margin of 85
basis points to 90 basis points. But it's not the quarterly target. So – because building like
last year, you cannot (23:24) parts of the year.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Yeah. Absolutely, yeah.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

With respect to Malaysia and there I will hand over to Filip to maybe give some color on
the accounting aspects in Malaysia. What we see in Malaysia that is that we have been for
a number of years a bit more struggling than in the other Asian markets in terms of top
line growth. There has been a period where single premiums were very, very let's say,
Page 7 of 18



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2015-11-04

FINAL

prominent in the top line in the inflow. And over the last few years, there has been a move
to more regular premium and a higher quality of sales to have more impact of renewals.
So what we see now is that since two years, for the first time, we see new business in
regular premium and also renewals going up. So that's the good side. But, of course, we
are a bit below the expectations and the line we had before. On top of that, there are a
number of accounting impacts, and there I suggest Filip to comment on this.

A - Filip Coremans

{BIO 17614100 <GO>}

Thanks, Bart. Hi, everybody.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Hello, Filip.

A - Filip Coremans

{BIO 17614100 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So the weaker growth that Bart referred to in Malaysia is also partly the (24:47) some
economic and political tensions in the country, which has put some weakness in the equity
markets and has pushed up a bit the spread (24:57) on the Malaysian bonds. And Malaysia
has a very specific accounting treatment, where the fixed income books run mark-tomarket through the profit and loss account quite differently from what we have today
under IFRS. And the same goes for the liabilities; they're valued at market rate.
Now if spread increases, the spread increase itself immediately translates in a loss in the
P&L, because that is obviously not taken into account to discount the liabilities, which are
discounted at the risk free rate. Those spread increases and weaker equity markets
mostly are causing pressure on the Malaysian results year-to-date. Looking forward, it
depends largely on how the macroeconomic environment there will evolve, yeah? And
that is a bitter side, the shift in the product mix that we're trying to achieve.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

That's very clear. And just one quick one on Solvency II. I mean, you gave a very strong
presentation recently in London. So thanks a lot for that. But I just want to get some
thoughts how should we think about Solvency II at the moment? Is there any new material
noise that you want to share? Or should we feel comfortable as to what you informed us
at the first half level? Should we continue with that kind of view?

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. I promised during the Investor Day that we will, indeed, start reporting transparent
Solvency figures. We actually did during the Investor Day – as from the year-end onwards.
So, at this moment, I'm not going to give a quarterly update on it. However, maybe one
thing I can add is that we referred during the Investor Day to some uncertainties, which
are still potentially going to impact the Solvency figures, although most of them we felt
they were under control, but we referred to three discussions, which were ongoing at that
time. That was the treatment of bonds and our loans, which are guaranteed by regional
governments or local authorities that discussion is still going on.

Page 8 of 18

FINAL

But, at the moment, what we said is that, indeed, we will not be able to probably treat
them as government debt for the timing being (27:27) reconsider that – that's obviously
for the whole industry by the end of next year. But that impact is very well bearable. It's
about €175 million on the SCR, which is increase of the SCR. But that does not materially
change our results.
And then the other big item that we disclosed that during that day was the treatment on
what we say as our ancillary services, which related to our parking business – to
interparking. And so the combined effect of what is happening there is a minor decrease
of about €150 million on the own funds (28:12) the only two tangible developments over
the last, let's say, quarter that we will (28:19) only things. Other than that, I think everything
is normal and stable.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Yeah. So the recent market volatility is not hurting your Solvency II ratios?

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

It will not – well, in all fairness, I cannot to say that yet, because the calculations will be
performed are still ongoing. Let's be clear that if you look at what happened over the last
months of summer, there has been a strong rebound. Let's not forget that.

Q - Ashik Musaddi

{BIO 15847584 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Thanks a lot. Very clear.

Operator
Thank you very much. And the next question is from the line of Farooq Hanif with
Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi, everybody. Thank you so much for taking my questions. Just a few questions. Firstly, on
impairments, I know these are just accountings. So we should not get too excited by
them. But sometimes, even if markets are flat, you get more impairment just because of
the timing of the accounting rules. So I was just wondering, is there anything in Q4 that we
should bear in mind on impairments based on the current market level?
Secondly, on the reserve releases, in workers' compen of the businesses, where you're
taking actions in Belgium. Again, just wanted to work out how much of the prior year
release year-to-date you would say is exceptional, how much is actually just the reserving
policy as part of your normal underwriting?
And also, just in the UK, you're seeing obviously lagged effects, but it seems that the
pricing outlook's far more positive from what we're seeing that of the UK Non-Life
company is reporting. So just wondering when you think that combined ratio profitability
picture could get better.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Christophe, you take the question on the impairment.

FINAL

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

On the impairment, there is very little room for maneuver. And that's a rule that we apply,
that's an IFRS rule. We have to compare the book value, recurring value with the market
value at the end of the period, so September 30. What was really sad is that September
30 was really among the lowest point. And when we close the account a few days later, it
was even higher. But we had to recognize this. There is no way we can manage.
So it is really the observation of the rules. We apply our rules, which are very similar to
other group. The benchmark with other group has been made and it is the 25% figure,
and then the decreasing value on the one-year basis. But all these things are very
classical. So we have normal hopes and we operate it in an automatic way.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

But you don't hope – as for the recovery means you're not expecting anything big in Q4
as of today?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

In Q4 since the equity markets are much better, we don't expect impairment. As a matter
of fact, we could even reverse some impairment by (31:45) the only way to get rid of
impairment is to sell, and in that case, you recover the impairment and maybe (31:55)
capital gain. But all the markets are more or less 15% higher than they were at the end of
September. So there is larger room to recover a part of this impairment if we want.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Thank you.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. Then the question on releases in Belgium with respect to workers' compensation,
we don't see specific higher releases than in the previous years. What we have seen is
mainly in the first quarter of the year, overall releases in different product lines that over
the year, I think, Christophe mentioned it in the Q1 call would come down. And we see the
release is coming down from something like 13% in Q1 to now slightly above 8%. You
could expect normally that this will be again a bit lower by end of the year. And the main
reasons are that on one hand, we have had quite important strengthening of reserves last
year in Third Party liability where a number of parts have also been closed in the
meantime.
So we see maybe that our extra reserving was from on a conservative view. Also, we have
this (33:16) last year where also – most of the files will be closed. So we see the releases
this year as more a natural evolution of better experience than what we expected. And so

Page 10 of 18

FINAL

we reconsider the combined ratio evolution in Belgium as positive, of course, also led by
good weather events.
Then for the UK, the situation is always a bit more touchy in the sense that the market
remains competitive. We are more than positive about the trend we see of increasing
rates in Motor Insurance. So year-on-year and it depends on which source you look at. But
I would say the most pessimistic sources talk about the 5% increase in rates, where we,
on the other hand, see that the pressure now moves more to Households that has
benefited from very good combined ratios in the past year – in the past nine months.
So we – okay we stay (34:22) and look how we can keep our position while not giving up
too much on profitability. Our combined is now not yet at 97%. We try to work further to
reach that 97% level, obviously, in the UK.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Okay. That's very kind. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you very much. And moving on to line of William Elderkin, Goldman Sachs. Please
go ahead. Your line is open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - William H. Elderkin

{BIO 3349136 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. Just a couple of questions left. First one is just – can you, kind
of, give us a sense of how you're going to book the gain on the Hong Kong disposal,
whether that will go into the Insurance results or the General Account result? And then
related to that, if it is in the Insurance result, when we're thinking about your dividend or
dividend forecast, should we be including or excluding that disposal gain?
And then secondly, just on the UK Motor business, you seem to have some positive prior
year experience, but at the same time, some fairly cautious current year developments.
Can you just give a sense, is this sort of issues specific your own book or something more
market wide, because it just seems as things keep on coming up in your – more than
others in my sense? And really what are the steps that you're putting in place to take you
to this 97% combined ratio objective?

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. I'll pass the first question to Christophe. And then, take the second one.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Okay. So the recognition of the capital gain will be a split between the Insurance operation
and the General Account. Usually, we book the capital gain coming on the sale in local
currency within Insurance parameter and then everything, which is related to FX, is taken
by the General Account. But at this moment, I don't have the split. But that's what we did
when we sold the product in the UK last year.

Okay. Then UK Motor, we don't see a different profile in – for us compared to the market.
What we see is again that – we could see slightly going up because the economic outlook
in the countries is better and people drive again a bit more. And we also see an impact on
the cost of the more big claims. So that's what makes us – it gives us the necessary
attention to further try to improve the profitability in Motor, while it's very good in all the
other branches we commercialize.

Q - William H. Elderkin

{BIO 3349136 <GO>}

Thank you. Can I just come back, in terms of the gain that's going to – the disposal gain
that's going to flow through into the 2016 Insurance earnings from Hong Kong, how
should we think about that in terms of our ordinary dividend forecast or...?

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

In terms of dividend, we have a dividend policy and I – normally we present dividend
proposal to the General Shareholders Meeting and would expect that we apply as we did
in the past, our dividend policy.

And there are no questions in queue. And our next question is from Benoît Pétrarque
from Kepler. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Benoît Pétrarque
Yes. Good morning. It's Benoît Pétrarque from Kepler Cheuvreux. Just to follow up on the
capital gain questions, I was wondering, I mean, do you actually generate capital when you
realize those gains especially on the real estate, as I can imagine, it will be pretty large in
the fourth quarter? Or do you actually already fair value the real estate in your own capital
figure on the Solvency II. So just wondering, if it will be capital buildup or it's just purely a
recycling the figure to P&L.
And then maybe on the cap gains of the margins in Belgium, so, okay, you do rely clearly a
lot on cap gains to make the 85 bps, 90 bps margin. What do you see underlying? So if
you kind of exclude the capital gains from the margin figure and not only look over the
past couple of quarters but just on the long run about what do you see in terms of
underlying trend, please? Thank you.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

I will take the second question. And then I give to one of the colleagues the first one. So
we have – we scale the business Belgium starting from the margin we want to make and
we need to enumerate (39:37) the capital properly. That means that also in all strategic

Page 12 of 18

FINAL

capital allocation, when we include equities and real estate, we of course take to account
that this assets have to use certain percentage that is not necessarily made by for
equities, by the dividend; and for the real estate, by the rent minus depreciation.
That means that realizing capital gains on equities and real estate are, I would say, a
fundamental substantial part of our – the way we do the Life business. And that's the
reason why we always count on a certain volume of cap gains in those two categories to
reach the margin, which is not the cases in bonds, where we are more in a position buy
and hold. And if we make up for gains on bonds, it's more for pure opportunistic reasons
or because we pass threshold.
And that's the reason why it's also important to look to, for instance, the unrealized capital
gains on real estate that we have because, first of all, these are not included in the sales
equity. We use them in our calculation of solvency. But the fact that we have this
deprecation on the portfolio and that we – if we would not, from time of time, realize a
cap gain, unrealized gains always would continue to grow up.
So you can see, if you look (41:16) unrealized gains on real estate always have been quite
flat and that's the combination of depreciation and realization of cap gains. So that is also
the reason why we are quite confident that this margin of, let's say, around 90 basis
points from the Guaranteed business in Belgium is achievable, not only today, but also in
the future.

Bloomberg Transcript

Do you want to take this (41:43) Antonio?

A - Antonio Cano

{BIO 16483724 <GO>}

To pick up on that, the real estate, as Bart said, indeed is not – the unrealized capital gain
is not included in shareholder equity except in the solvency. There we do include both in
Solvency I and in Solvency II. Solvency I, that is 90% of the unrealized gain, is taken into
account in the Solvency ratio. And for this is – this year to-date, for instance, the unrealized
gain effect on the increase of the solvency ratio, for instance, in Belgium is about €125
million like (42:21) that. You can see that there is also an increase in the unrealized
proportion.
So that immediately – and in Solvency II, obviously, we work with the market – mark-tomarket balance sheet, so which included. So realization or not has little capital benefit,
maybe as except for the fact that it reduces a bit the risk on the real estate that you have
sold, but that is not in capital side, that's in the solvency capital requirement side. So we
did included a fairly neutral, when we realize it.

go ahead. Your line is open.

FINAL

Q - Matthias de Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

Yes. Thanks for taking my follow-up questions. Just on the recent decision of the
government to lower the statutory minimum guaranteed rates in group pensions, do you
see any positive implications stemming from that agreement, maybe in terms of releases
of provisions or in terms of growth which could come back in the segment?
Then, just on Asia, again, on the associate line, if you exclude the equity impairments
booked in this segment, what are the main trends that – you spoke about Malaysia, but
maybe you can also comment on China and Thailand, what you've seen during the
quarter in terms of earnings? And then, lastly, just a minor follow-up on litigation, could
you update us on whether anything is happening at this point in time? Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

The first question, Matthias, I'll try not to be too technical, but the reduction in the
guaranteed rate for (44:13) pensions in Belgium. And all-in-all, it's a decision that is in the
first place important for the employers, because it's not a guarantee that insurer has to
give, it's a guarantee that has to be granted by the employer on the pension plans he
creates for his employees. But of course, it was until now, 3.25%, impossible to achieve in
this environment. As there was a lot of pressure to reduce it, it has been reduced.
The positive for us is that as it's now 1.75%. And we are more in guarantee of 1% (44:50),
that – it becomes a bit more affordable for employers to install pension plans. But at the
end, most of the bigger companies, medium companies already have pension plans. So
they are somewhere bound by the agreement they made in the past. So we don't expect
a massive increase of business, thanks to this reduction. And it is still a business line,
where we see in our own portfolio that year-on-year, we – every year continue to grow
our volumes because there is a mandatory configuration of the expense.
The only positive – the major positive for us is that the offer we gave to employers is
much closer to what they are entitled or obliged to give. And that will probably create
more positive sentiment for employers than it was in the past. But we'll keep to be very
strong in that market. We have a market share of 30%, and we don't see it decreasing.
I don't know whether Antonio or Hans want to add something to that or...

A - Antonio Cano

{BIO 16483724 <GO>}

I think the only thing that we might add is that there is also a new rule on how you treat
the past and how you continue the guarantee that were required before the change of
the weight. And actually this changing regulation is also in favor of the second pillar, group
insurance. So all-in-all, we are actually quite happy with the result.

Okay. And then the question on Asia, I will maybe, may more talk about the business and
Christophe can maybe add something on the financial markets. What we see and I think
it's also clear in our press release is that the inflows continue to grow and, of course, we
have this minor growth in Malaysia, but we see – thanks also say efforts to move more
from single premiums to regular premiums, so we see the trends changing. But it will
remain tough especially due to the, let say, the observation Filip made more economically
and politically.
But besides that, China, Thailand, India, of course, small premiums, high growth rate. If
you look to the result from the quarter and you add what has also been said by
Christophe, bit more of half of the impairments stood at – I think, don't have it exactly on
the million, but you will reach somewhere, let's say, corrected result of €45 million, which
is a bit lower than Q1 and Q2, corrected for. But again we don't see it as a negative for –
negative sign or an indication of lowering profits. So we remain let's say confident and
positive for the outlook in Asia.

Q - Matthias de Wit

{BIO 15856815 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. And on litigation?

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Okay. Update on the legal files, without wanting to sound disrespectful to the
proceedings going on. It has been quite busy over the last quarter, but mostly with – I
would say, no new events, to some extent. We at the ruling of FSMA appeal procedure,
which actually boils down to a slight reduction in the fee or the fine that Ageas has to pay.
There are no real new information that came out of that procedure, in fact. So, for us, it's
a moderately positive outcome.
The only remarkable fact which was new for us and also let's say that's why we say
moderately positive is that the judge ruled or at least explained part of the reduction of
the fine with saying that Ageas was not exactly the same as the old Fortis. Of course, we
Page 15 of 18

FINAL

know that that in – let's say, legal proceedings does not carry a lot of rate, but it's good to
hear that somebody else has recognized that we have changed.
The older procedure that has been in the forefront and has been captured by the press is
the (49:45) hearings, these are actually no more no less than that, these are hearing in
first instance, very far and distant away from coming to resolution. And there is also –
maybe the reason why there was so much attention for it is because that is the
investment holding of one of the families behind the – in that group who at that moment
are obviously involved in other proceedings, but also there are little real material or new
material was added to the table. This was expected.
That is also the only proceeding where we may, before the end of the year, have – may, I
say, yeah, depends a bit on the speed of our court, may see something come as in terms
of a judgment.

Bloomberg Transcript

And the third one which is of course the forefront of the last month where the hearings in
the Modrikamen case, you remember Modrikamen, who actually is pleading against, let's
summarize it, Belgian State and BNP Paribas or having bought the Belgium Bank in parts
too cheaply (50:59) and they think that these parties should agree to pay €5 billion to
Ageas.
We are not banking on that yet, because we would like that to be true, but we think is a
very, very, very remote, if not zero chance that may have happen. Aside from that is
looking for damages from Ageas around €70 million, which of course, in case, it brings is
€5 billion, we will happily pay, but that is not what we expect. So also that is proceedings in
first instance far away from coming to any conclusion.
Looking forward and you will find our usual overviews on page 51, 52 and 53 of the
presentation. Aside from the pleadings which just finished for Patrinvest and are ongoing
for Modrikamen, the only judgment we expect before the end of 2015 at the earliest is on
Patrinvest. For the first half of 2016, you can see there on page 53 that pleadings will take
place in the Netherlands with the VEB cases. This is very material pleadings, very
important for us, but also it's in first instance that we may see judgment come on the
Modrikamen case and a few smaller cases in the Netherlands, and that we may see also
the outcome of the Supreme Court pleadings in the FortisEffect case, you remember, that
is about the break-up on the nationalization of the Dutch entities. So that is for the first
half and (52:42) latter part of the first half of 2016.

Q - Jason Kalamboussis

{BIO 4811408 <GO>}

Yes. Hi. Just one question, bit of a follow-up on the Asian earnings. If we take out the
impairments, which maybe are probably €35 million, let's say, you are still at a run rate on
the quarter in Asia that should be around close to let's say €45 million. Is it something with
Hong Kong dropping next year in terms of earnings, should we expect to have – and in
general with China doing pretty well, Thailand doing pretty well, should we expect to have
a run rate that should be somewhere between €45 million and €50 million per quarter
taking into account that Malaysia probably will be stable next year, if anything, and also
that your new ventures will still not be producing any revenues next year with investments
so we will be producing results only in 2017?

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

As you know, (53:55) we don't give outlooks. Reality is of course that for next year, we will
have to take out the results for Hong Kong, which is something like, let's say €40 million
also looking back to past years. But we – on one hand, we will have increasing underlying
books as of technical liabilities move at the highest speed than what we see in Europe.
We don't see reduction of margins. We will, of course, have in the Asian segment a
number of, let's say, costs like the startup cost in Vietnam and Philippines. But, okay, we in
any case, count on the Asian segment continue to have important and increasing
contributions taking out Hong Kong, in the coming years.

And there are no further questions in queue. And with that, I would like to return the
conference call back to the speakers.

A - Bart Karel de Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your good questions. To end this call, let me
summarize some main points.
First of all, it was a third quarter with mix picture, continued strong operating performance
in Non-Life and if we correct for the impairments and lower capital gains in line with the
year margins we expect in Life, very well tight financial markets in Asia and Europe have
resulted in significant activity impairments, but overall, our year-to-date financial results
remain solid and we are confident for the remainder of the year. Lastly, our various
acquisitions and divestment files are on track to be concluded within the foreseeing
timeframe.
And with this, I would like to bring this call to an end. Don't hesitate to contact our Investor
Relations team should you have outstanding questions. Thank you for your time, and I
would like to wish you a very nice day. Good-bye.
