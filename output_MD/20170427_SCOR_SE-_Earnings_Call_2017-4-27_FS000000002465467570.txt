Before we start, Denis Kessler would like to pass on his apologies for not being able to
attend today due to the SCOR Group Board Meeting taking place at present in advance
of this morning's Annual General Meeting. He is joined by Romain Launay. The remainder
of the Comex are here on this call.

And with this, I would like to give the floor to Mark Kociancic, Chief Financial Officer of the
SCOR Group. Mark?

Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Thank you, Ian, and good morning everyone. I have a very simple message for you all
today. At SCOR, we see blue skies, and the group is in excellent shape. SCOR delivers a
strong start to the year and continues to pave the way through combining three key
elements: growth; profitability; and solvency.

Bloomberg Transcript

Firstly, regarding the expansion of the franchise, we've been able to record excellent
profitable growth, with gross written premiums of €3.7 billion in the first quarter of 2017.
And that's up 12.1% at constant foreign exchange rates compared to Q1 2016. It's fuelled
by both of our business engines, SCOR Global P&C and SCOR Global Life.
On the P&C side, we continue to expand the franchise in the U.S. market as per the
strategy laid out in our Vision in Action plan, and in keeping with the strong January
renewals already announced. The April renewals are consistent with selective growth and
stable pricing. In Life, we continue to deliver a strong track record of expanding Longevity
reinsurance. In line with Vision in Action, we are further enhancing the franchise in AsiaPacific with the recent opening of a branch in Japan.
Secondly, regarding profitability, SCOR records a net income of €140 million for the first
quarter, which produced an 8.6% return on equity in line with the Vision in Action
profitability target. You are aware that of the change in the Ogden discount rate, which is
used to calculate lump sum payments in bodily injury cases, this has affected UK long-tail
business lines. As a result SCOR has taken a charge in the first quarter of €116 million on a
pre-tax basis. And this is been mitigated by the favorable natural catastrophe loss ratio in
the first quarter and by a reserve release of €45 million. As you know we use reserve
releases in extreme cases, be it natural catastrophe or regulatory, take the combined
ratio to a normal level of performance in the 94% to 95% range.
The Ogden rate change has been a small cloud in our blue sky that has dissipated. We've
dealt with it all in the first quarter. Had the Ogden rate change not occurred, the net
income would have reached a €197 million, and the return on equity would have stood
12.2%, well above the 800 basis points over the five-year risk free rate profitability target.
Even so, for 2017, the group remains very much on track to reach its Vision in Action
profitability target.
Third, the solvency position of the group remains strong at 224% this quarter, above the
optimal range and stable compared to the year-end position of 225%. Excluding the
negative impact of the change in the Ogden rate amounting to approximately 2 points,
Page 2 of 15



Company N ame: SCOR SE
Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity
Date: 2017-04-27

FINAL

our solvency position would be at the 226% level. SCOR continues to provide an attractive
remuneration policy to its shareholders with a dividend of €1.65 per share. And that's an
increase of 10% year-on-year, which will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting later
on this morning.
Furthermore, I reaffirm the capital return message with regards to share buybacks that we
announced with the fiscal 2016 year-end results. That remains unchanged. Our operating
fundamentals are solid and our solvency and rating capital positions are strong.
Moving on to slide 4. I have mentioned the excellent growth from both divisions already.
Further, both deliver strong technical profitability in Q1 as well, and this is driving the strong
core earnings of the group. The P&C combined ratio stands at 94.5%, and the Life
technical margin is at 7.2%. SCOR Global Investments is delivering a solid return on
invested assets at 2.6% this quarter with continued rebalancing of the portfolio.

Bloomberg Transcript

Going to page 6. Shareholders' equity increased by 2% over the first quarter at €6.8
billion, supported by the net income of €140 million recorded in the quarter. This
corresponds to a book value of €36.35 per share, our record since 2002. Financial
leverage stands at 24%, decreasing by 40 basis points compared to the position as at the
December 31.
Let's move onto page 7. SCOR generated operating cash flows of €22 million. Normalized
for non-recurring items, this stands at approximately €200 million for the quarter and in
line with our plan. SCOR Global Life operating cash flow reflects a delay in the settlement
of retrocession recoverables and claims payment timing differences. Cash flows are
expected to start normalizing during the second quarter of 2017.
On the SCOR Global P&C side cash flows show some seasonality with the first quarter,
usually lower due to retrocession premium settlements. And Q1 2017 also reflects certain
larger loss settlements. The Q1 2016 cash flows were unseasonably high last year. Timing
differences in P&C will normalize by the first half of 2017. Total liquidity of the group
reached €2.1 billion as at March 31 and reduced as planned from the year-end level of €2.3
billion through the rebalancing of the invested assets, despite holding cash in preparation
for the dividend payment in early May.
Let me now hand over the baton to Victor, who will give you more details on the P&C
results.

Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Good morning. We are pleased with the results of the quarter which are more than in line
with the targets and the assumptions of Vision in Action. Picture that comes out of the two
P&C slides that you have in the presentation is very much one of continuity and stability of
excellent performances. It is also a picture of continuity and consistency in terms of
handling exceptional events and absorbing shocks.

FINAL

Starting with the exceptional event of this quarter, the change in the Ogden discount rate
has essentially affected two of our UK portfolios: Non-Proportional Motor; and the Medical
Defense Union Medical Malpractice run-off. It has caused the total impact of €116 million:
€83 million for the Motor Non-Proportional; and €33 million for the Medical Malpractice
run-off.
As we have always done in the past when facing such large events, which are generally
more linked to natural catastrophe, we have used part of the margin above best estimate
in our reserves, and we've done a quantum of reserve releases to absorb part of the
shock. This quantum combined with low natural catastrophe ratio for the quarter brings us
to a net combined ratio of 94.5%, which remains below the 95% to 96% range indicated
for Vision in Action.
It's worth noting that the normalized net combined ratio after neutralization of the Ogden
impact, and the related reserve release, and considering a net cat budget of 6% comes
out at 94%, which is below the level of the past quarters and demonstrate that the quality
of the book of business has been very well-maintained.

Bloomberg Transcript

We continue to deliver excellent technical profitability, which has been unaffected by
market conditions that remain very competitive. And we have managed to grow
premiums at a steady base as shown by the progression of the 1/1 and 1/4 renewals. The
fact that these renewals have been negotiated at almost stable pricing and with almost
no deterioration of the expected technical profitability confirms that we are reaching a
point of market stabilization, if not yet, the point of market upturn.
The 13.2% growth reported for the first quarter benefits from the written premium influx
of the large Proportional contracts that were underwritten in the second part of 2016. You
will recall that these contracts were mentioned when we commented our Q3 2016 results.
As in the past, for example, in 2009, this growth rate will adjust itself over the quarters,
and pending the results of the June, July renewals, we believe that the growth range
indicated in Vision in Action remains valid.
On that, I'd pass on to Paolo for the Life results.

Paolo de Martin

{BIO 15930577 <GO>}

Thank you, Victor. I'm pleased to report that SCOR Global Life had a very good start of
the year with strong results, both with regard to premium growth and profitability of the
business. The first quarter of 2017, we've recorded gross written premium of €2.2 billion,
representing an increase of 12% at constant exchange rate or 14.4% at current exchange
rates. The strong quarterly growth follows an already strong fourth quarter in 2016, where
we wrote some new longevity business in the UK, with premium contributing into 2017.
The growth has been well-diversified, both in terms of geographical spread and product
lines. Besides a new premium from in-force longevity business, we have also recorded
new business flows, particularly, in the Americas and Asia Pacific from protection and
financial solutions, affirming our strong franchise in those regions. With the opening of a

FINAL

branch in Tokyo, demonstrating the importance of Asia-Pacific through our strategic plan,
we will continue to expand our franchise in this region and bring new and innovative
solutions to our Japanese customers.
For the full-year 2017, we expect premium growth to normalize at around the 5% to 6%, in
line with the Vision in Action annual premium growth assumption. Technical results remain
strong with a technical margin of 7.2%. We've been able to deliver this, thanks to both the
profitability of our new business underwritten in line with the group profitability target, as
well as the very healthy performance of the in-force portfolio.
I will now hand over to François for more details on our Group Investments strategy.

François de Varenne

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Paolo. SCOR's total investment portfolio reached €27.9 billion at the end of
March, with an invested asset portfolio of €19.4 billion compared to €19.2 billion at the end
of December 2016. After our close at the end of 2016, due to the political uncertainty,
SCOR Global Investments resumed rebalancing of its invested assets portfolio toward
Vision in Action asset allocation during the first quarter of 2017. Liquidity stands at 10%,
one point lower compared to the end of 2016 level. But temporarily including the
upcoming dividend payment of the group, scheduling to (13:07) 2017.
The most significant change of the quarter is the significant reallocation from government
bonds toward high-quality corporate bonds, such as a good market condition. Indeed, we
were able to invest €1.1 billion in all our main currencies in high-quality corporate bonds
with an average rating of A and allowing to lock a high book yield of 2.85% at an average
duration of 6.8 years. As a consequence, our corporate bonds exposure stands at 44%,
up 6 points compared to the last quarter and in line with Vision in Action asset allocation.
Meanwhile, the duration of the fixed income portfolio was slightly increased from 4.5
years to 4.8 years. Our fixed income portfolio remains of very high quality, with an
average rating of A+. At the end of March, expected financial cash flows for the fixed
income portfolio over the next 24 months stand at €6.1 billion, which will facilitate the
dynamic management of our investment policy.
SCOR Global Investments delivered a solid 2.6% return on invested assets in the first
three months of 2017. It should be noted that in comparison with last year, the Q1 2016
financial contribution was positively impacted by realized gain in real estate of €52 million.
We confirm our 2.7% to 3.2% estimated range for the full year of 2017 according to current
market conditions. This return should benefit indeed from realized gains linked to the sale
of a mature real estate building that should be done before the end of the year.
SCOR Global Investments continues to reinforce its ESG policy, and we announced today
our full divestment from tobacco company, undertaking to make no new financial
investments in such companies in the future. With this action, as a responsible life and
health reinsurer, we demonstrate the crucial positive role the investment community can
play in the society.

Thank you. We'll take our first question from . Your line is open. Please go ahead.

Q - Guilhem Horvath

{BIO 18460437 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Good morning, everyone. I have actually three questions. So, I'll ask them all, and if
you want to answer later. I'm sorry about that. The first one is on the Life technical margin.
So, it improved, and I thought that increasing longevity business would deteriorate that,
actually. So, you highlighted the in-force management, and I wanted to understand how
much it contributed to the technical margin there? And excluding that, would that've been
deteriorating? First question.
The second is in terms of run-off in P&C. And the run-off was made on long-tail lines, and I
wanted to understand what's your view on potentially inflationary pressure on claims in
these lines? And do you feel very comfortable in releasing these results on long-tail lines?
And the third one is on solvency capital generation and the fact that you – excluding of
them you generated 1 point of solvency in Q1 compared to full year 2016. And I wanted to
understand if this is somehow run rate for the coming quarters? And so, should we expect
something like 3 points of solvency during the remaining of the year, solvency capital
generation? Thanks very much.

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Okay. Paolo, on the first question, technical margin at 7.2%

A - Paolo de Martin

{BIO 15930577 <GO>}

Yeah. I think, you guys are used so nicely with this steady 7%. I mean, the 20 basis points
of over €8 billion book of premiums is – it will be normal volatility of the quarter. This
quarter, we had a particularly good performance of our in-force book. We had one-off
transactions that bump the margin up a little bit. It will normalize down, probably slightly
higher than the Vision in Action interval by the end of the year. But that's really, I would say,
normal business, but there was nothing super exceptional in the numbers.

Victor on the inflation...

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

FINAL

Yeah.

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

...expectations given the reserve release?

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

First of all, the reserve release are taken out of the margin, above best estimate. That has
got to be very clear. It's only a very, very marginal fraction of the total reserves, which
were well in excess of €11 billion. And those €45 billion have been spread across, well, four
different lines of business, motor, liability, aviation and marine, across between 5 and 10
portfolios in Europe. So, I think, we are totally comfortable with this sort of reserve
release. As far as for the inflationary pressures on claims, well, we are reviewing the
situation on claims inflation every year. And, again, I mean, we are totally up to speed on
that.

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Frieder, if you could say a few words on the solvency generation capacity.

A - Frieder Knüpling
Yeah. We don't really give forward-looking guidance on solvency ratio movement at this
point. But when it comes to Q1, there was nothing unusual which drove the Q1 numbers.
We've had a slight uptick because of financial market movements, interest rate
movements. We have more than a percentage point and then a few small other
improvements.
And then on the business side, obviously, the Ogden rate impact is quite significant, so
this reduced the solvency ratio by a bit more than 2 points. And then there was normal run
rate capital generation in addition. But you should note that on a quarterly basis in our
estimates, we accrued the expected dividends on a pro rata basis. I don't think everybody
is doing this, so this usually leads to a relatively smooth solvency ratio movements during
the quarter, because we build up the expected dividends, which obviously needs to be
funded out of the capital, which we generate quarter-by-quarter.
There is some seasonality on a quarterly basis. So, the business growth dynamics are not
equally spread out over the quarters. And also capital generation is a function of the
business mix in the respective quarters. So, there is some volatility, which is also caused
by business mix and growth dynamics during the year.

Q - Guilhem Horvath

{BIO 18460437 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

FINAL

Operator
We'll move to our next question from Vinit Malhotra. Your line is open. Please go ahead.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. So, my two questions. One is on the strong normalized combined
ratio. Victor, would you say that there was anything very different, because this is obviously
much lower, much better than what we were expecting and what is in the target range? Is
there any one-off here, or is it something that just the effect of stabilization, that you're
seeing in the market, I mean, pricing terms? And the second question is just on the –
slightly weird, I apologize, from the U.S. proposals on tax. I mean, is there any rough
estimate from what happens to solvency or DTAs or any such thought process from your
side on this proposal? Thank you.

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Victor, on the 94% normalized combined ratio.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Well we are in the third quarter of the Vision in Action plan. And as for the previous two
quarters, we have said that, we have managed until now to continue much more on
optimal dynamics, which was basically a combined ratio between 94% and 95%. And as
you will recall, we have been on normalized combined ratio around 94.3% to 94.5% for
quite some time. It's a bit better this quarter.
There's nothing special into it. It's is just that the normal development of the business is
positive, which means that it reinforces our conviction that the underwriting is very strong.
But between 94% and 94.3%, I mean, the difference is not that huge. But it shows a trend,
and what is important for us is that for the moment, we continue to be able to manage
the combined ratio around the 94%, 94.5%. And we are not yet in the metrics of Vision in
Action, which we're more 95%, 96%.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

On the second question with respect to the U.S. proposals on income tax reduction. So,
there's a wide range of tax rates that are being floated around, as potential lending
points in the U.S. I'll just give you a general proposal as to how it might affect existing
DTAs that we have. So, roughly, there's between a €2 million and €3 million charge for
each percentage point of decrease in the U.S. corporate income tax rate. That's a rough

Page 8 of 15



Company N ame: SCOR SE
Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity
Date: 2017-04-27

estimate. I think it is a net positive for us though, because we have such an expensive
extensive operation in both the U.S. Life and U.S. P&C organization, so there would be a
net positive benefit in the long-term with a lower income tax rate in the United States.

We'll move to our next question from Kamran Hossain. Your line is open, please go ahead.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning, everyone. Three questions, the first one is, I guess, following the
Ogden change (25:35) this quarter, can you maybe give an indication of what you expect
to happen to prices, especially in the UK Non-Proportional Motor reinsurance market?
That's question one.
The second question just coming back to, I guess, mix of long-tail versus short-tail
business in P&C. Could you give an indication of what this looks like year-on-year? And
have we seen a substantive move towards long-tail? As I know that was one of the things
you indicated that would happen over the three-year plan period? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Victor?

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

As far as the market reaction to Ogden, I think it's too early to really say. I think we knew
technically what is the impact on pricing of excess of loss reinsurance due to Ogden rate
change. We are waiting for, first, the consultation and the outcome of it. I think as the rest
of the market does probably. And I think we will see that 1/7 renewal. That's the first one.
The consultation should be done by then. We'll have a better feel about what's going to
be the market reaction. But it so appears that on the technical point, I mean, this makes a
very, very substantial difference in pricing. And the higher the access point is, well, the
more that multiple increases.
Regarding the split between long-tail and mid-tail, because you need to divide more in
Sweden in two, we have a bit of an increase on few long-tails, we should divide the
portfolio in between short-tail, mid-tail, long-tail. Short-tail is, say, around 45%; the mid-tail
is about a bit less than 35%; and long-tail is a bit above 20%. So, now, if we look year-onyear, we are increasing the long-tail, we were in the 20%, 21%. We are now in the 23%,
24%. So, I mean, it's like a tanker, it doesn't move at a very high speed, but it is significant,
yes, in terms of movement.

Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just two for me. So, firstly, just thinking
ahead to June 1, July 1, renewals. I've read a bit in the sort of industry journals, that
demand has been falling in the U.S., in particular, from primaries and also due to a bit of
model change from RMS, so any comments there would be interesting? And secondly,
there's been growing sort of criticism of broker practices, and commission levels, and
Lloyd's of London ,in particular in recent weeks as well. So ,just any, any comments from
you guys there would be appreciated. That's all Thanks.

On your question, the first question is very much focusing on pure CAD (29:09) business
in the U.S., and again, within that focusing on Florida, which is not a big play for us. So, I
think, yes what you say is right, but we are not going to be affected by this movement
ourselves, because of the portfolio structure, nature, and clients, and geography. While
the second regarding the levels of commissions and brokers, well I have read those
comments, but I think that everyone has got his own view about that. And personally, I'm
not willing to comment on this.

ahead.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning, guys. Two questions. The first one would be for Victor, just to come
back on the Ogden rate reserve strengthening. So, just to better understand, what was
the starting point in terms of reserves you were holding on the UK Motor, just to put the
€83 million into context? And also, to better understand, you are talking of NonProportional book reserve strengthening, have you as well as some Proportional exposure
here or is that insignificant or does not matter too much in light of the Ogden rate table?
And also, the second question will be, I think, that Paolo mentioned a kind of normalization
of the premium growth over the full year, so moving from 12% to roughly 5% to 6%. Victor,
could you also give us a bit of, what is your current view regarding the full-year premium
income you are expecting at this stage, following Q1 strong year performance? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Let me give you some facts on Ogden and demonstrate how transparent we are. We
estimate our market share of Proportional and Non-Proportional UK Motor at about 3.5%.
We used to have a larger share on Proportional, but considering market conditions, we
have aligned basically to about 3.5% on both.
Now, the deterioration, we have taken in relation to Ogden have all been on 2011 and in
subsequent years. Two-thirds of the deterioration is on 2014 to 2017, where we have no
paid losses, so that is where we are. We would have been sufficiently reserved if the rate
had gone down to 1%. We have always had a prudent reserve. We did not foresee and
anticipate a large reduction in the discount rate and certainly not it going to be negative.
So, that's where it gives you, well, the picture of where we were.

Bloomberg Transcript

As to growth for the entire year, as I said, you've seen our renewals, Jan 1. You've seen
our renewals, April 1, even though the April 1, is a bit impacted by two one-offs, but you
can see that, we are within the range of Vision in Action. We're around the 5%, 6% at the
moment. But we are waiting for first, well for June, July renewals, to get a bit clear on
where we are going. I think, it's obvious that as market conditions are stabilizing, but still
very competitive, and we are also extremely focused on the technical profitability. Well,
we have to take views on certain contracts, which happen at 1/4, so we've got to see how
the June, July renewals develop.

We'll move to our next question from William Hawkins. Your line is open. Please go ahead.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Hi. Thank you. I think that you've just answered the half of my questions. I was to ask about
Ogden, why this has affected the P&L, because I would have thought that such an event
was covered by your bulk IBNR. But it sounds like in your answer to the previous question,
you're saying that would have been the case if the rates had gone down to 1%. But the
fact we've ended up such a negative, that's why it ends up affecting the P&L. Just to
confirm if I've understood that correctly.
And then what you didn't answer from the previous question is what the reserves were
before this charge was taken? That would be useful just to understand the scale of the
impact to the portfolio affected. Thank you.

Right. I mean if it would have gone to 1%, we would have no impact. Secondly, the
reserves were a bit north of €300 million before Ogden.

We'll move to our next question from Frank Kopfinger. Your line is open. Please go ahead.

Q - Frank Kopfinger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning, everybody. I have other two questions. My first question is on P&C.
Victor, could you comment a little bit more on the reserve margin, how this develops after
the reserve release? Do you see it on the same level, or how much did it affect the
margin at the end of the day?
And the second question is for François. If I got you correct, and you mentioned that there
might be realized gains from property being ahead on the cost of the year. Should we
expect the same magnitude than we had at the last year, or what should be the
expectation in this end?

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

We are talking of the magnitude of release, which is very comparable to the one we did
last year, and when we faced the report on Fort McMurray fires. And as we commented at
the end of the year, we had been able to replenish the margin by the end of the year. So,
I think, we are at this year, in the same configuration. We have a hit on the margin in the
first quarter, which is not massive, and we are hoping that by the end of the year, we will
have replenished the margin.

A - François de Varenne
So, the second question on the investment returns for the full-year. So, yes, I confirm that
we launched the sale process of the mature building billing, exactly in line with what we
did in 2016. And you saw the impact in Q1. So, we expect the finalization of this sale
process by the end of the year, probably an impact more – we should expect it in Q4. The
magnitude is in line with the expectation for the full year that I gave in the presentation of
the Q4 result. So, still, an income yield between 2.1% and 2.3% and the contribution of
realized gain that should be between 0.5% yield.

Q - Frank Kopfinger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi, there. Just one question from me. Can you please shed some more light on the U.S.
two large contracts that is mentioned on slide 9. The reduction in premium from €93
million to €49 million, what's really driven that. That's all from my side? Thank you.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Well, I can't say much more about that. I can tell you that one contract has disappeared
because of consolidation by the client. The other contract is a voluntary cancellation from
our part, because the contract was not providing the expected profitability we were
looking for. One is property...

Q - Vikram Gandhi

Okay. Thank you.

FINAL

Hi. Good morning. I have just one question. It was for François. I think you said on the 4Q
conference call that you expect 2017, the return on invested asset to be in the upper half
of the 2.7% to 3.2% range. Could you please comment on that in light of the 1Q return on
invested assets and reinvestment yield please?

A - François de Varenne
What I said in Q4, and I reiterate today is that our expectations for the full-year 2017 return
on invested asset would be in the high part of the range given for Vision in Action in
September 2017. So, 2.7%, 3.2%. And at this stage, again given what we are doing on the
real estate portfolio and the sale process, I'm pretty confident that we will be in this
range. It's a little bit too early to reduce the range today. I'd prefer to wait for the
development of market environment for the full year. I confirm the 2.7%, 3.2%, which is the
other part of Vision in Action expectation.

Q - Xin Mei Wang

{BIO 16662657 <GO>}

All right. Okay. Thanks.
