Presentation
Operator
Good day, and welcome to the Gjensidige Q1 2020 Results Presentation. Today's
conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to
Ms.Mitra Hagen Negard, Head of IR. Please go ahead.

Mitra Hagen Negard

{BIO 3974076 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to this ﬁrst quarter
presentation of Gjensidige. My name is Mitra Negard, and I'm Head of Investor Relations.
As always, we will start with our CEO, Helge Leiro Baastad, who will go through the
highlights of the quarter followed by our CFO, Jostein Amdal, who will run through the
numbers in further detail. And we will have plenty of time for a Q&A at the end.
Helge, please?

Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Mitra. Good morning, and welcome everyone. I hope you are
healthy and well. These are extraordinary times for all of us with the world facing
unprecedented challenges in the wake of COVID-19 pandemic. The situation is evolving

rapidly, and although we have seen positive signs in some countries the true scale of the
crisis is uncertain, and it is very diﬃcult to predict when and how the world will pull
through.

FINAL

Our business has been impacted by the situation, although it is manageable. In this trying
time, our top priority at the Gjensidige is the health and safety of our employees,
customers, business partners and our other stakeholders.
We have implemented multiple precautionary measures, including transition to remote
work from the majority of our employees, and highly stringent travel restrictions. We
speed up our digital transformation enabling us to maintain high customer service levels,
and we have maintained all critical business functions. I will return to status on our
operations shortly, but ﬁrst some comments on our ﬁrst quarter results on Page 2.
We delivered a solid underwriting result oﬀset by eﬀects from the ﬁnancial market turmoil.
We generated a loss before tax income of NOK497 million. The loss was driven by the
signiﬁcant negative return of NOK1.5 billion on our investment portfolio. The COVID-19
pandemic caused a dramatic downturn in the ﬁnancial markets towards the end of the
ﬁrst quarter with a broad based decline for most asset classes. The pandemic situation
had a limited impact on the group's underwriting result for the ﬁrst quarter, which came
to a solid NOK1,058 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

Premiums increased by 10.7%, reﬂecting strong renewals and eﬀective pricing measures.
The combined ratio was a healthy 83.9%. This is a very good level for a ﬁrst quarter,
primarily reﬂecting the strong premium development and favorable weather conditions.
The pandemic situation drove a signiﬁcant increase in travel insurance claims, but this was
oﬀset by reinsurance coverages and lower motor claims during the lockdown. Large
losses came in somewhat lower than expected and runoﬀ gains were slightly higher than
the planned releases. And our cost discipline remains strong. Jostein will revert with more
detailed comments on the results for the quarter.
Then turning to Page 3, and a few comments on the latest update on our dividend. Our
board has decided to withdraw our dividend proposal for 2019 in compliance with the
regulatory stance clearly communicated in meetings with the FSA. This comes despite our
very strong capital position. It is important to emphasize that our dividend policy remains
unchanged, and the board's intention is to distribute dividends to shareholders as soon
as the situation will allow for it. In-line with previous years practice, the board will seek
authorization to distribute dividends late this year, giving us ﬂexibility to address the
question as soon as possible.
The Annual General Meeting is now scheduled for May 25, and will be organized in-line
with necessary safety measures to safeguard health and contain the virus spread. Instead
of physical presence our shareholders will be able to participate via our live webcast.
Questions can be sent to us beforehand and we encourage our shareholders to use the
possibility to vote before the meeting. The notice with all relevant details will be
published and sent to shareholders shortly.

FINAL

Then turning to Page 4. And a few words about how we see our role in supporting our
societies in these trying times. For more than 200 years, Gjensidige has sought to create a
sense of security for our customers by safeguarding life, health and assets in a sustainable
way. We recognize our important role in the situation we are all facing.
Many of our customers have had their lives turned upside down, the pandemic has forced
them to change the way of life and needs, at least for now. We recognize the need for
ﬂexibility and good advice. In order to meet these new circumstances we have stepped
up our advisory role in the dialogue with our customers helping them assess and adjust
coverages to the new situation.
The situation has changed customer's digital behavior with a signiﬁcant increase in online
reporting of travel claims in motors and search in the use of online doctor and vet
services. We have extended our online vet service to include our agriculture customers
contributing to better livestock, health as well as providing a practical solution to the
limitations caused by the ongoing virus pandemic.

Bloomberg Transcript

Catering to this important sector, we recently invested in the tech company MIMIRO,
which develops a digital ecosystem for the agricultural sector. This will improve our
understanding of risks and sharing of data among farmers with the aim of improving the
eﬃciency and sustainability of food-production in the Norwegian agricultural sector. As
market leader, it's important for Gjensidige to continuously develop even more relevant
production -- products to support damage prevention.
Digital interaction requires precautionary measures too. We have recently entered into
agreement with KeepItSafe, which complements our cyber insurance oﬀering to
customers by providing backup solutions. We know many people experience a
sustainable pressure these days, both mentally and ﬁnancially. To help them in the
situation, we have established a service in the cooperation with SOS International, oﬀering
psychosocial counseling from trained nurses. This service also provides advice on
available government support to all our private customers.
And we are in the process of establishing a project to help people in need. In particular
we will look closer at how we can help adolescents in a situation where social isolation
reinforces loneliness and challenges related to mental health. Gjensidige has granted
NOK25 million to the project, and we are in dialogue with a potential partner to join in
and promote this important contribution to our society together with us.
Turning then to Page 5. I would like to elaborate on our solid operations. As mentioned,
we had put in action an eﬀective response to the situation. The majority of our employees
across the group are now working from home. Thanks to our employees' strong
dedication and capability of a solid IT infrastructure, and a collective eﬀort to accelerate
the digitalization. We have managed a smooth transition to a highly digital business in a
very short time. We have secured all critical functions and been there for our customers
with full capacity through these diﬃcult times.

FINAL

Accessibility has been high, enabling handling of a large number of customers inquires
with a low response time. We have had almost 50% higher daily chat volumes How? With
the same good accessibility as normal, and 95% of all customers calling us have got a
response with 60 seconds, despite a high share of our customers' handlers working from
home.
As mentioned earlier, the COVID-19 situation has so far had a limited impact on our nonlife business. We have seen higher travel insurance claims related to cancellations and
helping customers abroad. This has to some extent been oﬀset by somewhat lower motor
claims. We expect to see further impact on claims as the year proceeds although, we
expect this to be manageable. However, a long-lasting or comprehensive development of
the pandemic situation can have a signiﬁcant negative eﬀect on economic growth and in
turn impact insurance volumes.
Turning back to the quarter, I'm very pleased, that we have managed to maintain our solid
market position in Norway. We have put through necessary price increases both in the
private and commercial segments. Volumes in the private segment has stabilized at a
good level. And the fact that our retention rate in the private segment has remained at a
high level is a strong vote of conﬁdence from our customers.

Bloomberg Transcript

The strong development in our commercial segment contributed in the ﬁrst quarter with
strong renewals and portfolio growth. The retention rate remained at a solid 92%. We see
further need for price increases and we will continue to address the relevant segments
particularly large corporates.
Our operations outside Norway continue to progress. The pandemic can have an impact
on premium growth outside Norway as well. However, we believe we have a
strengthened base to meet this, and we will continue to focus on cost eﬃciency and
improving customer experiences and loyalty.
And with that, I will leave the word to Jostein to present the Q1 results in more detail.
Thank you.

Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Thank you, Helge, and good morning, everybody.
I'll start on Page 7. We delivered a loss before tax of NOK497 million in the ﬁrst quarter.
The solid underwriting result just north of NOK1 billion is signiﬁcantly up from the same
quarter of last year. The Private, Commercial and Danish segments drove this
improvement, thanks to the eﬀective pricing measures, as well as very strong renewals
and portfolio growth for the two latter segments.
As Helge mentioned, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a limited impact on the group's
underwriting result. Claims related to travel insurance increased signiﬁcantly, but
reinsurance coverage limited net claims incurred to NOK91 million, of which NOK60
million is recognized in the corporate center. Lower motor claims, due to the favorable

FINAL

weather conditions and less driving during the latter part of the quarter, had a positive
impact on claims in the private segment.
The Swedish and Baltic segments delivered higher results than last year, when excluding
runoﬀs. Proﬁt from our pension business was lower than last year, driven by lower ﬁnancial
income due to the ﬁnancial turmoil and higher operating expenses. Our investment
portfolio was signiﬁcantly hit by the ﬁnancial turmoil in the wake of the pandemic. We had
negative result of NOK1.5 billion.
Turning to Page 8. Earned premiums were up 10.7% or 8.8% adjusted for currency eﬀects.
In the private segment earned premiums rose by almost 7% mainly due to price increases
for motor and property insurance. The increase was 6.5% when adjusting for the transfer
of a product insurance portfolio to the Danish segment. Our competitiveness remained
strong through the quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

Earned premiums for the commercial segment rose almost 9%. Thanks to eﬀective pricing
measures, solid renewals and portfolio growth. All the main product lines recorded higher
earned premiums. We will continue the price increases to at least reﬂect expected claims
inﬂation but in a diﬀerentiated way, so that for some customers and segments, the price
increases will be higher.
Earned premiums in Denmark were up 12.5% in local currency. Adjusted for the
discontinuation of a quota share reinsurance contract as well as a product portfolio
moved from Private to the Danish segment, the underlying growth in local currency was
7.9%. The strong development came as a result of a very strong January renewal in
addition to new business. Going forward, we expect growth in-line with the rest of the
market.
Earned premiums for our Swedish operation were up 1.7% in local currency. Reﬂecting
eﬀective price increases in the commercial portfolio, partly oﬀset by a decrease in the
private portfolio. We will continue increasing prices in Sweden too, particularly in the
commercial space.
For the Baltics, we report a premium increase of 3.5% in local currency. Reﬂect the volume
growth in the motor and accident and health insurance lines. This was oﬀset by somewhat
lower prices as a result of ﬁerce competition, particularly for motor. Our long-lasting or
comprehensive development of the pandemic situation can have a signiﬁcant negative
impact -- eﬀect on economic growth and in turn impact the insurance volumes. However,
we do not expect any substantial impact on claims in such a scenario.
Turning over to Page 9. We generated a loss ratio at 68.9% for the ﬁrst quarter, down 2.8
percentage points compared with the ﬁrst quarter of 2019. The underlying frequency loss
ratio improved by a solid 6.4%, primarily driven by higher premiums following strong
renewals and eﬀective pricing measures across the group.
I'm particularly pleased with the development in Norway and Denmark, with a very
promising January renewal process and growth in the commercial portfolios. The Private

FINAL

segment in Norway also performed very well, implementing necessary pricing measures
particularly for motor and property segments without shedding volumes. Motor claims in
private developed favorably during the quarter, due to more favorable weather
conditions in Norway and less driving during the latter part of the quarter.
The underlying frequency loss ratio in Sweden was somewhat higher in the ﬁrst quarter,
driven by the private portfolio. Partly oﬀset by eﬀective pricing measures for motor and
property in the commercial portfolio. The underlying frequency in loss ratio in the Baltics
improved, mainly due to favorable weather conditions compared to the ﬁrst quarter of
last year. The COVID-19 related travel insurance claims of NOK91 million is regarded as a
one event and included in large losses, which although lower than expected, were in total
somewhat higher than the same quarter of last year. Runoﬀ gains were somewhat lower
than last year, although a tad higher than the planned release.
Let's turn to Page 10. We recorded NOK989 million in operating expenses in the quarter,
corresponding to cost ratio of 15%, and 14.3% excluding the Baltics. The cost ratio of our
combined Norwegian operations was broadly in-line with the same quarter of last year,
reﬂecting continued cost discipline as well as necessary measures to enhance future
proﬁtability. The developments outside Norway moves more in leaps and bounds as a
consequence of ongoing eﬃciency measures and the size of the portfolios.

Bloomberg Transcript

Denmark reported a relatively stable cost ratio. However, in nominal terms, the operating
expenses were up. The main drivers were the depreciation of Norwegian Krone, lower
commissions under discontinued quota share reinsurance program and impairment of
receivables.
Sweden and the Baltics reported lower expense ratios compared with the ﬁrst quarter of
2019 and also lower costs when measured in local currency. We'll continue our focus on
simpliﬁcation of processes, automation of internal operations and further digitization. And
we expect further eﬃciency gains from our eﬀorts, particularly in Sweden and the Baltics.
In general, we expect that the lessons we've drawn oﬀ from adapting to the pandemic
situation will increase the speed of change towards more digitization and automation to
the beneﬁt of our customers and our business.
A few comments on our Pension operation on Slide 11. The pretax proﬁt came to NOK36
million, down from the same quarter last year, due to lower net ﬁnancial income and
higher operating expenses. Annualized return on equity came to 11.7%. The decline was
due to lower ﬁnancial returns following the market turbulence, non-recurring gains from
divestments last year and higher operating expenses. And other management income
rose year-on-year, the growth was somewhat subdued due to a decrease in assets under
management towards the end of the quarter.
Operating expenses increased due to a shortened depreciation time frame for IT
investments and higher head counts in response to the growth in business volume. Our
pension operations managed NOK33.5 billion in assets at the end of the quarter, this was
down approximately NOK4 billion from year-end 2019, due to the loss of one large

FINAL

account and a negative development in the ﬁnancial markets. The ratio of shared
customers with our general insurance business is high. As of the end of the ﬁrst quarter,
68% of the customers in our Pension business were general insurance customers as well.
Moving on to the investment portfolio on Page 12. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a
signiﬁcant downturn in the ﬁnancial markets towards the end of the ﬁrst quarter, with a
broad-based decline for most asset classes. Leading stock indices had a sharp decline,
and interest rates declined while credit spreads widened signiﬁcantly. Despite signiﬁcant
portfolio de-risking our investments took a hit with a negative result of NOK1.5 billion or
minus 2.5% for the quarter. At the end of the quarter, the total investment portfolio
amounted to NOK61.9 billion.
The match portfolio yield a return of minus 1% on the portfolio of NOK36 billion. Bonds at
amortized cost performed relatively well, with positive return of 1%. This portfolio is
running yield at the end of the quarter, and the investment grade for the quarter was
3.5%. Unrealized excess values amounted to approximately NOK0.5 billion.

Bloomberg Transcript

The free portfolio yielded a negative return of 4.6% in the quarter, driven by weak equity
markets and credit spread widening. At the end of the quarter, the portfolio amounted to
approximately NOK26 billion. All asset classes, except for property and money market
were down during the quarter.
We are prepared for further market turbulence for quite some time, and although we
cannot avoid the impact, we have as mentioned made signiﬁcant changes to our portfolio
during the quarter to mitigate the eﬀects from the market turmoil. We have a solid ﬁxed
income portfolio with a large majority having an investment grade rating, and we have a
good share of property investments mainly in CBD oﬃces.
Looking at the capital position on Page 13. Our capital position is extremely strong, with a
solvency ratio of 269% at the end of the quarter. This is far above the upper end of our
target range of 150% to 200%, which is what we deem necessary to run the business with
a suﬃcient buﬀer for volatility above the regulatory capital requirement. This combined
with the result year-to-date in price that we don't expect to meet our above 20% target on
the return on equity for 2020.
As you can see from the chart here, if we had maintained a dividend proposal of NOK7.25
per share the solvency margin would have been 233%. And if we have maintained the
initial dividend proposal made by the board back in January, the margin as of now would
have been at 207%. As Helge said, our dividend policy remains unchanged, and it is our
boards' intention to distribute dividends to shareholders as soon as the situation will allow
for it.
Turning to Page 14, the increase in solvency margin from the end of 2019 is mainly driven
by changes in the proposed dividend for 2019. If you adjusted for the changes in
dividend, the solvency margin is ﬂat from last quarter. This results from a combination of
negative investment results and de-risking the asset side during the quarter. The solvency
margin based on our own partial internal model was 331%.

FINAL

Solvency II earnings and return in the free portfolio generated a loss of NOK1.3 billion,
which is less than the accounting loss of NOK0.5 billion. The diﬀerence is mainly driven by
lower interest rates, which results in higher technical operations both for general
insurance and life insurance business.
In addition, the planned runoﬀ results had a positive eﬀect in accounting ﬁgures but no
eﬀect on the Solvency II earnings. The capital requirement decreased from the last
quarter. This is mainly driven by the de risking of the investment portfolio, which reduced
the market risk signiﬁcantly. Although it is partly counteracted by underwriting risk, which
increased as a result of growth and changes in currency rate. Note that the solvency
margin for the life company Gjensidige Pensjonsforsikring also is very satisfactory with a
solvency margin of 152%. This is up from 140% at the year-end 2019. Lower interest rates
and lower market value for the unit linked portfolio contributed negatively, while the
reinsurance agreement for lapse risk contributed positively.

Bloomberg Transcript

Finally, a few words on the latest development of our operational targets on Slide 15. We
can report good progress despite the majority of our employees working from home
now-a-days. We are proud to say that our customers are well taken care of, and that our
critical systems have been fully functional during the extraordinary circumstances we have
witnessed the past weeks.
Customer satisfaction remains very high, and we have moved up a percentage point in
customer retention in Norway, after a very strong January renewal across the group. Sales
eﬀectiveness has risen further this quarter, currently at 8.9% compared with our baseline
year 2017, mainly driven by higher sales in Norway. The share of automated tariﬀs
continues to increase, thanks to the latest inclusion of tariﬀs on dogs, cabins and
commercial cars. We stand at around 45% currently and we'll continue to include more
product lines going forward.
On the claims handling side, we saw an increase in both digital claims reporting and in
the share of claims handled fully automatically. As an example, I would like to mention
that 96% of reported travel claims in March were made digitally. We continue to develop
these digital services further and we're well on track to deliver on both targets. We have
also reduced claims cost further and are half way through to reaching our target of
reducing it by NOK500 million in 2022. And in terms of our CO2 intensity, we established
a starting point for measuring CO2 equivalents in 2019 based on our model for estimating
consumption of materials in motor and property claims.
Our carbon intensity was 1.7 tons CO2 equivalents per million NOK in the earned
premiums. The biggest climate footprint in our claims process is driven by motor
insurance. We will continue to develop our models from consumption materials and use
these climate accounts to continue working on selecting materials that help to reduce the
carbon footprint of our claims processes.
I will then hand the word back to Helge.

FINAL

Yes. To sum up on Page 16, we have delivered strong underwriting results in a challenging
environment. Our investments are naturally prone to market ﬂuctuations. However, with
the measures we have taken and the high quality of our assets, we are on a strong footing
to meet any future turmoil.
The pandemic is far from over, and we will have to learn to live with it for a while. Perhaps
it will change the way the world does business for good. Our organization has proved
capable to deal with the uncertainty and turn around quickly. We will make sure to take
the key learnings with us. The fast-track digitalization and our collective eﬀorts to ﬁnd
solutions in a challenging environment will continue post COVID.
Our operational platform is solid and together with our very solid capital position, I'm
convinced that we are in a very good position to cope with the future. We remain ﬁrmly
committed to exert strong capital discipline and will address the question on dividends as
soon as the possible arises. Our ﬁnancial targets remain unchanged. Given the negative
return on the investment portfolio for the ﬁrst quarter of 2020, and the solvency ratio
being signiﬁcantly above what is needed to support our business. The Group's return on
equity target is not expected to be achieved for 2020 ﬁscal year. We remain committed to
supporting our employees, customers, partners and society at large during this uncertain
and challenging time.
We will now have a short break before we open up for Q&A session. Thank you.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Question And Answer)
Thank you, sir. (Operator Instructions) We will now take our ﬁrst question from Jonathan
Denham from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Q - Jonathan Denham

{BIO 19972914 <GO>}

Good morning. Thank you very much for taking my question. I missed some of the
presentation as the phone connection is quite bad. So, I apologies if you've already
addressed this. And ﬁrst just wondering what the magnitude of the reduction in motor
claims in Norway was for say in the last week of March? And then just wondering what
your expectation is for future net travel claims? So what's happening in 2Q and so maybe
you could tell me on how your reinsurance is structured there? Thank you.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

The combination of a benign weather situation and the reduced activity due to the
measures to contain the pandemic together has of course reduced the motor claims. I
don't have a speciﬁc number for how much is related to each of these, and it's a bit hard
actually to come up with that. Going forward, we do see that the motor traﬃc is of course

Page 9 of 23

FINAL

reduced and this will help us to aﬀect on the claims situation for motor since most people
are working from home. I don't have a speciﬁc number for that.
We do expect that travel claims will increase, that we have seen less than half of the travel
claims related to the situation, but without giving a speciﬁc number of that. The
reinsurance is constructed so that within a certain time period there is a retention that will
-- everything about that, the retention level is taken care of by the re insurers. And as you
talked about in the ﬁrst quarter. The last two weeks of March were way above this
retention levels, so we had a positive -- quite substantial positive eﬀect of reinsurance in
the ﬁrst quarter.

Q - Jonathan Denham

We would now take our next question from Matti Ahokas from Danske Bank. Please go
ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. It's Matti Ahokas from Danske Bank. Three questions, please. Firstly,
always the line was pretty bad, but I -- if you can conﬁrm, Helge that you mentioned that
you intend or you are still looking to pay the 2019 dividend late this year, if I heard you
correctly. The second question is if you could a bit elaborate more on the Danish
situation, obviously helped by currencies, but extremely kind of strong results and a kind
of step-up even with some of the kind of intangible write downs. So is this the kind of
level we should be looking forward, going forward? Or is there something special on this
front?
And then a technical question, if the solvency margin was too benign now, how much was
the kind of comparable solvency margin at the end of the year, so in Q4? I didn't have
time to do the math, but that would be very helpful to know how much was the impact of
the market turmoil on the solvency margin? Thanks.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Good morning, Matti. Jostein will handle question two and three. When it comes to
dividend, I think, I said, something like this that we in line with previous years' practice.
The Board will seek authorization to distribute dividends later this year. And it's important
to emphasize that our dividend policy remains unchanged, and it's absolutely Board's
intention to distribute dividend to shareholders as soon as possible and later this year. So
yes, ﬁrst question.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

For the question regarding Denmark, I think we obviously had a very good renewal at this
January 1st, which is a large renewal date also in the Danish market. And leading to, I

would say, an above expected growth in the portfolio. So going forward, we do expect to
grow in line with the market. This also points back to the proﬁtability situation is now quite
okay and in line with kind of where we expected that it should be. So you couldn't -- you
can't extrapolate the growth but you could approximately extrapolate the proﬁtability
situation. Solvency at the year-end, if we had taken out the dividend, so it comparable to
the 269% would have been 265%, so a slight increase due to a lower -- yes, so that's in a
way fairly ﬂat.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

And what was the reason for the solvency margin increase the equity stress? Or how come
it was up?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Since it's the margin, it depends on the movements both in the denominator and the
numerator and the -- so it's -- for practical purposes, it's ﬂat. If we've taken out the
NOK12.25 per share as we initially proposed it would have been 207% at both points in
time. So it's about how the denominator moves as well there.

Bloomberg Transcript

As we said the development in solvency capital is two-fold. One is of course that we have
a solvency to earnings loss, mainly due to the -- or only due to the investment side. And
but on the other hand, a reduction in the capital requirement mainly from the de risking of
the asset side. Those two factors are the main drivers for the movements. But the net
eﬀect is a fairly ﬂat development in solvency margin.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Great. Thanks, Jostein.

Operator
We will now take our next question from Blair Stewart from Bank of America. Please go
ahead.

Q - Blair Thomson Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning. I've got three questions. Helge, could you perhaps comment
based on your discussions with the regulator of what conditions need to be in place for
the dividend to be paid later in the year? What are we looking at? Is it ﬁnancial market? Is
it social conditions? or what is it?
Secondly, you said that you can't quantify or you don't have a speciﬁc number for the
reduction in motor frequency, but I'm assuming it's signiﬁcant, and that will also go into
Q2. Would you consider giving some of that back to the policy holders as we're starting
to see some other companies giving premium rebates, so as not to proﬁt from this
situation. And thirdly, and could you perhaps give me and apologies if you've given this,
but could you give the gross and net travel costs? So we can try and assess the impact of
the reinsurance. Thank you.

Good morning, Blair. Yes, it's right. We had -- we have had discussions with regulator. And
in that discussions, they have been -- it has been during the period until now. They have
been -- they think this is early. It's uncertain times and they can see diﬀerent kind of
scenarios going forward. And they refer to EIOPA and themselves. And it's important for
them that all ﬁnancial institutions are following this signal to postpone the dividend. But of
course, they see our strong position, solvency position, and of course, they also see that
we are in a completely diﬀerent situation compared to banks.
But I think for them it has been important that all the ﬁnancial institutions and in Norway,
Gjensidige is a major ﬁnancial institutions are following the signals, both from Europe and
local FSA at the moment. But they also said that this doesn't mean that it would be
possible to payout dividend later this year. So, they are in line with what we have been
communicating today actually, but I think it's too early, and they are -- they really stressed
the point that they expect all the ﬁnancial institutions to follow at the moment.

Q - Blair Thomson Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Can I just ask before we go into the other question, Helge? Do you think that stance is
damaging to the industry, given that you've got a strong solvency and I think there was 10
years of work went into the solvency II regime, your ratio is sitting 2 or even 3 times higher
than the minimum level what relevance does that have if as soon as something bad
happens, I don't wish to trivialize the conditions, the regulator step in and just tell
everyone they can't pay a dividend. Is that damaging?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Let me comment that in this way. We -- from a company point of view, we really think we
are in a very strong position. And if it's isolated from the Gjensidige point of view, it would
have been absolutely right to payout dividend now. But as you know and you have seen
both European regulator and national regulators all over Europe, they have more or less
have the same attitude to when it comes to dividends. More strongly communicated
when it's about regarding banks, but also when it comes to non-life and life. So and as
you know we are a very large institution in Norway. So we think it's smart and right to
follow that stance from the regulator. But I don't think I will -- it's a unique situation
actually. So I think I will say that this is a unique situation. We have seen the same attitude
from regulators all over Europe, and we will follow that as a large institution and large
brand name in Norway.

Q - Blair Thomson Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Understood. Thank you.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Yes. And the second question about -- as already answered, we're not disclosing the exact
eﬀect of the motor claims and it would actually be much of a theoretical exercise to
distinguish the eﬀects from various quarters, including the good weather situation and the
low winter-related claims in the ﬁrst quarter from other eﬀects. And as already mentioned,

we do believe that there will be a positive eﬀect on the claims development going
forward on the private cars, but we're not disclosing any speciﬁc numbers on that one.
There hasn't been a debate in Norway regarding whether this would lead to premium
rebates, but we do in our conversations with the customers, advise them to both the
possibility of reducing the mileage that they pay for, which is a possibility which is of
course will reduce premiums going forward, but nothing backdated so that they would
get premiums back from what has actually already happened.
The gross travel claims, sorry, we don't disclose single events or claims like that. You will
get an indication from the income statement survey on a total level disclosed reinsurers'
share of the claims in the accounts, if you look at the income statement for the parent
company.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Johan Strom

{BIO 17541253 <GO>}

Thank you. Quick question on the interruption situation. Do you have any business
interruption coverage? Is this a standalone product that you're oﬀering? I think in general,
is this something that could drive up future claims? And if you have this, what are the
dynamics that could trade good claims for this? That is my ﬁrst question.
And secondly, going back to the comments on the solvency ratio and the increase of the
capital position. If I look at Slide number 14, did I understand this correct that the derisking of the investment portfolio reduced SCR by about NOK1 billion? And if that was
the case, when did you start to de-risk the portfolio? Thank you.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

We do not have any business interruption coverage covering this situation Johan. So
that's not the issue actually.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Business interruption claims are related to physical damage, not pandemics. So it could
be an increase in the cost of the business interruption, if it somehow delays ﬁxing the
situation, but it needs to be triggered by a physical event.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

I'll try to ﬁnd the ﬁgure, as we talk, I think we have it in the appendix of the presentation.
There is -- if you look at the capital requirement per risk fact in the appendix, I think it's -yes, 35. You see that the capital charge -- I don't have this comparison with the last
quarter. But it is somewhat less than NOK1 billion, if I remember correctly from -- market
risk has gone down, but there are, of course combination eﬀect. The balance sheet is
somewhat larger, and then the de-risked move from equities and credit towards more of a
ﬁxed income with low credit charges in the portfolio. We did the de risking during the
quarter, without being more speciﬁc than that.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Good Morning. Jan Gjerland from ABG. I have some couple of questions. The ﬁrst one
relate to the private portfolio. You said, you moved some portfolio from Norway to
Denmark. Could you elaborate on how that has moved to the proﬁtability between those
two portfolios or divisions during the quarter? And have you restated your previously
numbers? Or is it just these numbers that we should look at?
Secondly, the dividend postponement. Does that hit your customer dividend? Or is the
Gjensidige just prepared to pay-out the 12% to 14% premium discount to the customers is
bringing us normal? And ﬁnally, you say this is a physical event that need to be triggered,
but this is (inaudible) is physical, but they secure and their employees or the customers
and what of course the buildings and equipment. So is it so that its only equipments and
buildings that is sort of insured and not the thought of a business interruptions? Just to
understand that a little bit better? Thank you.

FINAL

I can start with the dividend question, and then Jostein will follow-up. The postpone of the
ordinary dividend, I would say it in this way. The Gjensidige Foundation is as eager as we
are to payout customer dividend. So ordinary dividend will then contribute and give
customer dividend, and really hope that we can pay this dividend later this year. And the
foundation is as eager as we are.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Yes. Then --

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

So they don't have cash to support it so to speak, so you didn't mean the dividend, the
NOK 7 dividend to payout this -- back to the customers?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

No. As you know, it's fully distributed, ordinary dividend is fully distributed to the
customers in Norway. So when we -- when the Board decides to payout ordinary
dividends, the Foundation will then payout that dividend to their customer -- to their
members which is customer dividends. So it's --

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay. Should they need to wait for the ordinary dividends.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Yeah, Jan Erik, they will do that.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Yeah. The bit technical question on the movement of our portfolio, it's a rather small
portfolio of product related insurance which we're handling one agreement in Norway,
although it was partly Danish business and partly Norwegian business. Last year we split
that so the Danish part of it is now recorded in the Danish segment. And the comparable
ﬁgures are not changed, so it's just that this year's ﬁgures are changed that's why we need
to give an explanation of how the growth would have been if it had been like this last year
as well, it had an eﬀect of 0.4%. I think it was on the private growth.
It is a special situation was that due to adjustment premiums that small portfolio had a
negative premium in the ﬁrst quarter of 2019. So it has a bit an obvious eﬀect on the
growth ﬁgures. I'm sure it's very technical.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

So negative growth in '19 and then positive now in '20?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Negative premium in '19, the adjustment premiums, that's why the growth ﬁgure is a bit
strange.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Yeah.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Could you then explain very strong proﬁtability growth in Denmark than relative more
since this portfolio continue to have that kind of magnitude?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. I think, we -- if you look at the local currency growth ﬁgures, I think they were
around 12%, 12.5%. But if you take out the main reason is of course that discontinuation of
a quota share reinsurance agreement. A quota share reinsurance typically carries with it a
reinsurance premium provision, which is a negative cost to us. And when that quota share
reinsurance agreement is terminated, it was there in 2019, but not this year, then the costs
go up. So that's the main reason. And if you also adjust for the small portfolio we talked
about, it's 7.9% underlying growth in Denmark, which is still quite good.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

So the closed quota share in Denmark has been taken down, because you're now more
certain about the risks. So how should we treat it going into 2020 and so this has done an
impact on the whole of 2020 for Denmark?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

It was discontinued in the second half of 2019. So, it will not have the full-year eﬀect.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Yeah. But it will have still some eﬀect.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay. So just ﬁrst half.

Yeah. Then you had a question about business interruption.

FINAL

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

The fact it's physical or even though it's a (inaudible) human beings have not been sort of
-- and it stays on for a while on the physical participants as well. So could you be sued in
court not to give any interruption insurance because it does not interrupt any physical
events, but it has, to some extent.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

I guess we could be sued for anything but our interpretation of our terms is crystal clear.
Pandemics is speciﬁcally excluded from a business interruption coverage in Norway. So
it's has to be that there is a ﬁre which leads to a business interruption loss. And the only
eﬀect of the pandemic would then be that the length of the -- of getting operations
started again somehow were aﬀected by the pandemic situation, but there will be no
business interruption of directly related to the pandemic.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

So it just continue for year that just said it was per year. We just talk, how large part of that
would be in your business? It was just be for commercials and it was just be a portion of
the commercial business that will be aﬀected on this claims?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

I would say that added Jan Erik that also our business interruption policies are usually
dated, so it's not forever.

We will take our next question from Hakon Hansen from DNB Markets. Please go ahead.

Q - Hakon Hansen

{BIO 20643844 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. One question from me as well on dividend. So do you need an oﬃcial
all clear from the FSA in order to payout the dividend for 2019, or just given, for instance,
that the situation improves but the stance from FSA is does not change can it be a

Page 17 of 23



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2020-04-22

possible for you to challenge that decision? Or do you think you've some more to
challenge FSA's current stance?

FINAL

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

I think, as Helge mentioned, I mean, this is the decision to withdraw the dividend at this
point of time is purely related to kind of overall societal issues and discussions with the
regulator, they're not regulator. There is nothing in our business or forecast or anything
that should pose any threat to the dividend. Usually, so that if you pay less than 100% of
the annual results as dividends, there is no need to apply to the FSA. But the FSA has
always the opportunity to go in and somehow overthrow the dividend decision
afterwards. But there needs to be some reason -- speciﬁc reason for it. Yeah. I think I'll
stop there.

Q - Hakon Hansen

{BIO 20643844 <GO>}

Perfect. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up question. So in the past, you all have a very
meaningful capital to pursue M&A opportunities. Given the current say uncertain situation
with ﬁnancial turmoil et cetera, could it be more interesting for you to have a big M&A
buﬀer now as well because interesting opportunities may arise, et cetera?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

No, Hakon. I think I said that earlier when we were together, the strategy is unchanged.
The dividend policy is unchanged, our M&A appetite is unchanged. So we are in a unique
situation now. So we are not planning for more, I would say, M&A appetite versus last
year, something can arise. Of course, in the marketplace, it could be some stressful
situations and we have been very strong previously and we are strong now and we can act
upon of the possibilities. But we do not discuss M&A and ﬁre power in connection with
our discussions these days. We want to pay out dividend according to our dividend policy
as soon as possible and we will do that.

Q - Hakon Hansen

{BIO 20643844 <GO>}

We will now take our next question from Daniel Kloud from Citi. Please go ahead.

Q - Daniel Kloud
Good morning, everyone. Just going back to the dividends. I mean, hypothetically
assuming that the withdrawn dividend today is postponed completely for this year. Is
there still a possibility for it to be paid out next year along with the 2020 dividend or are
there any constraints there?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

Page 18 of 23



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity
Date: 2020-04-22

FINAL

I'm still hope to pay it out and intend to pay it out this year, but if that somehow were
prohibited which I guess would have to be something related to the regulatory authorities
and not our own business. Then of course next year's dividend decision will be based on
the capital situation and the regulatory stance next year. I don't know if I can be more
precise than that. As I've already mentioned there is regulation that if you pay out more
than annual result, then that needs to be applied for, but the criteria term to evaluate that
application against would be still the solvency situation now and going forward.

Q - Daniel Kloud
Okay. Thank you. And my next question is just on the coronavirus impact, so I think there
was a few discussion around the motor claims today, but could you maybe give a bit of
color in terms of what you're seeing in other key lines, so maybe perhaps in like property
and accident? I mean, I appreciate that you don't go into the numbers, but maybe some
ﬂavor of what you're seeing there?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Yeah. I think, there is a very limited eﬀect on other -- of the business lines, and small
positive eﬀect in accident and health, but that's not to a large extent. It's related to that
operations might be postponed on some because of kind of reserving capacity in the
health system for COVID related diseases, but otherwise, you don't see any not a large -not a signiﬁcant eﬀect, even, I would say on other lines of business.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

I think, in general, this situation started mid-March and we are still in the situation with
partly lockdown of the society both in Norway and Denmark. And lockdown and partly
lockdown and as long as we are under a regime with national advice from the national
authorities, it will aﬀect the speed, dynamic and claims frequency in the society in one
way or another. It'll be limited related to property, more related to motor and personal
lines.

Q - Daniel Kloud
And could you maybe also talk a bit about the business interruption coverage that you
have in Denmark and Sweden?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Yeah. Denmark has same situation as in Norway. It's -- and Sweden is -- I mean our
portfolio is really very small there. So it's not much -- it's a similar situation as in Norway
really. Yes. I don't (Multiple Speakers)

Q - Daniel Kloud
Thank you. Just one last question, please. So it seems that key element of the growth
we've seen today, is the pricing measures that you have implemented across the region
especially in commercial lines. So I'm just keen to get your thoughts on pushing through
with the same intensity of price increases in the face of recession. I would imagine there'll

Page 19 of 23



Company Name: Gjensidige Forsikring ASA
Company Ticker: GJF NO Equity

be some kind of resistance or perhaps change in the attitudes of acceptance which
maybe share a few thoughts on that. Thank you.

FINAL

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

So I think, I mean, in the commercial side, more or less 40% of the book had their annual
renewal in January 1st. So that's kind of behind us. Next kind of above average renewal is
July 1st. We tend to price on average, I guess, in line with expected claims inﬂation. So if
the situation reduces expected claims inﬂation, that will also probably aﬀect our pricing as
well. And the second factor is of course the competitive situation where somehow
someone will use this opportunity. If you can call that to reduce prices, to increase market
share, I don't have -- we haven't seen any signals that that could happen, but there's
always the possibility.

Q - Daniel Kloud
Okay. Thank you very much.

{BIO 19956412 <GO>}

Hi, Helge. Hi, Jostein. Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up and apologies if
you've already covered this, but I missed a little bit, just on your proﬁtability in private
property lines, are you still seeing any need to sort of increase prices there or is the claims
inﬂation level quite stable, and you're quite comfortable with your proﬁtability there now?
And then also maybe just a ﬂavor on how you think about your proﬁtability in private
property in relative to that of motor at the moment?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Can you repeat the latter, please, the proﬁtability --

Q - Alexander Evans

Yes. Just about -- yes, say the proﬁtability in private property relative -- yes relative to that
of motor?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Just to start with the ﬁrst quarter, it's -- I would say it's limited
aﬀected by the COVID-19 situation that came mid-March. But the ﬁrst quarter, we are
really proud actually because we have strong growth now both in private and commercial
in Norway. And to start with the private business, we are really back on track on motor
insurance. And we do not believe that the total market is back on track. So this has been
as you know a journey in the last one-and-a-half, two years.

FINAL

So we are really pleased with the proﬁtability level. We have strong competitive position,
the retention level is strong, and we will price in line with claims inﬂation for motor
insurance going forward. We will price somewhat above claims inﬂation for private
property, because we need to strengthen the proﬁtability for private property a bit going
forward. But the situation we are in and if you look away from the COVID-19 situation, it's a
very strong position in the private business in Norway.
When it comes to commercial business, we will -- we have to price and I said that during
my presentation, we have to increase prices for some large corporates. We still have
pockets and segments. But we are really proud also the strength, the retention, the
growth in the commercial line. So we are in a very good position compared to the last
two, three years actually. So --

Q - Alexander Evans

{BIO 19956412 <GO>}

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

The issues are -- I mean, we do see an underlying or if we look at kind of excluding runoﬀs
since on improvement, but the issue is a bit the same. We haven't reached the proﬁtability
level that we think is where it should be in Sweden. So we still need to price above
expected claims inﬂation there and reduce costs further at this
kind of -- the medicine we are pattering for the Swedish segment, and although, we could
kind of combined of 94th of this quarters, is this a bit ﬂattening because there are runoﬀ
eﬀects there. So yes, more need of a prices increase in the commercial lines in Sweden
than in the private lines. I think that's the sense of it.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Thank you. Just following up on Alex's last questions here about the competition
situation. You mentioned that you have been happy with the Norwegian private situation,
especially on motor. How do you see the competitive environment around the needs to
clients from your -- - changed this space? And which kind of lines in the commercial side
or large corporate do you need to price up? If you could be a little bit more speciﬁc when
it comes to lack of proﬁtability? Thank you.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. When it comes to lack of proﬁtability, it's some pockets related to motor, large ﬂeets,
and it's also related to some property portfolios. That's ﬁrst and foremost. These 2 areas
where we had some pocket, some customers, some large customers, and we have to
increase prices to meet proﬁtability levels. But as you can see Jan Erik, the overall
situation is quite strong actually.
The ﬁrst question was related to Tryg and Vito, yes, we still see that Tryg takes when we
look at the competitive environment, it's Tryg, it's -- if it's not Fremtind that much. I think
they have much to do internally maybe and we still see that Tryg takes some customers
under the NITO agreement. But it's manageable. So the situation now is that when we
look at the private segment ﬁrst quarter it's ﬁrst and foremost price driven, the volume is
stable, and we can see that our competitiveness during the quarter is increasing day-afterday. And when it comes to the commercial business, it's both price and volume driven. So
we are in a good situation also looking forward actually for both segments.
