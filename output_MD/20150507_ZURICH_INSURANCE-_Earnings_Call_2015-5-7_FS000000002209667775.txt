FINAL

Thanks, James, and good afternoon or good morning to everyone on the phone. To just
begin with, overall business operating proﬁt for the group was $1.3 billion in the ﬁrst
quarter, and net income total for shareholders is $1.2 billion. Both numbers are about 5%
lower than in the prior-year period.
As you all know, currency has been a signiﬁcant feature of the ﬁrst quarter, and it's likely to
continue to be a feature over the course of this year. Currency is mainly a translational
issue for us because we typically match the local currency liabilities and assets, and on a
constant currency basis, both would have been broadly ﬂat, and the 5% decline in gross
premium written we've announced in GI would have been a 5% increase.
From an operating performance perspective, we see this as a solid start to the year, both
in terms of top line and BOP, albeit with results for both Q1 and the prior period
beneﬁting from a very low level of catastrophes and we have a number of positive one-oﬀ
items in both.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let me turn to one other topic before I start the Q&A. With respect to solvency, you've
seen that both Z-ECM and SST ratios have declined in the second half of last year. Z-ECM
ratio reduced from 126% at the half year to 122% at the end of the year, and SST declined
from 215% to 196% over the same period.
There are three moving parts. So the ﬁrst, impact of net market movements is mainly
ﬂatter and lower yield curve, which reduced Z-ECM by around 6% and SST by around 13%.
It's not all yield, but most of it is. Second, allowing for the expected growth that we expect
to see in the business in 2014 (sic) [2015] (02:52) sort of negative 4-point impact on Z-ECM
and a negative 5-point on SST. And then, thirdly, for Z-ECM only, these factors were
partially oﬀset by a change on how we model certain investment risks. This had a beneﬁt
of around 6 percentage points.
The interest rate sensitivity that you see and the capital ﬁgures that we disclosed today is
greater than the previously disclosed simple parallel shift that we've given for two
reasons. First and most important, is convexity and positioning. And the second is the
second and third dollar eﬀects that interest rates have on risk capital but now has
particularly pronounced impact on SST.
Looking into the development since the end of last year, we'd expect to see the Z-ECM
ratio move lower in Q1 given the combined impact of currency movements, and the
further ﬂattening and declines in bond yields amongst other factors. And our best
estimate is that we'll see a ratio in the upper half of our target range. In other words, still a
very comfortable level. And given the levers that we have at our disposal to manage the
overall risks, this does not impact our view of the deployable capital that we hold.
With that, we'll open up for Q&A.

FINAL

The ﬁrst question is from Michael Huttner, JPMorgan. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 21417183 <GO>}

Hello. Actually, thank you very much. Two questions. And I must say, I actually thought
these were really good results. But within that because you've beaten a number of my
estimates, where is – you have this target range for return on equity of 12% to 14%. You
reported 12.9%, which is excellent, excluding one-oﬀ, 11.2%. So my two questions which
are both on these. Which from your point of view, is actually the right ﬁgure, is it the
reported or the adjusted? And where is the main miss coming from, is it still in Life or
we're seeing a bit of a drift also in non-Life now? Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Is that both of your questions, Michael?

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 21417183 <GO>}

That's it. Yeah.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Okay. So which is right? I mean, obviously, they're both right because they're both
calculations. One is the headline number. But I think the more meaningful one is the
underlying ROE performance because that gives you a better sense of what you could
expect from a go-forward. And of course that's particularly relevant for the remainder of
this year, and next year to make sure that we're in that 12% to 14% ROE range. If you look
at the driver of kind of why we're not where we expect to be, I think there are probably
two key pieces, I mean, one is the same thing that you have from us at the end of last year.
So it's mainly GI. If you look at the GI combined ratio, if we adjust for CAT except for oneoﬀ expense on both sides, I mean, the underlying ex-CAT combined ratio hasn't changed
by much, in fact it's almost exactly the same.
If we drill into – we have a small improvement in attritional which we believe is oﬀset by
large loss, but of course the large loss pieces and estimate rather than (06:34). Overall
though, we need about 2-point to 3-point improvement over where we ended last year
on GI. We really made a relatively small step in the right direction, so we need much more
from GI to be in that 12% to 14% range. Second is capital. We're still carrying more capital
than we need, obviously, depresses the overall ROE. And as we've highlighted before,
and I guess we'll discuss during the course of this call, certainly we'll discuss again on May
21. Capital deployment also has the ﬁgure and is achieving that 12% to 14% ROE.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 21417183 <GO>}

And that's perfect. Thank you so much.

FINAL

Your next question is from Andrew Ritchie, Autonomous. Please go ahead.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

Well, hi there. One straightforward question, the large loss noise you alluded to in Q1, is
that still the same area generating large losses – that generated large losses in Q4, which I
think was things like, for example, U.S. commercial auto, Brazilian surety or is it new areas?
And maybe just give us a sense, is that revealing any issues or is it genuinely random. And
then, on capital; you said in your opening comments, maybe I misheard you, that there
was an eﬀect in the required capital for 2014 growth. But I thought the Z-ECM and SST
took into account anticipated organic growth for 2015, so it's forward-looking in its
requirements. Maybe if you just clarify that. And if that is the case, what level of organic
growth is kind of penciled into that number? And is that one of the levers, I guess, the
ﬁnancing of that future growth that when you talk about levers and things you can pull?
Thanks.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So on the second one, ﬁrst. Sorry, I misspoke, it's absolute 2015. Thank you for that. I
guess, as one of the levers – I guess, levers (08:41) I guess, it's a margin of prudence that
we have in the calculation. We've got about negative 4 points and negative 5 points on ZECM and SST. I apologize, I don't really want to give you a forecast of volumes for the
year, but even with the growth that we see in Q1, we're well beneath the level of growth
that we had planned for, and (09:04) capital calculations that you see. So we'd have a
signiﬁcant reduction in both 4 points and 5 points if the current trend continued through
the remainder of the year.
On the large loss theme, I'm not sure whether it's good news or bad news, but they are
completely diﬀerent from Q4. We have a large corporate loss in North America. It's by far
the largest single loss in the quarter. And we have some large losses in Europe, and in
particular, the municipal business in the UK stands out as the source of two of them. So
they're completely diﬀerent from what you saw last year.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

The issues that cropped up in Q4, are these calmed down, any development on them, or
have they just not really come across your desk in Q1?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

If you look at large losses overall, it's actually a touch higher than it was in Q4. But the
theme – I guess, there are no themes in large losses are there, but the large losses that
have occurred, you don't see the Brazilian topic crop up again, and the other items you

Page 4 of 17

saw – I mean, even then looked as though they were one-oﬀs. And so the themes in Q1
are completely diﬀerently than the large loss theme.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Thanks.

Next question is from Andrew Broadﬁeld, Barclays. Please go ahead.

Q - Andy D. Broadﬁeld

{BIO 7273415 <GO>}

Hi there. Good afternoon. Two questions. First one, on the need for capital, for the
growth, you mentioned just now that you – that Q1 have missed what you had hoped to
achieve and therefore to consume. Can you just give us a little bit of outline on where that
– why you failed to reach that growth target, what part of the business it was in and where
you think you might be able to catch back up over the course of the year? And then the
second question is also in relation to solvency. But in terms of what you anticipate, you've
talked about levers. Does it take into account things like the sort of steady decline in
Farmers Re, quota share, et cetera, that although, I know it's not in stone your intention I
see (11:14) the surplus improved again in the quarter at Farmers. So does it capture those
sorts of actions within your plan?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So Andy, on the ﬁrst one, I mean, all I can say in response to that, I mean, it's broadly
across GI. If you look at GI in Q1, we've got pretty strong growth on global corporate that
we actually think the headline there tends to overstate the growth that we expect to see
from global corporate for the year. I mean, rate is generally still modestly positive. It
continues the trend that we've seen through the course of last year, even if the absolute
numbers by the various businesses or territories move around. I mean where can we catch
up? I mean, I don't know yet. I mean, we're obviously looking to same sources of
proﬁtable growth, and we've allowed for that in the capital requirements that we forecast
for the year. I think it's too early to be clear that we will or won't achieve that, albeit, we're
behind already in Q1.
On the solvency side, the anticipated levers, I mean Farmers Re is – I mean, I guess it's not
a lever currently because it's – I mean, we'll have the reduction already baked into the new
ﬁgures for this year which are the beneﬁt of the – the immediate beneﬁt of the piece that's
reinsured into ZIBB or Zurich Bermuda Branch. I mean the levers, I was thinking of are
more of a combination of our ability to manage the required capital on the risk side
because of the choices that we take. I mean, we allocate that capital. I mean, there's no
surprise that the main consumer of capital requirement is market risk, I mean that's
something that the ﬁrm can choose to have more of or less of as it sees ﬁt. On the
available sides, it's obviously a bit slightly trickier to manage it. We can manage capital
structure which can be helpful, but mainly on the available side, it'll be the outcome of the
year in terms of our ﬁnancial performance and the impact of ﬁnancial markets on the
overall equity position that we have. The levers, for me, and we're obviously focused on

Page 5 of 17

Date: 2015-05-07

the risk-based capital requirements and what we can do there to inﬂuence capital
consumption.

FINAL

Q - Andy D. Broadﬁeld

{BIO 7273415 <GO>}

So is it fair to assume that you make no assumptions around reduction in capital needs
because of the natural one-oﬀ or changes that we anticipate – as a market, I guess, we're
expecting of Farmers Re and other areas?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

No.

Q - Andy D. Broadﬁeld

{BIO 7273415 <GO>}

Okay. All right. Thank you.

The next question is from Paul De'Ath, RBC. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Paul C. De'Ath
Yeah. Hi there and a couple of questions on the Life performance, and on Latin America
basically there you've had obviously good performance in the Santander JV, but slightly
disappointing in the Zurich branded vehicles in Latin America. And what was the driver
there? Is that kind of an active choice to favor the Santander JV or is there something else
going on there? That's question one. And secondly, I'm just looking at the ﬂow, the net
ﬂows in the Life business, the European ﬂows, I think very strong in the quarter compared
to prior years, and what was kind of the key drivers behind that? Is that the Corporate Life
and Pensions business in the UK, and how much of that is coming from winning new
schemes and how much is from sort of general auto (15:01) enrollment type growth?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thanks, Paul. So ﬁrst of all on the late performance in Latin America, it's not that we prefer
the joint venture. But we have one particular large contract that we haven't rewritten this
year, so that's largely why you're seeing the underperformance on the, I guess, the Zurich
brand an element of Latin America. Having said that, of course, the – I guess, the contract
is sharper because of the very strong performance of the JV has produced very, very
strong growth in Q1. On the net ﬂows in Europe, I guess, the two or three main drivers of –
I mean, as you hint, CLP in the UK as a piece of that, it's a combination of both new
schemes and continued enrollment. And also new product in Germany, so we have a new
product that we distribute through bancassurance partner and that also had a positive
impact on ﬂows rather than (15:59) Q1.

Q - Paul C. De'Ath
Is that a unit-linked type product or is it protection or what?

I guess, we would describe it as a hybrid product. I mean, if you look at our product mix,
we don't sell signiﬁcant volumes with guarantees. But typically many of the products have
guaranteed elements, and this is a new product with a guaranteed element rather than an
overall guarantee.

Q - Paul C. De'Ath
Great.

Operator
The next question is from Stefan Schürmann, Bank Vontobel. Please go ahead.

Q - Stefan Schürmann
Yes. Good afternoon. Two questions. The ﬁrst one, still on the Life part, you show basically
new business margins down in so-called other retail, which I think it's mostly down due to
the traditional agent business in Germany and Switzerland. I mean, can you – maybe can
we expect that to stabilize or do we take any corrective action here like cut in commission
or will that continue? And then the second one on the Farmers surplus ratio, that's
standing at 39%, and you guide towards a decrease to 33% to 36% in the near future. So I
mean, I'm not quite sure to understand why that should drop there.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Okay. So Stefan, on the ﬁrst one, you're right, it's mainly Germany and Switzerland, and
it's the impact of rates on the business there. I think, in the short term, I don't expect it to
stabilize. So I think you'll see a further reduction in new business values given the further
reduction we saw in rates in Q1 for both of those markets.

Q - Stefan Schürmann
I mean, volumes basically are up, new business volumes are up and margins are down. So
you just continue like that, or you don't take any corrective action there?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So two things. So I guess we do take corrective actions. So I mean, if you look at where we
sit in the league table on certain key measures such as bonus, we're not at the top end by
far. I mean it's too early to determine what the outcomes for this year will be. But I mean
that's one of the levers that we have to signiﬁcantly impact the overall ﬁnancial
performance. And there has to be a close correlation between what we're earning on the
portfolio and what we share with the policyholder. So I mean that's one of the key levers
for us.
I think – I mean just to be clear, on new business value, you could optimize purely for new
business value and I think you'd end up with potentially an even more negative outcome.
So we try and look at both new business value and BOP when we try to make decisions of

Page 7 of 17

Date: 2015-05-07

FINAL

where we would prioritize growth. I mean, Germany (18:30) it's very diﬃcult though
because of where interest rates are.
On surplus, for Farmers, so the key reason you haven't seen it fall straight back into the
target range it's because of where the calculation is done. The calculation is based on net
written. So essentially as they recapture the reinsurance, you'll see a bit more streams, a
few more quarters come by and that will cause all things being equal. And dependent on
earnings at the exchanges, the surplus ratio to fall and we would expect to see it – again
depending on the actual ﬁnancial performance fall back into the exchange's target range.

Q - Stefan Schürmann
Okay. Thanks.

The next question is from Nick Holmes, Société Générale. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 21515144 <GO>}

Hi there. Thank you very much. Two questions. First is on the GI expense ratio, just
wondered if you could share with us how you see the Q1 result developing throughout
the year. I was really thinking, I guess the upfront distribution costs that have taking us up
to 31%. Are they going to continue, and is 31% the sort of number that you would expect
to see? And then second question is on U.S commercial pricing. Just wondered, again,
how you see this developing. I mean, 2% rate change seems pretty good result. Does this
sum, do you think, throw doubt out on what market scouts have been saying about the
appearance of a soft market? Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thank you. So on the ﬁrst one, on the GI expense ratio, I mean what you see for this
quarter, I mean before we take action on the eﬃciency side is pretty much what you'd
expect. So there's no reason why, for example, the impact of the distribution even would
increase or decrease through the course of the year. But having said that, I mean, I guess
we've made it clear at the year-end, and we're working on it currently, that the expense
ratio that we see is too high. And as a topic, we'll speciﬁcally address when we have the
investor updates on May 21. So I mean for the time being, based on what you see
currently, the current level is reasonably indicative of what you would expect, but we have
intentions to bring that number down.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 21515144 <GO>}

Right. And sorry, can I just ask, would that be for this year, or is that sort of looking out
over the medium term, sort of two years, three years, or perhaps you prefer to wait until
the Investor Day to tell us?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Well, I guess the one thing I will say, Nick, is that medium term would be too long...

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 21515144 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

On U.S. commercial pricing, I guess the challenge is that it's bumped around a bit, if you
look at our rate monitor. I'm not sure I would describe it as a particularly positive
environment. I mean, we've been in position in the U.S. for some time now where the rate
change is, I mean, roughly in line with loss cost inﬂation. I mean, Q1, I think we've seen the
market respond to some of the challenges that were evident from a number of companies
including ours in Q4, for example in commercial auto. So you've seen a number of areas
where rate entries have been pushed through. But if you look at the market overall, it was
down in the position where rate is covering what we think loss cost is increasing by, which
means that margin is not currently expanding. And also, if you look at the individual lanes,
I mean, property still has pressures. I mean, that story hasn't changed recently, and also
workers' comp has a bit of pressure currently. So I mean, while I don't think it's clearly
(22:41) negative. I think I mentioned on the full-year call that – I didn't share markets goes
(22:47) more negative outlook for the full year. But we certainly haven't turned any corners
on the U.S. pricing environment and, to be honest, I don't expect to see that take place
over the course of this year. I think we'll see continued pressure.

Q - Nick Holmes

The next question is from Farooq Hanif, Citigroup. Please go ahead.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi. Thank you very much. I apologize if this question has been asked. I was a little late at
the beginning of the call. But looking at your Z-ECM ratio, I mean, you made the comment
obviously that Q1 has been tough because of interest rates, and obviously that's reversed
quite strongly in Q2. So presumably, if this is maintained in the current environment, then
you will recover back up to the upper end of your coverage or above the upper end.
That's one question. And then secondly, you have this kind of 4 points of business proﬁt is
uplifting your Z-ECM ratio. Is that – can we just sort of normalize that for the year and
presume that you'll grow pre-dividend 8 points a year in that Z-ECM ratio. Is that kind of
Page 9 of 17

decent rule of thumb? And lastly, in Global Life, you've mentioned that going to the €350
million, or above the €350 million was hard because of FX. Now, has that got worse or
better based on movements to-date? Thank you.

FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thanks, Farooq. So I mean, ﬁrst on Z-ECM, I mean, the only comment I've provided
through the end of the quarter, and I've commented on the fact that, I mean, given the
continuing move on yield curves, we expected to see Z-ECM come down and we expect
to be in the upper half of our range. And we still believe we're in a comfortable position
because of the extent to which we can control our capital consumption. I'm going to
avoid commenting on what's happened post the end of the quarter. I mean, I guess, I may
mention that when we come back on the Investor Day. I mean, interest rates, as they rise,
particularly at the long end, particularly in some of the European markets, certainly, would
be helpful. I mean, I think we're going to a relatively volatile period for a time. So it will go
up and down a bit. But I think the good news, certainly from our perspective, is that we
have enough ﬂexibility to manage.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the business proﬁt piece, the – I'm not sure exactly which – I guess, if you're looking at
the waterfall chart, you need to be a wee bit careful that you got the business proﬁt on
one side and then you got dividend on the other. I mean, given the payout ratios, you
tend to ﬁnd that – I mean, we've paid back to our shareholders a very large proportion of
the economic proﬁt that we generate. So I mean, if it's 4.5 points and we have an accrual
of say 3 points within the 5 points that we've disclosed, for dividend, I mean it tends to be
a relatively modest addition to the overall capital base because we're handing it back.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Okay.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

On the GL topic, maybe to give GL that credit for what they have achieved. I think if we
had stuck simply to the more than $350 million a quarter based on the foreign exchange
levels when we ﬁrst announced it, we'd be there already. But having said that, I mean
when we talk about a bit more than $350 million, we actually had now made a lot more
than $350 million. I mean today – I mean, as FX moves, particularly euro weakens against
the franc given the preponderance of earnings that GL has there, it becomes tougher. But
when we looked at it earlier in the year, I mean we were just above $350 million in terms
of expectation, once all the improvements that come through from GL. But the one point
I'd like to add though, I was asked on the full year call about GI, and GI's expectation of
growing their earnings by 5% compound. And I commented there that, of course, I didn't
expect then to compensate for any possible FX movement and the same is true for GL, so
we stopped to the $350 million. It's become tougher because of foreign exchange, I
mean they've done a lot of what we'd expected of them already when we ﬁrst announced
this. But we still hold to the more than $350 million.

Q - Farooq Hanif

The next question is from James Shuck, UBS. Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Hi. Good afternoon. I have two questions, please. Apologies for returning to the Z-ECM
number, but I just wanted to pick up on something you said earlier on, George, that two
of the reasons why the ROE is not hitting your target at the moment is, on the one hand,
the GI combined ratio, but on the other hand you have more capital than you need. And
I'm just struggling to see why that's the case because you're targeting 100 to 120 (27:52)
of that ECM, and you're currently, on a Q1 basis, towards the upper-end of that range. I
appreciate you got some levers to manage, but I kind of just wanted to understand
whether you've actually got surplus capital.

Bloomberg Transcript

And that's the way I should look at it, or whether this is more a case of why we're going to
pull some of those levers and then that will release capital. And if that's the case, so I just
wanted to be clear that there's no modeling changes to the plan. It is strictly around the
required capital management. And when you consider the required capital, you're also
considering what the impact is on the potential earnings growth because obviously if you
take less market risk then the outlook for earnings will come down even if volatility is
improved. So that's my ﬁrst question.
Secondly, just around the underlying accident – or the underlying loss ratio and the exprior year. So if I look at the accident year, loss ratio improved 70 bps in Q1 year-on-year,
you had higher large losses of about 1 point and lower nat cat of about 40 basis points. So
in theory, you have about 130 basis points of underlying loss ratio improvement now, and
I was just hoping for some insight geographically where that's been coming from, please.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Okay. So let me try and do the ﬁrst one. So on the ﬁrst one, I guess we've been pretty
clear. I mean, given the target range, we try and measure ourselves oﬀ the midpoint of the
target range, so 110 (29:20). And if you think back to prior conversations about how much
capital excess we had, we would often, well, I would often talk about the fact that if we
have 16 points, 16 translates into, let's say, around $6 billion. But we don't have $6 billion
because we have a lot of constraints, and therefore we'd use the short hand of $3 billion.
And in fact, that was the basis for that, the additional step that you saw on the ROE book I
presented back in London in December.
So I mean, a part of what's happened through the second part of last year and the early
part of this year is that, I guess, the constraints have come more into line with each other. I
mean, some of the rating models don't move as rapidly. And despite of some of these
things, as the Z-ECM, in particular, the SST, so the numbers have come down, but I guess
the constraint picture has changed, if that makes any sense. So I don't see a fundamental
change in the ﬂexibility that we have. On top of that, you're right, I mean, we have the
ability to manage required capital. We need to be careful that we don't give up eﬃcient
earnings as part of that. But again a peak capital requirement is for ﬁnancial market risk – I

mean, and that's certainly something we manage actively and we have done in the past
and we'll continue to do in the future.
Would modeling changes be part of the story? (30:44) I mean, I think one of the big
diﬀerences you see between the two numbers today, between SST and Z-ECM, is that ZECM has the beneﬁt of what we think is a signiﬁcant improvement and the way that we
model market and credit risks, and the tail. I mean, I think, in due course, we'll review that
and we may propose that to the FINMA for inclusion on SST. But of course, the
acceptance of that by FINMA is purely their discretion, and I would imagine that it would
take some time from the point at which we would propose it. And we do need to manage
the gap between Z-ECM and SST. So I mean, model change couldn't be a signiﬁcant
factor.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

And just to clarify one point, any decision on capital that you may not need, either
because you can't ﬁnd sources for it, or it might make sense to return that? That
presumably would be a year-end decision.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

(31:43) yes. So I think the – I mean, we'd make it – I mean, again, going back to what I said
at the year-end, I mean, broadly (31:53). So as we come up to the year-end, we make any
decisions there. But what we see in terms of the inorganic or organic opportunities ahead
of us versus return to shareholders. So I mean, in the early part of 2016 is decisive for us.
Underlying loss ratio. So I didn't quite understand the work that you did. I mean, in my
head, I guess the numbers in the combined ratio were that the – if you adjust for some of
the one-oﬀ expense in the prior year, if you adjust for the cap ﬂuctuation, we're about the
same that we have a positive impact on the attritional, oﬀset by negative on the large loss.
So there's a 60-basis point, 70-basis-point improvement rather than – you mentioned 130
basis points, but you may have included some of the things I'm normalizing in my head.
I mean, the improvements we see are a combination of various items, so it's something
that we expect to drive proﬁtability over the course of this year. So portfolio management
we describe tearing (32:58), so I mean obviously emphasizing the positive parts of the
portfolio and looking for signiﬁcant rates in the weaker areas. And I mentioned
commercial auto earlier in the conversation. We've had some small steps on turnaround,
so obviously Russia, from a loss perspective is no longer in the picture. South Africa is
slightly better, albeit Brazil is probably slightly worse than it was before. But I mean, those
drivers are mainly the drivers of what we perceive the attritional loss ratio improvement to
be in Q1.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

And North America commercial, how's the attritional loss ratio developed there at Q1?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Well, I mean, overall North America commercial has improved, I mean, both from
underlying attritional and from PYD perspective. So results in North America commercial

The next question is from Thomas Seidl, Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you. Good day, everyone. Two questions. Number one on the investment income
side, we calculated you had a sharp drop year-on-year in regular investment income of 38
basis points. And I wonder although in the context of total risk adjusted costs (34:30),
should we now expect Zurich to re-risk to mitigate a further sharp drop in the investment
income or should we actually expect Zurich to derisk in order to get more room to
maneuver in the capital side and mostly about that.
And the second question on the capital, I think they (34:54) of course but in the end
would have been $116 million. The model change is not as you said available in SST, but
from an outside perspective as we've seen a clear or robust metric. If I extrapolate the ZECM number you gave for Q1, I would say that SST is probably around (35:13) now after
Q1, and I wonder if you ever have a threshold for this (35:21) metrics. So how low would
you be willing to go in SST before it gets painful?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So let me start with the ﬁrst one. Again, going back to the full year, we indicated that we
had decided that we would change asset allocation in a couple of areas, and that was
predominantly in equities. So we've given Cecilia and the team a 1% shift in the equity
asset allocation, predominantly away from ﬁxed income. On top of that, the IM team
already had an existing strategy around the liquids. They've been completing that. They
haven't completed it yet, but they will continue to do that through the course of this year.
And those two steps were really the only steps that we had planned to take on the asset
side to help mitigate the impact of negative rates in some of the countries we discussed
earlier in the call. Whether we take further steps? No, I mean, Cecilia has the ability to
tactically decide to be slightly long or slightly short depending on market circumstances.
But we have no further intension to shift the SAE (36:30).
On Z-ECM and SST, I guess you can get a sense of, I mean, where we're comfortable from
an SST perspective from where we've operated in the past. I mean 196% is still a very
strong position for the company to operate at. I'm not sure you can do what you just did
and extrapolate the things straight-line. I mean, if you look at the moves we've had both
for Q1 and some of the comments around what happened in April, May. I wouldn't get to

the same level that you've estimated. But I mean Z-ECM is where our focus is. I think the
point that you made that we need to manage the GAAP is absolutely true. We haven't set
a formal ﬂoor for SST, as we would expect over time Z-ECM and SST to remain somewhat
in some kind of harmony. But I mean, SST is not a formal part of the risk tolerance, we're
still very well capitalized under SST.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

If anything, I would have expected SST to react more strongly to the macro risks
materializing in (37:33) compared with Z-ECM, and that is also what you have seen in 2014.
Isn't it?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

I think that's what I said at the beginning of the call. So I mean, SST reacts more strongly, I
mean, principally because things like market value margins and the way that calculation is
done.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

And hence, I would have expected that the 196% you reported at the year-end after Q1 is
usually in the 180%s if you have like a 10% drop on Z-ECM after Q1 that struck my method
here, (38:04) of course, with a linear extrapolation here.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yeah. I tried to give guidance around Z-ECM because we see that as the essential capital
measure for us. I haven't given guidance around SST.

The next question is from Niccolo Dalla Palma, Exane BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.

Q - Niccolo C. Dalla Palma

{BIO 16052945 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. Just one follow-up question. On the comments you made at the
beginning of the call regarding the 2 points, 3 points combined ratio improvement
needed in GI to bring you closer to the center of the target ROE. Could you give us any
sense of how big a role expense ratio improvement compared to underlying loss ratio
improvement have to play in there, or do we have to wait a couple of weeks to get more
clarity on that? Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

I mean, we'll do much more in a couple of weeks when we have the Investor Day. I mean,
we already said that of the 2 points to 3 points improvement, broadly about one-third

from expense, almost one-third from turnarounds, and the remainder from portfolio
management. I mean, that's roughly how we expected to break that.

The next question is from Dhruv Gahlaut, HSBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Dhruv Gahlaut

{BIO 16209870 <GO>}

Good afternoon. Just two questions. Firstly, we talked about pricing in diﬀerent markets.
But if you have to look at how the rate evolution has been compared to the claims, how
would those two compare on a group level? Secondly, on the FMS business, there was
commentary in terms of an uptick in terms of the expenses. Is that one-oﬀ or is this the
number going forward?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So rate versus claims, I mean, broadly in line with each other. I mean, it varies market-tomarket, but from a group perspective, one broadly equals the other. On FMS, the
comment on expenses was due to the fact that last year we had a margin on FMS of about
7.2%. And I guess we guided that we'd be at 7% over the course of this year, next year.
And we've arrived at 7%, a bit more quickly I think than we had anticipated. That's due to
that expense feature, but I don't expect it to go further, 7% is where I expect it to be.

Q - Dhruv Gahlaut

{BIO 16209870 <GO>}

Okay. Perfect. Thanks.

We have a follow-up question from Michael Huttner, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 21417183 <GO>}

Yeah. And it is just one question, thank you very much for all the answers until now. So
Life, €350 million, you're keeping your target, that's brilliant, over €350 million. We
achieved €319 million. Which reasons or which levers or which – where do you think there
is a little bit of easy wins?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

(41:14) for describing any of what it has to do is easy wins. I mean, I think the broad
buckets, Michael, will be a combination of – I guess, what we refer to is, in-force
management as some of the more mature European markets. So that means expenses,
persistence management, those types of things. But I mean, I think on the more positive
side of it, I mean, given the growth that you've seen again from the joint venture of
Page 15 of 17

Santander in the quarter, we expect that also to be appraising as a good contributor to
the growth on the positive side of what Life is doing. I mean, those would be the two most
obvious as we expect further improvement from Life.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 21417183 <GO>}

And if I may just very brieﬂy, if you were to consider selling the remainder of your UK
business in a kind of one-oﬀ deal, closed block or whatever, what impact would that have
on your ROE metric?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So I guess, the only straight answer I can give to that, Michael, is that we don't expect to
sell the remainder of our UK Life business.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

Okay.

In general, we're looking at the entire Life bank book for opportunities to try and
optimize, to ﬁnd maybe parts of the portfolio that we ﬁnd better owners who would
perceive a higher value, and that's something we continue. I mean, our Life business in
general is actually expected to contribute, I mean, strongly positively to some of the
strategic priorities that Life has currently (42:51) particularly CLP.
