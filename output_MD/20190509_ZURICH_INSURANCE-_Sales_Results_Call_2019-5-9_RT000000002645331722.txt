Bloomberg Transcript

Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the update for the three months ended March 31,
2019 conference calls. I'm Sherry, the Chorus Call operator. I would like to remind you that
all participants will be in listen-only mode and the conference is being recorded. The
presentation will be followed by a Q&A session.
(Operator Instructions) The conference is now being recorded for publication or

Investor Relations and Rating Agency Management. Please go ahead, sir.

Richard Burden

{BIO 1809244 <GO>}

Good morning, good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to Zurich Insurance Group's
First Quarter 2019 Q&A Call.
On the call today is our group CFO, George Quinn. Before we start with the Q&A, I'd just
like to remind you please keep your questions to a maximum of two; and if we have time,
we will come back to you later on in the call. But before we start with the Q&A, George
would just make a few introductory remarks. George, over to you.

George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thanks, Richard, and good morning, and good afternoon to all of you. Thanks for joining
the Q1 call. Just a reminder before we start the Q&A, the focus obviously on Q1 and again
at Q3 this year is on revenue trends, and also as important, the commentary on the
performance of the business. You'll see the full running detail again at the half year.

Over the ﬁrst quarter, we've made a strong start to the year, and we believe that we are
fully on track to meet or exceed all of the targets for this year. The results clearly show that
the strategy is working. And while the quarter has also seen beneﬁts from the full
inclusion of the Latin American acquisitions that we announced last year, we've also
continued to strengthen our customer and partnership propositions with the group
having entered into a number of incremental distribution agreements in the year-to-date.
Perhaps most notably P&C pricing trends have continued to improve particularly in North
America and if anything have accelerated over the course of the quarter.
Rate is clearly in excess of claims cost. And the rest of the world trends have remained
broadly stable. And we have seen some strong performances particularly in our Swiss
business as well as from some of our smaller country units. In terms of nat cat and
weather, I would describe the ﬁrst quarter as relatively benign.

Bloomberg Transcript

There have been a number of weather events around the world. These have tended to
focus on areas where we are less exposed than perhaps some of our peers are, resulting
in overall cat losses that are slightly below our normal quarterly expectations. Our life
business also continued to deliver on the strategy of focusing on capital light and
protection business and this continues to support good growth, which aims to balance
return on capital, cash generation and new business margins, which as you've seen today,
remain at an attractive level. Our Swiss and Irish businesses have had a particularly strong
performance over the quarter in the Corporate Life and Pensions and segment.
Farmers continued to deliver steady performance, continued to execute on its strategy to
strengthen the agency force and customer metrics have continued to improve. The
surplus ratio has improved further and stands at the highest level for the exchange for
some time. And of course, this will support future growth of the business. The quarter also
conﬁrms our very strong capital position with a Z-ECM ratio at 125%, providing us with
continued capital ﬂexibility.
We continue to review opportunities to release capital from non-core areas of the
business and following the announced sale of the UK Employers' Liability back in
December and the more recent announcement of the transfer of our US A&E book to
Enstar In April, we've eﬀectively removed all legacy A&E exposure from the group
balance sheet. With that, I'm very happy to turn to Q&A. (Question And Answer)

Operator
We'll now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) The ﬁrst
question comes from the line of Michael Huttner, JP Morgan.
Please go ahead.

Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Good morning, good afternoon. Great results. And on the pricing, both of them, I'm not
sure which.

FINAL

I was amazed, plus 4% like-for-like growth; in terms of volume pricing, plus 2%. Is the
volume or the premium total of 4%, given that you've kind of got half -- half made us
understand it'd be ﬂat this year, a clear decision by the group saying that, yes, account
margins, yes, will open the tap and in other words will reach better than 96% by the end
of the year? And then the second question on solvency. You did say it was strong. I was
hoping that you would kind of say, "Oh yes, but we had to adjust full year and this is the
reason why.
" I just wondered whether you could explain a little bit moving parts. The 125%, which to
me is the same ﬁgure as December, obviously at 3 year it's up 1%, do you feel a strong
result hoping? I just wondered, is there something missing? I would have expected the
sale of these back books to release more capital.

George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thanks, Michael. So, on the ﬁrst question on pricing, I guess we're not open the tap kind
of people, are we? Again, we typically have a far more disciplined approach than that.

Bloomberg Transcript

I think if you look at what drives that, and I referred to some of it in the intro. I mean in
some markets, I mean we have seen stronger growth than we expected. Some of that was,
I mean, part of the direction we gave the business. Some of it is tactical just given the
market conditions.
But we certainly haven't sent a message to the business that now is the time to go all-in
across the market. And in fact, I mean last night, we briefed our leadership team call -- our
leadership team on the information we were presenting today. And one the most senior
underwriters joined the call to say that it's important that all the underwriters focus on the
trade-oﬀ between retention and price. Just given the current market conditions, you can
probably push a bit harder.
And so there isn't a volume goal out there. We haven't instructed people to grow across
the various markets. But in some places over the course of Q1, we've not only been able
to achieve the rates, which I'll come to in a second, but some of the businesses, for
example, the Swiss one have produced good growth. On the rates topics, if you allow me,
I'll make a couple of comments on that before I move to the solvency topic.
I think if -- I mean, certainly if you listen to us after the year-end on the roadshow, Mario
said that we had a pretty cautious outlook on pricing. So I mean if you have a look at what
we've seen in the ﬁrst quarter, especially in the US., I mean the headline rate is that hiring
Q1 than it was in any quarter last year were a bit over 4%. And we see the claims inﬂation
trends to be broadly consistent with the ﬁgures that we saw last year, so just in the low 2s.
So if this continues, I mean there is the potential of reasonable margin expansion. For the
beneﬁt of those of you that may try and compare the pricing numbers that we have to the
-- the ones you have got from the peer group over the course of the last few days, I mean,
the x workers' comp number would be about plus 6, just to put it in context. On the
solvency topic, I think you're completely right. I think the reason that you don't quite see

FINAL

the picture that you might have expected, I mean given the market movements from a
spread and an equity perspective, you certainly expect to see some recovery of the
change we saw in Q4.
I mean what really oﬀsets this is mainly interest rates actually. So a combination of interest
rates moves and in particular, the shape of the curve is what drives this economy, it
particularly impacts the pension funds sort of things. So now I take the point. I guess my
intro comment was more about the absolute level than the relative positioning.

Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Okay.

Next question comes from the line of Andrew Ritchie, Autonomous. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi there.
I guess one of the reasons why pricing appears to have picked up is there's greater fear
on the industry on the state of let's call it prior lost cost, not current lost cost trends,
particularly in casualty lines. I mean can you give us any sense of have you looked again
recently at what's -- in terms of developing -- in terms of underlying loss trends on your
liability reserves in particular? Have you felt the need to take any more remedial action
you've been having? You've been taking some of the good news in workers' comp and
adding to those lines. I guess I'm just trying to get some sense about the real conﬁdence
in higher prices coming through to better margin or whether they make it even up in
more conservative loss picks given the heightened uncertainty on prior year loss trends
for the industry. And secondly, could you give us a quick update in Australian life or the
OnePath deal closure? Industry trends appear to have got worse again in terms of claims
and is that going to aﬀect the likely proﬁt coming from that acquisition? Thanks.

George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thanks, Andrew. So on the drivers behind the pricing change, I mean, my gut feel is it is
more than just a fear of that prior development or even the need to have a more
conservative pick on the current accident year. I mean that may be an element although -but there's a basic proﬁtability challenge and you see it in the commercial market more
broadly last year. For us, I mean as you guys all know, even though we don't publish the
detailed results today, we run Q1 in the same way that we run any other quarter.
We've been through our normal reserve process. I think there's nothing in that, that had I
presented it today would have surprised you. The -- you referred to the fact that last year,
we had made some changes, especially in the US Where we've seen I mean fairly strong
growth reserve release around the workers' comp topic and we've recycled some of that

FINAL

into more conservative positions on for example GL That's not something that's continued
into Q1. I mean, we -- I mean, like any business we have pockets of reserves that are more
challenging.
We have other pockets that are certainly more positive. And we still see the bias as more
positive than negative in our book. And maybe just -- so on the current accident year side
of things, again, I think there, I mean, given the action that we've taken last year, we would
expect to see improvements in current action year picks, especially around the US And
again from a -- as I look out towards the end of this half when we formally report, I'm not
seeing any evidence that would lead me to expect to see something other than that at this
stage. Australian life, I saw -- I guess you guys, you've heard from the reinsurers over the
last few days and you've seen already some of the challenges in the market because of
the Royal Commissions topics.
Maybe I'll talk on industry now. I'll talk about our own business, and how that performs
and I'll touch on that closure date. So on the industry more broadly you see a number of
challenges both on growth and on DI in Australia particularly impacts the bank on sector.
So certainly impacts the business that we intend to acquire.

Bloomberg Transcript

From a Zurich perspective, I mean our business actually has been doing very well. So,
we've taken market share over this period. The business has suﬀered a bit on DI, but the
overall performance continues to be pretty strong. And in fact, the -- I mean the
Australians recently gave us an update.
And if we had been presenting the Investor Day presentation today, you would see
stronger numbers in terms of the outcome for Australia life. So I think there will be more
what to do around OnePathwhen we acquire it. That's not entirely a surprise given what
we knew was coming. But the bank sector certainly has more challenges than maybe the
other names including Zurich have currently.
On the closure, we expect it to close in Q2. So we should own this by the end of the
quarter.

Oh, hi there, thank you very much. Just one question following up really on the question
that's been asked before, but in a diﬀerent way. Do you still expect the combined ratio to
be at the upper end of the 95% to 96% target range? Or could it be better, I mean that's
basically what the numbers are suggesting? Or is it just too early to say? Thank you.

FINAL

George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yes. Thanks, Nick. That's a very good way of asking the same question. The -- I mean,
we're not changing the guidance around the combined ratio today, so we've told you to
expect that we'll see this at the upper end of the range.
I mean, we are seeing more positive signals than we expected around pricing, but not
currently changing guidance.

Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Okay. So it's too early to say?

George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

That's what I was implying.

Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, yes, lovely.
Thank you very much.

Operator
(Operator Instructions) The next question comes from the line of Vinit Malhotra,
Mediobanca. Please go ahead.

Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Hi there, hi everybody.
Just quickly maybe one question because my pricing question have been addressed. The
growth that we saw in EMEA, particularly Switzerland, you say it's Swiss commercial. Is it
the commercial, like, large commercial? Is it retail? Is it international programs? Or is it
domestic? Are you able to give us a bit of color? The reason for asking this is also again a
bit of follow-up on an earlier question from Michael that how is the growth -- how are you
thinking about your portfolio and the growth? Basically what have happened in
Switzerland commercial? Thank you.

George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG

Yes, so, today our Swiss business is -- has been focused on the larger end of commercial.

FINAL

And if I -- one of the things that the team has been doing is trying to ﬁnd ways to be a
more signiﬁcant player on SME But certainly the growth that you see in Q1 is driven by
traditional markets in Swiss commercial. I think we're hopeful that over the course of this
year, certainly next year, that we'll see the business here take up a more signiﬁcant market
position around SME But that's not what's driving it in Q1.

Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

And this was a higher combined ratio in the past in large commercial proﬁtable.

George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

No.

Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Is that one of the reasons why you are --

Bloomberg Transcript

George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

No, no. Sorry to interrupt you, Vinit, the -- so I mean -- I think you have to have it in your
mind that when you look at large commercial generally in the global business, I mean you
tend to associate it with higher combined ratios. That's not just true in the Swiss business.
The Swiss business is very attractive.
So I mean, we're delighted to see this growth here.

Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

Operator
That was the last question.

Richard Burden

{BIO 1809244 <GO>}

Thank you very much, everybody, for dialing in today. Obviously, if you do have further
questions, please don't hesitate to call any of the Investor Relations team. And with that,
thank you very much and have a good afternoon.
