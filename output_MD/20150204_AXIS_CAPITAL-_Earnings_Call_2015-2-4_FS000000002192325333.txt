{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Thanks, Rick, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us today.
Last night, AXIS reported fourth quarter operating income of $120 million or $1.18 per
diluted share and annualized operating ROE for the quarter of 9.3%. For the year, we
Page 2 of 26



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2015-02-04

FINAL

delivered an operating ROE of 10.8%. We ended the quarter and year with diluted book
value per share of $50.63, an increase of 10.5% over the last year. Adjusted for dividends,
diluted book value grew 13% over the last 12 months.
In addition, during the quarter, we returned $105 million in capital to our shareholders
through share purchases and common share dividends. And on the year-to-date basis, we
returned $661 million, thus returning to shareholders 117% of the year's operating income
in the form of dividends and share repurchases.
Over its relatively short lifespan, AXIS has delivered strong growth, taking our expertise
into new geographies, expanding our franchises into adjacent markets and even entering
wholly new specialty areas. However, not every period is conducive to such expansion,
especially in the phase of a difficult trading environment.
Gross premiums declined 8% in the fourth quarter, essentially timing differences on a
large reinsurance contract and we're flat for the full year. In many of our operations, we
focus more on consolidating our position than in continuing to expand. Still, we continue to
achieve significant growth within certain business areas, including accidents and health,
and U.S. casualty, which continues to benefit from price increases.

Bloomberg Transcript

Each of our segments performed well in this quarter and delivered solid underwriting
results, reflecting low cat activity, albeit a little bit higher than in the fourth quarter of 2013,
ongoing favorable reserve developments, and a broadly diversified, well-constructed
portfolio of risks.
While there is always some volatility in the timing and frequency of mid-size losses,
experience was close to average in the quarter. Other attritional loss experience also
improved in a number of lines. Importantly, our fourth quarter results showed meaningful
positive results from the targeted portfolio enhancements on which we worked diligently
throughout the year.
Another proud achievement was our Accident & Health unit's positive contribution to
income prior to corporate overhead. It has met our stated objective, and for the full year,
our A&H business was essentially at a breakeven, right on schedule.
Overall, we report a consolidated combined ratio of 91.5%, including 2.2 points of cats and
6.9 points of favorable prior year reserve development. This brings our consolidated
combined ratio for the year to 91.6%. Our net investment income declined 31% in the
quarter, reflecting not only persistent low interest rate environment, but also the relatively
weak equity markets in the quarter.
We've recognized that there is normal market based volatility in this line and are
comfortable that we have a high quality and balanced portfolio that is well positioned for
the uncertain investment environment.

FINAL

I'm proud of our progress and secure in our ability to succeed in a transitioning
environment. Nevertheless, we found an opportunity to further enhance our positioning.
Last week, we announced the signing of a definitive amalgamation agreement with
PartnerRe to create one of the world's preeminent specialty insurance and reinsurance
companies with gross premiums written in excess of $10 billion, total capital of more than
$14 billion, and cash and invested assets of more than $33 billion.
The completion of this merger will mark the beginning of a new and exciting chapter,
which will leverage the best of both organizations to enhance our competitive positioning
and drive significant incremental value creation across the board.
I'll discuss this more broadly after Joe's discussion of our financial results. Joe?

Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Thank you, Albert, and good morning, everyone. During the quarter, we generated good
results with an annualized operating ROE of 9.3%. Our quarterly diluted book value per
common share, a key metric in measuring the value we generate for our shareholders,
increased by 1.5% to $50.63 per share.

Bloomberg Transcript

The growth in our diluted book value per share for the full 2014 financial year was 11%.
When our dividends declared during the year of $1.10 are added to the growth in book
value, the total value created for our shareholders over the last 12 months was 13%.
Current quarter's results benefited from a strong underwriting performance from both of
our segments, driven by improvement in our loss experience most notably in the property
and professional lines and the continued favorable prior year development in our loss
reserves. These positive factors were partially offset by an increase in our general and
administrative expenses, which included approximately $6 million or $0.06 per diluted
share of incremental expenses related to our ongoing expense reduction initiatives.
In addition, we incurred a small amount of natural catastrophe and weather-related losses
compared to no losses incurred during Q4 2013. Operating income was also impacted by
a decrease in returns from our alternative investment portfolio and realized and mark-tomarket losses on our weather derivatives portfolio. Our quarterly results also included a
large increase in foreign exchange gains driven by the impact of the continued
appreciation of the U.S. dollar against our foreign denominated liabilities.
Moving into the details of the income statement, our fourth quarter gross premiums
written decreased 8% to $762 million driven by our Reinsurance segment. For our
Reinsurance segment, the fourth quarter is normally a quiet renewal period. The
Reinsurance segment top-line was down 37%, largely due to professional lines following a
change in the timing of a large quota share treaty as well as reduced treaty participations
and non-renewals.
Property lines also recorded a decrease due to premium adjustments and timing
differences. These decreases were partially offset by growth in the liability lines reflecting
Page 4 of 26



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2015-02-04

increased treaty participations and new business.

FINAL

In our Insurance segment, gross premiums were up 3% with the biggest growth noted in
the property lines due mainly to timing differences and liability lines which were driven by
new U.S. casualty business. Partially offsetting these increases was a drop in our credit and
political risk premiums reflecting variances in the flow of new business.
For the full year, our gross premiums written were flat at $4.7 billion compared to 2013. An
increase in our Reinsurance segment of 2% was significantly impacted by the level of
contracts written on a multi-year basis in the liability, property, catastrophe and motor lines
with premiums written of $131 million relating to future underwriting years.
Excluding the impact of the outer year (11:28) multi-year premiums, the Reinsurance
segment premium decreased by $80 million, primarily due to decreases in professional,
property, and catastrophe reflecting timing of a large quota share as mentioned
previously, reduced treaty participations and non-renewals. These decreases were
partially offset by growth in our liability and agriculture lines.

Bloomberg Transcript

In our Insurance segment, our top line was down 1%. The decrease was driven by our
professional lines of business due to the reshaping of our U.S. D&O portfolio during the
year and property lines which were impacted by competitive market conditions. This
decrease was partially offset primarily by growth in the U.S casualty markets reflecting
new business and rate improvements.
Our consolidated net premiums written were down 14% for the current quarter. This
reduction was driven by the overall decrease in written premium as well as the growth in
ceded premiums due to increased reinsurance protection purchased primarily in our
insurance, professional, and property lines of business and the impact of changes in the
business mix.
Our net premiums earned increased by 2% to $959 million in the fourth quarter of 2014.
Increases were noted in both segments with Insurance increasing by 3% primarily
reflecting the continued growth of our Accident & Health book while Reinsurance
increased by 1%. Our 2014 net earned premiums were $3.9 billion, a growth of 4%.
Our fourth quarter consolidated and current accident year loss ratio decreased by 1.5
points to 61.6% compared to the same period of last year. For the full year, the current
year loss ratio was 0.3 points lower at 63.2% driven by offsetting movements in our two
segments.
In our Insurance segment, the fourth quarter 2014 current accident year loss ratio
decreased 3.1 points to 61.2%. Q4 2014 was impacted by natural catastrophe and
weather-related losses of $11 million related primarily to weather losses in North America
while we reported a benign quarter for such losses in the comparative quarter of 2013.

FINAL

After adjusting for the cat and weather activity, our current accident year loss ratio
improved by 6.4 points and was impacted by improved loss experience primarily in our
property and professional lines. Professional lines were also positively impacted by the
actions we have taken in reshaping our U.S. D&O portfolio during 2014. In contrast, the
fourth quarter of 2013 was significantly impacting by the strengthening of the reserves in
our professional lines of business due to increased loss experience.
For the full year, the current accident year loss ratio for insurance was 65.3%, up from
63.9% for the comparable period of 2013 with increased loss experienced in the property
lines and changes in the mix of business being the primary drivers. The fourth quarter
2014 current accident year loss ratio for our Reinsurance segment was comparable to the
prior-year quarter at 62%. Current quarter's results included $10 million of losses related
to natural catastrophes and weather-related losses compared to benign losses incurred in
Q4 2013.

Bloomberg Transcript

Net of cat and weather losses, the current accident year loss ratio decreased by 2%
primarily due to improved loss experience in the property and professional lines and
improvements in the performance of our European motor book. For the full year 2014, the
current accident year loss ratio for Reinsurance decreased by 1.8 points to 61.3%, primarily
driven by the reduced level of natural catastrophe and weather-related losses, which
were partially offset by changes in the mix of business and agricultural losses, primarily
due to a drop in commodity prices. As a reminder, for your information we present the
results of our Reinsurance segment net of the impact of our agriculture hedges and
cessions to our third-party capital vehicle, AXIS Ventures Re, in our financial supplement.
Turning to loss reserves established in prior years, our results continue to benefit from net
favorable loss reserve development which aggregated to $66 million during the fourth
quarter. Short-tail classes in both segments contributed $45 million of this balance,
primarily reflecting better than expected loss emergence. We recorded favorable
development of $12 million related to the reinsurance motor book, primarily related to
better than expected loss development on our European non-proportional book.
In addition, we continue to give way to actuarial methods that reflect our favorable
experience for our reinsurance professional lines which contributed $11 million, reflecting
lower loss estimates primarily for years 2008 and prior. Our full year 2014 favorable loss
reserve development was $259 million compared to $219 million recognized during 2013.
During the fourth quarter and for the full year of 2014, our acquisition cost ratio increased
by 0.9 points and 1.1 points respectively compared to the same periods in 2013. Increases
were noted in insurance due to changes in the mix of business and reduced ceding
commissions received following changes in the structure of our reinsurance programs in
prior years. Increases were also noted in the Reinsurance segment, primarily driven by
variance in accruals for loss sensitive features in underlying contracts as well as higher
acquisition cost paid on certain lines of business.
Our total general and administrative expense ratio for the fourth quarter was 17.3%
compared to 15.4% in the prior year. This increase was related to three areas. First, cost

FINAL

related to our expense optimization efforts, specifically IT sourcing and lease
abandonment of $6 million, that's $13 million for the total year. Second, one-time cost
related to severance and IT system write-offs of $7.4 million. And third, a fourth quarter
catch up in our incentive compensation accrual to reflect total year performance of $4.3
million.
The bottom line here is that our normalized expense ratio for the quarter was 15.9% and
15.4% for the year-to-date if you eliminate cost that we're incurring now to improve our
expense ratio in the future as we've outlined in our profit improvement plan and the nonrecurring costs.
Overall, the company reported underwriting income of $113 million and a combined ratio
of 91.5% for the fourth quarter. On a year-to-date basis, our underwriting income was
$462 million with a combined ratio of 91.6%. Net investment income was $79 million for the
quarter, up from $67 million in the previous quarter and down from $114 million in the
fourth quarter of 2013.

Bloomberg Transcript

The most significant driver of the quarter-over-quarter increase was the contribution to
net investment income from our other investments portfolio. Other investments
contributed $12 million during the quarter versus a loss of $3 million last quarter and a gain
of $41 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. In the aggregate, the total return on our cash
and investments portfolio for the quarter was 0.1%. For the year, the total return of our
cash and investments portfolio was 2%.
The positive total returns for the current quarter and the year were driven by realized
gains on the sale of fixed income and equities and return on hedge fund holdings. This
was tempered by price declines on our fixed maturities portfolio caused by the
strengthening of the U.S. dollar and the widening of credit spreads on both investment
grade and high-yield corporate debt.
We continue to hold a high-quality, well-diversified portfolio with cash and investment
assets totaling $14.9 billion at December 31, down approximately $0.6 billion from
September 30 and comparable to a year ago. The decrease during the quarter was
principally due to the repayment of our senior notes, which I will discuss shortly.
The duration of our fixed maturities portfolio was 2.9 years at December 31, no change
from September 30th and down from 3.2 years at the end of December 2013. Our fixed
maturities, weighted average credit rating remains unchanged at AA-minus.
Our total capital at December 31, 2014 was $6.8 billion including $1 billion of senior notes
and $628 million of preferred equity, a decrease of $0.5 billion from $7.3 billion at
September 30, 2014. The decrease was due to the repayment of the $500 million of our
5.75% senior unsecured notes that matured on December 1, 2014.
During the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million common shares at an average price of
$50.16 per share for a total cost of $75 million. For the year, our share repurchases totaled
11.8 million common shares and represent over 10% of our shares outstanding at the
Page 7 of 26

FINAL

beginning of the year at an average price of $46.22 per share for a total cost of $543
million. During the fourth quarter, we announced that effective January 1, 2015, the share
repurchase authorization program was increased to $750 million of the company's
common shares effective through December 31, 2016.
As already mentioned by Albert, during January 2015, we announced the signing of the
definitive amalgamation agreement with PartnerRe Limited. We are very excited at this
announcement and we believe that will create one of the world's preeminent specialty
insurance and reinsurance companies with gross premiums written an excess of $10
billion, total capital of more than $14 billion, and cash on invested assets of more than $33
billion.
As part of this transaction, we will suspend our current share repurchase program until the
closing of the merger. However, provided that the market and financial conditions remain
the same, we currently expect to continue our goal of returning approximately 100% of
our annual operating earnings and any excess capital to our shareholders in the form of
common dividends and share repurchases as soon as the merger transaction has been
completed.

Bloomberg Transcript

While we work on completing the PartnerRe merger transaction, we continue to progress
on the strategic expansion opportunities already initiative. We have been very pleased
with the growth of our Accident & Health business, our Lloyd's unit is making good
progress in the London market, and we expect that our third-party capital initiative, AXIS
Ventures, will expand on its capabilities in its second year of operations.
And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Albert.

Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Thank you, Joe. With respect to market conditions in insurance, we continue to see a
leveling off of pricing overall. Recall, however, that we have recently experienced several
quarters of price increases and notwithstanding some recent developments, there remain
good fundamentals and opportunities for profitable growth in many insurance lines of
business and regions.
Within our Insurance segment, during the fourth quarter, the overall AXIS insurance rate
change was minus 1%, better than the minus 3% observed last quarter, but nevertheless
down from the plus 1% experienced in the same quarter last year. Rate change for the
quarter was in line with that of the year overall, continuing the theme of relative stability in
the overall market average, but with more pressure on property and some international
specialty lines.
Generally, although not universally, there remains rationality in most price action as
evidenced by rate increases on accounts following loss activity. This drove a 6 point
rebound relative to the prior quarter in rate change for our international division to minus
2% in the quarter across the various lines. A number of large accounts in aviation and
onshore energy where we've observed recent loss activity renewed with increased
Page 8 of 26

FINAL

pricing. Causality pricing remained strong, but rate increases have moderated particularly
in U.S. excess causality.
Overall, positive rate change in our professional lines division averaged plus 1% and it's
been broadly stable since 2012. Some lines such as excess D&O saw rate pressure
intensified during the quarter, but primary layers in a number of E&O lines showed
positive rate change. Importantly, we were able to effectively navigate the market in
reshaping the primary U.S. public D&O portfolio identified for profit improvement and are
encouraged by the changes in portfolio composition and profitability achieved by our
team.
The diversity in our insurance portfolio by line and geography is serving us well in this
environment as we've been able to place emphasis where business is performing better.
Generally, the U.S. remains the strongest of the geographies in which we operate with
respect to pricing environment. And 50% of our global insurance business is generated
from the U.S. with a strong presence in excess and surplus lines, professional liability, and
casualty lines.

Bloomberg Transcript

Moving onto reinsurance, at the January 1 renewal, the trading environment remain
competitive as has been widely reported. Multi-year commitments are in great demands
broadly impacting all lines of business and non-concurrency of terms is more prevalent in
the marketplace. We participated selectively in a number of multi-year facilities where it
made sense to do so.
The greatest change in pricing was in the U.S. property catastrophe renewals with the
rates down 5% to 15%. More broadly, the overall market experienced margin compression
in the phase of rate deterioration and pressure on ceding commissions. Approximately
50% of our 2014 annual reinsurance premium is renewable at the January 1 renewal date.
Agriculture reinsurance premiums renews in the first quarter but not until much later in the
quarter.
For the expiring premium renewable on January 1, we estimate we increased premium by
about 2% on a constant dollar basis. Most lines were flattish with growth in motor and
credit and surety lines offsetting an 8% decline in cat business where we moved away
from an adequately-priced opportunities.
Within motor, we shifted more to proportional business where we expect to obtain better
risk adjusted returns than in the excess of loss lines, which has declined as a proportion of
our portfolio. We also increased our share of top trade credit insurer business.
On a positive note, while reinsurance terms are not ideal, underlying businesses are
performing well across most of our major product lines. As I've said before, there is no
favorable tide to lift all boats in a transitioning market. Quality of relationships, brands,
reputation, service and claims management, financial strength and ratings, all influence
access to business opportunities. Risk selection, risk management in portfolio
constructions are paramount in extracting the best performance out of a declining market.

FINAL

In these attributes, we believe that AXIS has a strong track record and is well positioned
to succeed.
That said, we also recognized some secular changes in our operating environment
resulting in clients demanding much more of their risk management providers. Overall,
there is a trend for clients to limit the number of companies they do business with, and
they are prepared to reward carriers that provide outstanding service, technical expertise
and capacity with a greater share of their business, and increasingly, with non-concurrent
pricing.
AXIS has the breadth and depth to provide them with a meaningful, multi-facetted
relationship. We also have the financial strength and full scale services that set us apart
from smaller players. These, coupled with our innovation and technical strength, have
allowed us to mitigate the worse effects of a highly competitive market. We remain
confident that we will continue to do well as the company with $7 billion in capital and $5
billion in gross premium.

Bloomberg Transcript

However, when the opportunities emerge with PartnerRe presented itself, we measured
the best of both companies against the very attributes required for success in this more
demanding environment. We found a combination that we could reasonably expect to
deliver a whole that was greater than the sum of the individual parts. Two strong and well
established companies coming together to create a top 20 global P&C leader whose
embedded talent, resources and combined market presence would position it as a
formidable competitor.
Last week during our call with the investment community, we talked in detail about the
amalgamation agreement we signed with PartnerRe. But I'll take a moment here to offer
further thoughts and updates. Overall, this merger takes our franchise strength to the
next level by significantly enhancing our scale and strategic flexibility, talent, capital and
operating efficiencies. With added scale and better strategic positioning in all three of our
businesses, the merger offers greater flexibility to manage our profitability and to allocate
resources across product lines to optimize growth where we find the best opportunities
anywhere in the world.
Initially, it increases our percentage of business in the reinsurance sector. But our relative
position in the reinsurance market would be so much stronger and our standing as a top 5
P&C reinsurer and largest partner to our brokers should allow us to generate and convert
on more business opportunities and deliver better profitability than that of a mid-sized
reinsurer.
Our successful Accident & Health initiative would double in size and accelerate our ability
to achieve our targeted returns. Our combined $1.5 billion life, accident and health
business would rank among the top 10 global life reinsurers and be among the top 3 A&H
player – reinsurers in the U.S.
Our global specialty insurance business would benefit immediately from additional
revenues and expanded geographic distribution. And with the backing of a $14 billion

FINAL

capital base and incremental ability to invest in growth, we should be able to deliver
profitable growth to rebalance our consolidated portfolio.
The new company will be characterized by a strong ability to generate and deploy capital.
This is the result of strong combined earnings power, driven by enhanced market
positioning, expense savings and other synergies, capital efficiencies made possible by
the combination of our two companies, increased use of third-party capital to leverage
our larger production capabilities, and excess capital accumulated before the closing as
we have both have suspended our buybacks pending the completion of the merger.
This is no small point as both firms have demonstrated a very strong record of returning
capital to shareholders over the years. And as Joe noted, we anticipate resuming share
purchase activity immediately after the close of the merger.

Bloomberg Transcript

With respect to earnings as we've said, we expect to generate at least $200 million in
annual pre-tax operating synergies resulting mainly from savings in reinsurance support
functions and corporate level expenses. We are confident these merger-related savings
can be achieved within 18 months of the merger. In addition, we estimate that
approximately $25 million or about half of the expense savings we originally expected to
obtain from AXIS' own expense optimization efforts will still be realizable in addition to the
$200 million merger-related initiatives.
Both organizations have started integration planning in earnest. Feedback from our
business partners has been very positive to date. Employees from both organizations are
excited about combining the talent, market presence, knowledge and creativity of our
organizations to benefit our customers, brokers and other business partners. They see
the benefits to each of our businesses.
I'm particularly proud that notwithstanding the normal questions that arise shortly after
such an announcement, they have redoubled their energies, not only to proceed with
merger preparatory work but also to continue to manage our business, service our clients
and brokers, and deliver on our business plans. It gives me great confidence in our ability
to effect a smooth integration and deliver on the potential created by this merger.
I've taken this time to discuss our merger with PartnerRe because, as Rick mentioned
earlier, we have limited ability at this time to answer questions on the merger as we are in
the process of preparing the relevant proxy documentation with the SEC.
With that I would like to open the line for questions related to our fourth quarter and full
year results. Operator?

Jay Cohen of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Jay Arman Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Yeah, couple questions. Thank you. I guess, Joe, on the comments on capital
management, you talked about your desire to return operating earnings back to
shareholders and maybe some additional capital, but you won't start until middle of the
year. Will you try to essentially return all of the year's earnings in a half year or should it be
– we think of it as like a prorated sort of buyback?

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

No, no, no. We try to return all of the operating earnings.

Q - Jay Arman Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. Secondly, the added expenses that you incurred this
quarter in relation to some of your expense reduction initiatives, should we expect that to
continue to some extent in 2015?

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Jay, as we've discussed before, we started that effort in the middle of 2014. And I
think I've telegraphed before that we expect our expense ratio to go up in 2015 and then
begin trending down in 2016 as we get towards our goal in 2017.

Q - Jay Arman Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Got it. And then one last question, more of a strategic question maybe for Albert. On the
A&H side, you've obviously said that your scale increases pretty significantly with this deal,
but aren't the businesses somewhat different? I mean, if they are in somewhat different
businesses, do you really get the benefit of added scale?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

That's a very good question. I think if – the businesses are mostly complimentary, but not
entirely complimentary. So PartnerRe has a strong health reinsurance business in the
United States. We also write some health reinsurance business, not only in the United
States but elsewhere in the world. And so I think there is ability to leverage those two
capabilities. On the life side, we are only a very, very small writer of life, mostly
catastrophe level, high level, high end business; they have a much stronger franchise in
life. So in both cases we'll be able to leverage that. But again with regards to the
operating structure, you would expect that the supporting operating structure of that
business will definitely achieve some efficiencies. You don't need two leadership teams
for that unit for example.

Q - Jay Arman Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Got it. No, that makes sense. Thanks for those answers.

Our next question is from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Good morning, thank you. First question is on your underlying combined ratio
improvements year-over-year seems significant. That's after like about prior four quarters
have elevated level due to the non-cat large losses, as well as a basic exchange (37:00).
I'm wondering if the fourth-quarter rate is the run rate going forward or do you see
additional areas for improvements going forward?

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Kai, it's Joe. So I would say that, we've had very strong performance in the fourth quarter. I
wouldn't say that that is a run rate number. But let me go through some of the details for
you to give you a sense. So first on insurance, it's a 6.4% improvement in the accident
year ex-cat loss ratio. And the normal things that I go through are; rate, trend, mix,
experience and anything else.
So rate and trend was slightly negative during the quarter to the point of about 1.2 points.
Mix was slightly negative to the point of 1.8 points. And experience was positive to the
extent of 8.6 points. So you can see that the experience we had in the fourth quarter was
a large contributor to the improvement. I'd say, we expect to continue to see
improvements in our experience as we go forward in 2015, maybe not quite to the same
extent that we've seen in Q4.
On the reinsurance side, we had a 2.2% improvement in the accident year loss ratio. Rate
and trend was negative by1.3%. Mix was – when I say negative, we're just shifting lines of
business, 3.8%. And experience was positive by about 1%. So on the reinsurance side, the
experience wasn't nearly as large as on the insurance side. We'd expect to see continued
positive experience on our reinsurance segment as well. So I hope that gives you some of
the background.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Great. Thanks for the detail. And then – Albert, the question – your commentary on the
Jan 1 renewal, you mentioned about non-concurrency. Could you elaborate that a little
more? You said, going forward, you see a differentiation between the reinsurer
depending on the size and the breadth of the portfolio it can provide to the clients. And
also on the terms and conditions, do you also see some difference among the reinsurers?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Yes, we do. And again, I want to be clear, it's not with every account. But as I said,
increasingly we're seeing that. And clients are favoring their reinsurers if you would, first
Page 13 of 26



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2015-02-04

by the amount of allocation they give them. There could be some changes in the ceding
commission, little bit higher, little bit lower depending on conditions, and terms, where
one could reasonably argue for somewhat better terms on the margin with regard to the
individual treaties.

FINAL

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. Could you quantify exactly sort of for the same kind of risk what kind of return you
see the difference between the most favorable terms and then the least favorable ones?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I don't think it's appropriate to do that. I think there are a number of factors, some of
which are quantifiable, other aren't. So, for example, you can easily quantify the pricing
issue. But it's more difficult to quantify the wording in terms and conditions issue and the
wordings in terms and conditions are actually potentially much more valuable long term.
Also how do you scale the value of a greater allocation on the more profitable treaties? I
can tell you that we are very clear in our own minds that there are significant benefits, but
it would be difficult to give you a precise analysis of that over the phone.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Great. Well, thank you so much for all the answers.

Our next question is from Vinay Misquith of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. Just a clarification on Kai's question on the improvement in the accident
year loss ratio ex-cat. So if I understand it correctly, do you still expect further
improvements in 2015 versus 2014 on the accident year loss ratio ex-cat both in the
Primary Insurance and in the Reinsurance segments?

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Yeah, Kai (sic) [Vinay] (41:10), I would say we expect sure improvement in the insurance
accident year loss ratios, as you know going back to CMS and professional lines. We went
through I'll call it a profit improvement plan in that line of business as well. And it takes
time to actually have that flow through financials. So we would expect to see the benefit
of that in 2015 and in 2016. So it'll take a while to get there. We have very positive results
on the property lines that can move around as you know.
On the Reinsurance side, while there are difficult market conditions out there, we still
believe there is room to improve profit with the existing book of business that we have.
So we'd expect some improvement, but I wouldn't extrapolate what you saw in the fourth
quarter for the Insurance side for sure and Reinsurance.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Sure.

FINAL

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

If I could add to that – Vinay, if I could add to that, Joe went through it but I'd like to bring
you back to the conversation we had six months ago when we talked about our overall
program to try and improve our combined ratio by 3 points to 4 points – 4 points to 5
points, I'm sorry, over the average achieved in the first half of 2014. And you'll recall at
that point, we gave you a number of different areas of progress. So, the first one was that
there were areas like CMS where we were continuing to work to improve the profitability
of the book of business and we would expect that as our corrective actions took hold, we
would over time achieve a lower loss ratio. And we, I think predicted that we would we
one point to two points lower in that area by the end of the year, and we delivered on
that. And I think our team did a great job. Our actuaries have a lot of confidence in the
quality of the book of business. And of course as we continue to earn outside book, we
expect to see further benefits.

Bloomberg Transcript

The second thing we talked about was the very strong transformation of our organization
towards optimizing the use of data and analytics to shape all of our portfolios. And I can
assure you that as much work as we've done in 2014, there is still a lot of work to be done
going forward. And I expect further benefits of the improvements in the overall quality
and balance of our portfolios as we apply the findings of our analytics to better shape the
portfolio.
The third part that he talked about was that we believe that over time the changes that
we've made should make our portfolio less susceptible to large and outside cat losses.
And while that has not yet been tested because we've had a low cat environment, we
continue to have confidence of the changes we made in our cat book, will result on
average in a better relative performance than it's had in the past with regard to cat
losses.
So there are a number of areas that we still will continue to work on, which we continue to
anticipate will deliver positive results. The volatile lines, property and so on, it was an
average quarter. We will have other quarters that will be a little bit better or a little bit
worse, but we do believe that we continue to make progress in the overall quality and
profitability of our book of business.

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

And Vinay, it's Joe. I'll just add one thing to what Albert said with respect to new initiatives
because we outlined that as part of our profit improvement plans. We are reaching critical
mass with our new initiatives. And that's lessening the drag on our results. We had over
$100 million more in gross premiums written in new initiatives in 2014 than we did in 2013
and the combined ratios of those businesses are improving. So I just wanted to add that
to what Albert said.

Q - Vinay Misquith

Page 15 of 26



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2015-02-04

Sure, that's helpful. And just wanted to clarify, so the improvements you're seeing in 2015
is – versus the fourth quarter of this year, correct, not for the entire year, correct?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

FINAL

That's correct. Subject to the normal volatility that you have to expect in our business.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Sure, fair enough. Now within the primary insurance, that's understandable because you
had explained to us what was happening. Just a little surprised on the reinsurance side
since we're hearing pricing is pretty weak. So curious how you're managing to get margin
improvement in reinsurance despite pricing been down quite significantly?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

That's a very fair point. And I think we would – I hope we were clear when we discussed
the fact that these improvements that we were doing were independent of market
conditions. And to the extent that we have adverse market conditions, obviously, we will
have to absorb that. But where we feel good is that we'd rather be facing deterioration in
markets with some internal efforts that we know will offset the headwinds of adverse
market. So we're not saying that we're going to get to a – from our original plan, that it
was 4 points to 5 points improvement in the combined ratio, no matter what happens in
the market. What we're saying is we expect that, internally, we can deliver 4 points to 5
points improvement. To the extent that the market goes against us, obviously, that
improvement will be offset by any reduction created by the market.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Fair enough. And then one last point. On the expense saves, I didn't know if I've just
understood it correctly. So was it $50 million of expense saves that AXIS thought that they
would achieve and now post-merger you think that you can still sort of achieve the $25
million. Is that right?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Yeah. Again, recall that there were two components to our improvement in the expense
ratio. The first as Joe just pointed out was simply the fact that we have significant number
of businesses that were still in growth mode and that for the moment are generating
premiums, but not sufficiently – not of a sufficient amount to achieve the target G&A ratio.
So as these businesses grow, they will – just through their growth not through a reduction
of expense, they will deliver a reduction in our expense ratio.
In addition, there were a number of programs that we had put in place and then we had
highlighted some of them to you including office rationalization, vendor management, IT,
outsourcing, some additional work that we were doing that we believe will generate a
true either cost savings or further cost avoidance stopping the cost curve.
When we looked at the merger with PartnerRe, clearly, there is a fair amount of overlap in
the areas of reinsurance and in the areas of corporate expenses. To the extent that we
Page 16 of 26



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td

Date: 2015-02-04

FINAL

were going to look at revamp some of those through the merger, obviously, the original
savings that we had anticipated in reinsurance and corporate were now subsumed by the
new initiatives that came about as a result of the merger. But as we've just discussed,
there was a very little overlap in the Reinsurance and A&H business, and therefore many
of the initiatives that we had in place will continue to provide some benefit there.

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

I think you meant insurance.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Did I say, I apologize, insurance and A&H. My apologies.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Okay. Sorry to beat the dead horse. So from the $200 million just to minus $25 million,
which was an overlap and the rest is you should still get. Is that right?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, again, I think we should be precise. The $200 million is what is achievable as a result
of the merger. And then we believe that there's an additional $25 million or so that is
available in areas that have not been as affected by the merger, specifically in the areas
of insurance and A&H.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Our next question is from Dan Farrell of Sterne, Agee. Please go ahead.

Q - Dan Farrell

{BIO 4935961 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. I just had a question on the Insurance segment with regard to any mix
changes you're still trying to do. Are you still expanding lines that might be having better
loss ratios? Is there any mix component to think about in the trend of the accident year
loss ratio from that perspective?
And then also with regard to your efforts to improve overall risk of the book, you've done
a lot in terms of reducing cat – aggregate catastrophe exposure. How far along do you
think you are there? Do you think there is more to do? And obviously you don't necessarily
see the benefits of that until there is an event and in fact it can actually hurt your – make

Page 17 of 26



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td

the earnings look little worse until there is something. So I was wondering if you could just
talk about that a little more as well.

FINAL

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Yeah. I'd say, we're pretty close to achieving steady state in terms of the desired books
that we want. That said some of the areas where we are growing – the same areas that
we were talking about reaching scale, include our reentry into the U.S. primary casualty
business, the retail excess casualty business, the DP&E business, med-mal, all of which
are more in the professional lines area than they are in the property type areas. So as
these grow, clearly they will have a modest impact on the book.
On the other hand, our Lloyd's operation is giving us access to more business which is
more akin to what we have in our international division and that does tend to have a lower
loss ratio. And as we've spoken about expanding that book of business to more into Asia
and into Latin America and so on, should provide more of that property type or specialty
type loss ratio. So we start some initiatives that are growing. On the other hand, I think the
strategic shift is pretty much where it needs to be.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now, with regard to catastrophe, obviously, it will depend on the opportunities that we
have available to us. And increasingly – and you will have noticed a small increase in some
areas with regards to our cat line. Increasingly, we view our production of catastrophe
premium both as an opportunity to create a good book for ourselves, but also to
generate attractive risk for our third capital partners. So we could continue to be active in
growing on the cat side even if at some point in time we might not necessarily be growing
on a net basis.

Q - Dan Farrell

{BIO 4935961 <GO>}

Okay. That's helpful. And then just a question on Accident & Health. Can you expand a
little more on your efforts to grow it on an insurance basis versus a reinsurance? Where
that mix is and how you're thinking about the growth in – on an insurance basis? And then
can you remind us is there any profitability difference if you do it on a insurance or
reinsurance basis?

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Dan, in terms of the mix between insurance and reinsurance as we stand now and this is
on a gross premiums written basis, it's 52% insurance versus 48% reinsurance. And if you
split that between our, call it, our North America business and international, that split is
about 46%-54%. Let me just make a couple of comments on A&H. I know you didn't
specifically asked this but I'll mention it in anyway. As Albert said, we're on track with our
plans; we had an excellent year in A&H in 2014. We exceeded our production goals. We
wrote $280 million in premium, which is above our goal. We've exceeded the profit goals,
and frankly, we have a good pipeline of future opportunities. So back to your prior
question in terms of mix, A&H contributed substantially to the – I'll call it, the growth in mix
in the loss ratio, it was – I apologize – here I just had a – it was about 4% of the change in
the mix in the quarter and about 1.7 points on a year-to-date basis. So I would agree with
what Albert said, but I would just say that in terms of mix, we would expect with the

Page 18 of 26



Company N ame: Axis Capital H oldings L td
Company Ticker: AXS US Equity
Date: 2015-02-04

growing opportunities we have in A&H that that to become a bigger contributor, if you
will, to the change in mix.

Our next question is from Ryan Byrnes of Janney Capital. Please go ahead.

Q - Ryan Byrnes

{BIO 16902592 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. Congrats. Nice little (53:19) quarter. Just had a question. Could
you guys just give a little more color on the weather derivative loss in the quarter? Just
wanted to see what that is and see if that's model-able going forward?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

There are a number of articles in that line and so there are really three different pieces in
that line. One is the expenses of managing our third-party capital is in there, which is an
expense. The second issue is that's where we put our crop hedges. And you'll know – and
you'll recall that we had a benefit with regard to the crop hedges in the third quarter. Now,
crop prices did go up in the fourth quarter, which reduced the value of those hedges. And
so that ends up giving you a contribution to a negative. And the third piece and the
largest piece of that is with regards to our weather and commodities unit, which provided
some warm weather coverages to European utilities among other coverages that we
provide. The first half of the winter was actually quite warm in Europe and so there were
some mark-to-market adjustments to reflect that. And that's basically what the issue is.
Without providing any guidance, the January weather appears to have been colder, and
so we would expect to see some – at least through the end of January, some favorable
adjustment to that number. But these are derivatives and therefore they're booked on a
mark-to-market basis. And until you close up the contract, there's going to be some
volatility there.

Great. Thanks for the color on that one. That's helpful. And then also just quickly wanted

because we've seen some primary guys adjust their loss ratios lower? Just wanted to see
where you guys are seeing that book?

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Okay. Let me give you an overview of agriculture for the year, Ryan. We ended the year at
$166 million in gross written premium versus we were about $132 million a year ago. We
had a small underwriting loss in the fourth quarter. We expect full-year results to be in the
$110 million to $115 million range. So based upon fourth quarter activity, we increased, if
you will, the expected results from where they were in the third quarter.
Just to talk about fourth quarter for a minute. Prices improved from the Q3 in the
underlying commodities that we had on the revenue products that we discussed in Q3.
However, we've incurred slightly higher claim activity and also had a slight hedge loss. So
in effect, that offset the price improvement. So, that gives you a little color on the fourth
quarter and then what we expect for the full-year.

Q - Ryan Byrnes

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Thank you. I wanted to just talk little bit about the loss ceded to the minority interest. And
given your disclosure on what's inside the reinsurance other line, I wonder if those two
lines are related at all?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

The investment in – the risk that we cede to the third-party capital is not all – first of all, it's
important to say that it's not all noted in that line, because what you have in that line are
risks that are ceded through our specialty vehicles. We do also cede other risk to thirdparty capital through transformers and other rated parties that simply find its way through
the reinsurance ceded line. On the other hand, we still get the same terms and benefits
as we would in a third-party capital management. That line that you have there does in
fact include their share of the gains and losses of the business we cede to them. It is
independent of the other income line.

profitable to them. So the one area where there has been a loss transferred to third-party
capital partners has been in the crop area.

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

And Josh, just to supplement that a little bit, during 2014, we completed eight
transactions in AXIS Ventures, and while the financial results are not very material to 2014,
it sets us up very well for 2015. I'll say segment income for AXIS Ventures was
approximately $3 million in 2014 that was to just give you an idea.

place for both companies in the event that someone else would try and disrupt this

from someone to buy AXIS and to what extent, with the change in management at

Q - Brian Robert Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Hey, just one quick one here. Albert, on the trade credit reinsurance business, any
pressure there from – on loss trend due to energy price declines, FX, all that kind of stuff ?
And then kind of as a follow on that, is that a business where the cedents are focused on
or look at concentration of reinsurance companies on their programs?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

With regard to the trade credit, it really truly is operating receivables mostly. And as you
know, this is very short-term business and the leading trade credit insurers have a very
strong capability of adapting their book of business, of adjusting their limits, such that
basically the true tail on that business is, on a practical basis, less than six months. So
when they see things that are moving forward, they stop insuring new receivables. Those
receivables get paid and their exposures come down. It's a line of business that we like
because, again the – our trade credit partners do a very, very good job of monitoring their
exposures.
With regards to managing their concentrations with reinsurers, I expect that everybody
looks at their concentration with reinsurers. However, they always give more to those
reinsurers who have more capital, better ability to service them and are on a strong basis.
So I wouldn't read anything into that answer.

And I guess my question is, I think, and Albert said, it was an average Property year loss.
So I guess what I'm curious about in that improvement is how much of that improvement
is kind of from lack of fortuitous events as opposed to the rerating of the book that
happened over the first-half of the year.

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Yeah, so let me give you the details on how the experience breaks down first. If you look
at three lines of business, it's primarily generated by Property. It's generated by Accident
& Health and it's generated by professional lines. But let me give you an overall answer to
it. In 2014 – Q4, 2014, we had cat- and weather-related losses of $21 million or 2.2 points,
and mid-size losses of $26 million or 2.8 points for a total of $47 million or five points. In
Q4, 2014 – I'm sorry 2013, we had cat- and weather-related losses of minus $5 million or
0.5 points and mid-size losses of $51 million or 5.5 points.
So what I'm saying is, in total, we had about the same level of total cat- and weatherrelated and mid-size losses, but we had much lower mid-size losses. So our improvement
was primarily because we've had actually a pretty good third quarter and a very good
fourth quarter in terms of loss activity on the Property lines of business.

Q - Charles J. Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

Okay, and one final one, you had a large change in case reserves in the quarter in the
insurance book. Just wondering what – how that gets worked out, in terms of – just some
understanding on how, I think it's $57.5 million reduction in case reserves. Is that just
closed accounts for 2014, is how that – the reason for that?

A - Joseph C. Henry

{BIO 13390626 <GO>}

Yeah. I don't have a detailed breakdown of the case reserve changes, but I can tell you
that we had one or two large cases that were settled during the fourth quarter, and that
actually was one of the reasons for our – the increase in our paid to incurred loss ratios in
the financial supplemental.

Excellent. Thank you very much for the answers.

Our next question is from Meyer Shields of KBW. Please go ahead.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Thanks. Good morning. I appreciate your patience this morning. Albert, on the primary
side, is there any increased exposure in trade credit from the foreign currency
fluctuations?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Not really, again, because those are short-term. I think the trade credit, first of all, is on the
reinsurance side, not on the primary side. And there's no question that we do have a
large European book. We do have a fair amount of premiums that are written in euros. So
when we translate those premiums going forward, I think there will be an impact both on
the premium as well as on any losses or any expenses that we incur. So there will be that
impact. But in terms of the business itself, I don't anticipate any material increase in risk
profile, because of the FX changes.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay, perfect. That's all I have.

Our last question is from Cliff Gallant of Nomura. Please go ahead.

Q - Cliff H. Gallant

{BIO 1854853 <GO>}

Thanks for taking the questions. I just wanted to know how would you characterize the run
rate level of ROE right now? I know it's sort of a general question. There's a lot of moving
pieces behind that. But you started the call by highlighting the 9.3% you got in the quarter.
But if I were to normalize that by splitting some of the one-time expenses, but also
looking at it excluding reserve releases, on an accident year basis, the ROE is sort of midsingle digit, and for a quarter without any large property or catastrophes, that doesn't
seem like that's the level where you'd want to be?

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

That's fair. I would say three things to that. The first is, part of having a reserving
philosophy that generates relatively regular reserve releases incorporates booking the
current year more prudently. And so whatever number you have, you're probably looking
at something which is a more prudent evaluation of the loss ratio. And if you were to go
purely to the mid-point, I would anticipate that you would see a higher number that would
be number one.
Number two, we did have two negatives in the quarter. One being what I would call some
of the volatility on the hedge fund returns. So if you look at our average hedge fund
returns for the year or for a three-year period, they certainly have looked better than they

have recently, so that's a hit. And the third area is what we discussed earlier with regard to
the fact that there are some investments that we're making, and frankly, some one-time
expenses that we don't expect to recur on the expense side. So those are the three
factors that would make your, I presumably said, I think you said mid-single digit. Those
are the three factors that I would say you would have to normalize to your mid-single digit
number that you've achieved to obtain what we believe is a more run rate ROE number
for the organization.

Q - Cliff H. Gallant

{BIO 1854853 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. I can't help but comment that on the first point with the reserve
releases, thinking about what is run rate that (01:07:38). You're saying that in valuing a
company, you should consider reserve redundancies and reserve releases as part of – as
ongoing earnings power.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

I would hope to god that you would consider that and a lot of other things, Cliff.

Q - Cliff H. Gallant

{BIO 1854853 <GO>}

Fair enough. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over
to Albert Benchimol for any closing remarks.

A - Albert A. Benchimol

{BIO 2023727 <GO>}

Well, thank you very much for your attention and for your time here. These are obviously
very exciting times here at AXIS. Again, I could not finish this call without thanking our team
for the great work that they've done during the year.
This fourth quarter results, and specifically the improvements that we've achieved in the
number of underwriting areas, really speak to the focus that our team has had at using
data and analytics to improve the quality of their portfolios, and it speaks to their
relationships with the clients and brokers that they've been able to make those changes,
while still retaining high retention ratios and winning new business. I think that speaks a lot
to the quality of the AXIS franchise. And again, we hope to be speaking with you soon
with further progress on this exciting merger that we have with PartnerRe. Thank you all.

The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may
