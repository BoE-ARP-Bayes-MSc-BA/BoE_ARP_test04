Thank you, Spencer. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining this conference. I
hope you have a chance to read our full-year 2017 results announcement from this
morning and to see our briefing video on the Generali corporate website, we are
definitely proud of these results, of the results we have presented today. They definitely
reflect the successful execution of the industrial turnaround we started two years ago and
we are very confident that we will reach all the objective and achieve all the targets by the
end of 2018.
We look forward to seeing all of you at our Investor Day in Milan on November 21st this
year and on this day, we will be able to unveil the next phase of our development to – we
will be able to present you our new strategy which will be based on transformation and
profitable growth. So thank you again for joining our call today.
I will be – answer to your question together with Luigi and a few other colleagues and we
would like to invite you to start asking your question.

We will take our first question from James Shuck from Citi. Please go ahead, your line is
open.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. Thank you for taking my questions. I had three questions,
please. Firstly, on the normalized capital generation. So, I think this is the first year you're
actually breaking out into the own funds developments and the SCR. I can see that the
SCR is a negative move, i.e., a release and that looks to have been the case last year as
well. I presume that's one reason why your operating capital generation is so strong.
Really, my question is how sustainable is that SCR development. And if you're able to
break it out into the SCR that runs off from the back book versus the incremental
requirements on new business, that would be helpful.
Second question, on the net cash remittances. So each year now, I think since 2012, you're
showing a very healthy balance as you're remitting capital or cash up to the holdco where
it pays the central costs and then funds the dividend. If I add up what's happened since
2012 and there's another €900 million net of dividend that's added to 2017 is about €4
billion of increase in central liquidity. Could you kind of just confirm where you are in terms
of the stock of liquidity at the holdco and exactly what you intend to use that for?
It looks like you're accumulating cash at the holdco. But really, I just want to get some
insight into whether there are other demands on that surplus or if it is actually available to
be paid out. And kind of connected with that, the €2.5 billion of gross remittances, is that
a normal run rate that we can expect or is there any kind of running down of free surplus
anywhere? I appreciate there is a small number, €0.2 billion from France. But is there any
Page 2 of 24



FINAL

Company Ticker: G I M Equity

running down of surplus elsewhere? Final question just is around the free surplus
emergence. In your own funds supplementary information, you used to split out the free
surplus emergence by bucket. So you can actually see how that emerges into cash. And
you stopped doing that now and really I had a question around how quickly it emerges
into cash because 2016, it shows a very fast runoff. About 60% of the free surplus
emerges in the first 10 years, which looks very fast versus others. And really I was
interested to know the reason for that and also request that you actually return that
disclosure, that would be helpful. Apologies for that length of questionings, but those are
it for now. Thank you.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Okay. Hi, James, good afternoon. This is Luigi speaking. By the way, welcome everyone on
the line. So your first question is on the SCR. Actually in the analyst presentation, we do
split that. So you can see on slide 23...

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Yeah.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

...the consumptions from life new business and the other variation. As you know, I mean
this – I think should not be surprising the fact that we are having benefit from SCR
reduction because that reflects our strategy. You know that our strategy has a clear
declared focus of moving towards capital-light products and that's one outcome. I would
say that complementing that, you also have the ever greater focus or on risk-adjusted
performance in investment selection, which also contributes to that. I would say those
would be the main drivers at the fringe, possibly also while they are disposed of, the
disposal of companies also have some impact on that, but those would be the main
drivers of the SCR. Sustainability, clearly to the extent that we continue replacing, let's say
"old portfolio" with new business, you're bound to be seeing some gap of this kind going
forward. Clearly asymptotically, this will be reduced. Your...

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

So would you expect SCR to decline going forward, continue to decline over the medium
term?

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Yeah, I mean these are not a massive decline, we're talking about, right, but clearly with
the replacement, there is some decline, yes. Your question on the net cash remittances.
I'm glad you like them. I'd say as – actually thank you for the question because basically,
can I say that both your second and third question are somehow connected. So indeed,
that's been an ongoing focus of Generali, increasing the remittance from subsidiary. Last
year, we had an increase of €400 million year-on-year and this year, we added €200
million. Indeed, there is an operation in France, which adds, let's say, about €250 million to
this increase and going forward, we'll certainly have an increasing focus. But clearly once
you work on this kind of transaction, such as the one in France, it doesn't necessarily
mean, they'll always come from the same place. So, I'd say that seen from your
Page 3 of 24

FINAL

perspective, from the perspective or an analyst or an investor, I would rather focus on the
total amount rather than where it comes from because clearly, in terms of location, there
can be differences. I would then say we are running down surplus. If all our companies
continue to be well capitalized, on balance everywhere where we operate, but clearly
these remittances and the capital transactions that we may perform clearly reflect the
existence of surplus, yes.
Then, you were asking me about the cash at the parent company. There, the figures can
be found in the individual accounts. In terms of the cash surplus emergence, we have
always given the figures on new business and they continue to be in this report
(00:09:09) as well. The certainly part of disclosure we're looking to enhance and we
possibly may do so the next year.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Are you able to comment just on the speed of the release of free surplus at least based
on 2016 when it's the last time you disclosed it? Because it looks like about 60% emerges
within 10 years, it looks very fast.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Excuse me what looks very fast?

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

The emergence of free surplus into cash. So the – or the free surplus emergence as
shown in 2016, you have 60% of it emerges in the first 10 years, which looks very fast and
I can't see that number in the 2017 disclosure anyway, but I'm just intrigued why it's – it
releases into cash so quickly.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

I can tell you it's broadly similar this year in terms of behavior.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

FINAL

Thank you very much. I guess the first one was on M&A. I mean, I was very pleased to see
some of your comments that you expect to conclude all of your disposals within the next
few months. I was wondering if you could just sort of give a general comment on the sort
of the environment for M&A both in terms of potential – the partners and also regulatory
backdrop. I mean, I appreciate that Generali Leben is not included in your original strategy
disposals, but any comment you can make about the environment would be very helpful.
Secondly, on the Non-Life, your acquisition expense ratio ticked up, which you attributed
to investments. I'm just wondering if you could mention what the outlook for that is. I
mean, should we expect those investments to fall away or is there an ongoing element
there?
And then finally perhaps on the solvency move, which I mean is a very strong solvency
ratio and I guess a lot higher than was reported at Q3. I'm just wondering if you can
explain the moves in particular across the last quarter of the year and maybe in particular
how much was from real estate and I'm not sure if you're able to give any comments on
the proposal recommendations from you over the couple of weeks ago, whether those
might have any impact on your regulatory ratio? Thank you very much.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Philippe Donnet

{BIO 4657671 <GO>}

Thank you. I will start answering on the M&A and then I will let Luigi answer the other
questions. Our disposal programs is proceeding very well, absolutely in line with our
targets. We are quite confident that we will be able to complete this disposal program by
the end of this year. As you know, we already announced a few disposals and definitely
there is more to come quite soon. We are quite satisfied with the prices. You probably
remember that we said that we were expecting €1 billion as the proceeds of these
disposals. I am – I can tell you today that we will definitely exceed this €1 billion. On the
acquisition cost on P&C business and Solvency II, I will let Luigi answer.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon, Peter. In terms of the acquisition expenses, I would say that what
you see this year is very consistent with what you saw in 2016 and what you have been
seeing throughout this year. Yes indeed, Generali has a strategic focus declared, strategic
focus of seeking to enlarge the proportion of non-motor business coming in its sales and
that has a different commissioning grade. I mean, I wouldn't say it's s super major variation
in terms of the expense. It's really ticked up a bit. I wouldn't say it's tremendously large,
but indeed there was one and certainly in terms of strategic intention by the group going
forward, it's something that I cannot tell you to what extent, but – and how it will impact.
It's also a matter of mix and so it's not necessary there's higher rates, but to the extent
that the mix in sales swings towards non-motor business, you are bound to have some
variations of these kind.
So the last question was about the Solvency move. The Solvency move, in terms of the
drivers year-on-year, I encourage you to read the (00:14:51) report because there it's
explaining in detail. The last quarter, in addition to the normal capital generation, you had
primarily operating variances and a minor contribution from financial variances due to
higher rates.

recommendations?

FINAL

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Yes. And I mean, still assessing it, we wouldn't anticipate any terribly significantly impact
from that.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thanks very much.

A - Philippe Donnet

{BIO 4657671 <GO>}

Yes, maybe, sorry I forgot to say a word about Generali Leben. As you know, Generali
Leben has been put in your runoff as it was announced last year. We are still in the process
of evaluating two options. One of them is the internal management of the runoff, the
other option, which is still on the table, is the disposal of Generali Leben and I, quite
confident that we are very close to make a final decision on this. And definitely, as you
mentioned, this was not part of the list of the companies to be sold.

The next question comes from Thomas Seidl from Bernstein. Please go ahead, your line is
open.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you. Good afternoon. First question is on the strategic program, 2016 to
2018, I think at the Investor Day 2016, you indicated operating profit should grow 5% now.
Two years into this program, it's 2.4% accumulated and you specifically focused on
technical excellence. Now, when I look at the two probably most important metrics here in
P&C, the underlying loss ratio in light, the technical margin, both are actually stable and in
light, actually it's slightly declining. So I wonder how you would assess progress on
technical excellence and should we expect now technical excellence to accelerate in the
final year of the program, that's point one? Point two, on the reserve releases, 7.1%, I think
it was in H2. I mean, you are basically running a pretty short-tailed P&C book. So I wonder
what is the source of such a high reserve release and how sustainable this high-level of
reserve releases on a short-tail retail P&C book in Europe? I mean, this is much higher
than we see it elsewhere in P&C retail in Europe. And thirdly, on the gains, a bit surprised.
You told us one, two years ago that you are going down on realized gains now 2017, net
gains, so net of impairments is 1.7%, which is close to all-time high. So, I wonder what has
made you change your mind and going back to very high level of realized gains. Thank
you.

Hi, Thomas. Good afternoon.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

FINAL

Good afternoon.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

So, I would say you have to bear in mind the figures this year, right? If you look at the
technical results, bear in mind, I mean, if you crudely look at it the way it is, you have to
acknowledge the fact that you have a higher level of Cat losses this year than you had a
year ago.

Bloomberg Transcript

And we also had, at the end of last quarter of the year, some legal developments in
France, which have an impact on that. I would say that in terms of what was pursued, in
terms of performance by the group, say, be it the margins that we are having on new
business in Life, the combined ratio which is industry-leading in terms of level and overall,
the – I would say precision in the execution of our strategy in terms of the steering of
sales towards what we announced strategically, I would say that all of that is very well in
check.
Then the variations, the exact numerical variations by year will have to be seen, we still
have a year to go. And as I say, this year is affected by some elements, which are, well,
volatile in nature. But I would say that the quality of what is steering the results this year
and last year as well is there and is very precisely traceable to management actions in that
regard. Thank you for asking the question on the reserve release because I think it's a
question that it's very legitimate and we saw that in the initial reactions and it's very good
as you bring it up.
I also take the opportunity to discuss in terms of the overall performance of the combined
ratio. I'd say what the figures that we're showing tell you is that the loss ratio of the
recurring business this year has improved. This is actually in line with what we discussed
now in the sense that the group holds very well in check the – its underwriting. We had
more Nat Cat, it's a random factor. The prior-year release, although to a minor extent,
was a smaller amount than it was a year ago, but certainly we had less contribution from
that. I encourage you to look at the annual report (00:21:08) information on the annual
report that you have the triangles, you will see that the performance on triangles of the
group is very consistent and I will repeat exactly the same explanation I gave a year ago.
Simply we – Generali is a group that is disciplined whenever it has to reserve a claim and
certainly no shortage of care when doing that and what happens is simply that when we
will liquidate the claims, the claims end up costing us less and this is what is being
reflected here. If it were a depletion of reserves, we would not have the runoffs we show
in our triangles. We – although it's a less precise gauge, also the claims to reserves ratio is
pretty stable at around 150%. You will find that information as well in the management
report.

FINAL

So I'd say that all of this gives you a picture of a group that simply is careful about its
underwriting and holds its current performance in check; that's my reading of the Non-Life
– on the Non-Life performance, but anyway of course, very willing to go deeper into that. I
am a bit surprised by your statement on realization gains because actually the impact on
the profit of the year, I mean, the actual bottom line of the realization gains this year is
smaller than it was last year.
We are about €30 million less on the bottom line from realization gains. You have to
realize that most of the – you do see I think, I mean if you look at it gross, I'd say that the
figure, you are right. But bear in mind that that gross is gross of policyholder shares. So
most of those gains stay in the life account and don't accrue to the shareholder.
So actually no, I would say that this year, this year, the impact of gains is, for the
shareholders, smaller, and actually I also take the opportunity of your question to highlight
something that is very relevant is that the level of impairments this year is the lowest in
five years and it follows a decreasing trend on five years. The figure this year is half the
figure it was a year ago and that I think is undoubtedly a positive development.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I mean maybe just one follow-up if I may on the gains, I'm talking here, gains net of
impairments and so last year, this was about €1 billion, this year, it's €1.7 billion and the
percentage policyholders get is roughly stable at 79.6%. So I would say then the bottom
line impact gains net of impairments must be, what is it, €140 million higher, 20% of the
€700 million must be higher this year, no?

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Yeah, but it actually is smaller, Thomas, than a year ago.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

All right. And maybe on the PYD on the reserve releases, is it correct to assume this is
mainly from the very good Italian years 2012 to 2014, or is it, you say evenly spread on,
let's say, 10 years?

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

I mean, the actual figure by country is not disclosed, but I'd say that qualitatively in order
to answer your question, Generali is very well reserved everywhere and I wouldn't say that
Italy is certainly a country that is well reserved. But I wouldn't say that Italy stands out as
the best country. It's a country which is certainly very okay, but it's across geographical
presence.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

All right. Thank you very much, Luigi.

The next question comes from Farooq Hanif from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, your
line is open.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi. Thank you very much for taking my questions. I wanted to go back on the comment
that, Philippe, you just made about the confidence on the €1 billion. Could you just remind
us where you are to date and when you say the implication from the way you were saying
it, maybe it's my reading of it, was that you'd be materially bigger than €1 billion.
Could you just comment on that? Secondly, on the capital generation numbers and the
dividend, I take it – I mean I understand that you've got these targets for 2018, but it
seems to me that there is this big opportunity of convergence in cash – in sort of liquidity,
ability to pay dividends and this theoretical capital generation number. Is this going to be a
big theme in November? I mean is this something that you expect to happen so
potentially much better dividend growth going forward?

Bloomberg Transcript

And then finally, you've got €250 million of debt I think in 2018, hybrid capital, another
€750 million in 2019. Are you able to allow this debt to essentially mature without
refinancing you in (00:26:24) that position? Thank you.

A - Philippe Donnet

{BIO 4657671 <GO>}

Well, on the first one, yes. When I look at what we have already solved, when I look at
what we are – when I look at the negotiations that are undergoing, I couldn't confirm you
that we will definitely exceed the €1 billion and when I say this, once again to be clear, I am
excluding potential disposal of Generali Leben. So excluding potential disposal of Generali
Leben, we will definitely exceed the €1 billion. I'm not going to tell you how much we're
going to exceed the €1 billion because I don't know that. But I confirm that we will exceed
the €1 billion.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Okay. So in terms of capital generation, I – we are not, clearly not yet going to say what
we're going to discuss at the Investor Day. But I think this is an easy one. This of course
capital and cash, all the management of capital and cash will surely be among the subjects
we will cover in our Investor Day. Of course the content of what we're going to disclose
you, you will see by then. As I said before, when answering the question on the
remittance from subsidiaries, I think that it is evident from our actions rather than from our
words that we are clearly working on this consistently and with increasing results, so that is
something we are continuing to do. Sorry, questions, the...
Tax, yeah.

FINAL

Yes. The – for the moment, we have announced the repayment of the €250 million. With
respect to the rest of debt, we'll be updating you going forward in terms of the action
that we take. Because this of course depends also on the employment of cash for
different purposes due to the group's growth.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

But just – if I might be a bit cheeky and ask again on that last question. I mean, are you
able today? Obviously you might have other uses for capital, but are you able to also
retire the €750 million in 2019?

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Well, in terms of theoretically, if there were only, I mean, just to use a back-of-theenvelope number. Mr. Donnet just told you of the €1 billion proceeds, if you use €250
million of that to retire this €250 million, you precisely have €750 million, no, so, in terms
of actual availability of cash, yes, the fact is there are other uses of cash and it's a decision
that is taken as part of the overall cash management policy of the group.

Q - Farooq Hanif

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Hi there (00:30:16). Thank you very much. Two questions, just wanted to come back on
disposals. You do sound a lot more optimistic about a Generali Leben disposal and I
wonder and obviously it's limited what you can say. But I wonder could you tell us more
about what would make you choose a disposal rather than keeping the business? And
then the second question is just an update on the timing of the full regulatory approval for
the Economic Solvency Ratio, what sort of timescale do you see there? Thank you.

A - Philippe Donnet

{BIO 4657671 <GO>}

Yes, on Generali Leben I am just realistic, so I know that to manage internally, the runoff is
an option, we have it, we have this option. And I know that we also have another option.
So we will decide according to some rationales, which will be financials obviously, but not
only financials. We also want to make sure that our customers will be managed properly.
We are not exiting the German market, it's proper, the opposite. We are doing this to
strengthen our position, our distribution, our brand in Germany. We are strengthening our
market position in Germany. So we will make a decision. We will make the best decision in
the interest of the shareholders and the policyholders of our company. And once again,
we will take this decision quite soon.

On the regulatory approval – yeah.

Yes, with regard to the regulatory approval, I mean this is a popular question, which tends
to receive the answer. In addition to regulatory compliance, we will develop a discipline
that's called regulatory forecasting. But the – as you know, we have the usual process –
the IMR processes that are ongoing for the countries in which we apply. And our answer
remains the same. We have ongoing processing and over the next two, three years, we
trust that we will be receiving the approvals, but as I say, we trust it's a decision that
ultimately rests in the hand of the supervisors we apply to.

Yes. Hi, good morning, guys. Three questions. The first one is on the real estate portfolio.
If you run an appraisal of the portfolio and if the market value has grown in 2017 and if this
is the reason why you reported €1 billion of economic variances in equities and real estate.
The second question is on the 66% increase in the operating profit of the Asset

Management business. I was wondering if this is coming from revenues or from lower
costs and in the case of revenues, if there is a component linked to performance fees
explaining this result. The third and last question is on the sensitivity of your Economic
Solvency II corporate bonds and in particular the fact that the sensitivity is still three points,
but for a 50 bps widening in spreads, while last year, it was 3 points for 100 bps of
spreads widening? Thank you.

Okay. So the – your first question, the market value has grown and also the stock of – by €1
billion and also the, let's say, stock of investments has grown. You were asking us when
we value them. Basically we have every year about one-third is revalued and the rest is
valued according to a desk valuation and it's rolled every year.
The increase in the operating profit of Asset Management was mainly driven by this shift
towards real assets and the commissions thereof, as we said, in our – when we
announced a strategy about Asset Management, it was not a matter of performance
fees. The sensitivity to corporate bonds, the actual numerical figures we would have to
dig into. I can tell you qualitatively that this year, you can appreciate a shift in the
composition of our investment portfolio away from corporate bonds and into government
bonds. Within corporate bonds, there also has been a shift towards, let's say,
comparatively less volatile categories. And there's also a larger – lastly to explain your – to
answer your question, there's a larger absorption by liabilities.

{BIO 15743259 <GO>}

Hello. Thanks for taking my questions. You've already achieved or you've achieved in 2018
your €200 million cost target. Could you tell us if there's more to come in 2018, the rest
of this year or do we have to wait until another target might be announced at the Investor
Day? And then on your Asset Management business, your net result has increased nearly
€70 million. That's nearly half of the target that you've got and this is only in one year and
the target's still 2020. So are we expecting another business to sort of beat its targets
here or is there harder improvements to come in the future? And then following up from
an earlier question, I know you provide the net operating cash generation and it's very
strong number. Could you tell us sort of what goes on below the operating cash
generation, whether you have any one-off items in terms of remittances for disposals or
injections into other businesses here as well? Because it's very difficult to see or to get a
picture of the kind of movement in all of your cash position, then tell us – potentially tell us
maybe now or maybe at the Investor Day what the actual cash position is or the actual
stock on the balance sheet is. Thank you.

FINAL

See, on the cost, we are very happy we are able to achieve the target with two years in
advance compared to the initial plan. I remember that at the beginning, we said we would
achieve those €200 million of cost reduction in the major markets by 2019. Then last year,
we decided to anticipate one year and finally we're able to achieve thanks to the strong
actions of all the business units, all the countries, we're able to achieve the target as soon
as 2017.
Doesn't change the target for 2018, so the target for 2018 is still valid. And definitely,
when we will disclose our new strategy in November, we will talk again about cost, but it
will be a different story. Talking about, I would say same thing about Asset Management,
yes, we are quite successful in 2017. As of today, we can confirm that we are confident we
will achieve the 2020 target of an additional net result of €550 million, so but we will
probably update you on those targets in – we will update you on those targets in
November.

With respect to the net operating cash generation, that simply takes into account the
remittance from the subsidiaries and then it also takes into account the results at the
parent company in terms of reinsurance net of its expenses. So this year, there was – you
also have available on our webpage the individual accounts of the parent company this
year. We had better underwriting results on the reinsurance activities of the parent
company that contributes to the increase in cash. And there were some smaller interest
expenses and some cost savings, but you will see that part of the improvement in cost
savings achieved by the group was achieved at the holding company although I wouldn't
say this was terribly material in the overall amount of the net operating cash generated.
That's – those drivers are basically the same every year. This year, you have a better
reinsurance result and a better remittance.

FINAL

Thank you, Phillip. Luigi, if I could follow up on the cash generation, I'm more looking
towards the non-operating items. So I don't want to see the gross remittances. I want to
see the sort of net remittances. If there's any capital injections into business and as you
have achieved more than half of your disposal target, there's €0.5 billion, I guess, coming
into parent company as well from non-operating items.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Right. I can see where your question is coming from – I don't think I can answer your
question based on disclosure. I can answer your question based on quality development
obviously, like any group in which you have a parent company centralizing the Treasury
movements. Clearly, there is a use of cash from the parent company in order to finance
growth as subsidiaries; it doesn't all – not all the cash stays there. It goes back into the
business, that's one of the reasons for which obviously, like in any other group, we have
the role of the parent company. Unfortunately, in terms of figures I have, using disclosure,
it's more difficult for me to answer you precisely in terms of numbers.

line is open.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Fantastic. Thank you very much and well done for delivering on track, this is so lovely. On
the dividend, I think the way I'd put it to your colleagues earlier this morning is, you seem
to have had a cappuccino moment when you decided on growth in the dividend, when
the cash flow, et cetera, was more like an espresso moment and I just wondered if that is
indeed the case, you kind of felt, very well (00:43:16), let's go easy here. That's the figure
which really kind of stands out. On the LTIPs, I received this email last night. I wonder if you
can explain this LTIPs, is it new and is it relating to the new business plan, which will be
announced in November or is it the – does it reset – does it set now or does it set
tomorrow?
And on the Generali Leben, last year in 2016 from the SFCR report, one could see that
Generali Leben absorbed €155 million of cash, it was from the embedded value, not the
SFCR. And I just wondered what the figure was in 2017 as to kind of try and guess what
could be the consequence ultimately of either moving to runoff or disbursing of this unit?
And then finally on the cash, there seems to be a lot of cash in the group that is not in the
parent. I just wondered where it is, so the parent cash seems to have gone down quite a
bit; so it's gone down from €7.5 billion to €6.8 billion; this is the figures on page 86. The
group figure of cash consolidated has gone up from €10 billion to €13 billion. And I just
wondered maybe you can give a little bit of feeling and I know it's qualitative and I

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Michael. I didn't – quite because the sound comes across not
entirely clear. But let's say answering your first question, I would say using your tone, we
are brewing our dividend slowly. So it's very sad we're (00:45:05) using a different brew
than the one you have in mind. No, jokes aside. Our dividends are, at this moment,
reflecting our strategic pronouncements about that. So we are delivering in accordance to
that. And this year, the dividend is aligned to that. We have a commitment that runs out
next year and with respect to our dividend policy going forward, we will be updating you
at the Investor Day. I would say that all in all, frankly comparing our pay-outs to that of our
peers, I would say it's been a pretty good cup of coffee so far. So whether it's an
espresso or cappuccino, it tastes good so far.
In terms of your second question, I'm sorry, but the noise was kind of – it wasn't exactly
clear. Could you repeat it please?

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Sure, of course. So, last night, there was an email which I received saying that you've got
an LTIP program and I just wondered this LTIP program, does it price yesterday, does it
price tomorrow? Is it based on the new strategic plan, is it the old strategic plan? In a
funny way, in London when always things (00:46:28) is the management setting itself
target of starting today going forward or is it today looking backwards, just to try and
understand what this relates to? And the email was sent by Media – Generali Media

Q - Michael Huttner

Yes, that's correct. Yeah.

A - Luigi Lubelli

Yeah, well, but that's an ordinary announcement we do with the AGM. This forms part of

So in terms of the cash in the group, of course, I mean, making judgments of what is the
cash and where it is based on a snapshot at a given date is always risky, right, in the sense
that that's just a picture of the – of one day which is the day where you close the balance
sheet. Bear also in mind that we have two kinds of cash. We have the operating cash and
the cash which pertains to policyholders and these figures are put together in the figures
of our (00:48:24) cash.

Bloomberg Transcript

Generally speaking, I would say, because I think this is a question that came up in from
other analysts and thank you for that. I think that what can be said at large is that clearly
the group is focusing on generating more cash. I mean, all our activities are conducive to
that. We are writing a business that is more cash-generative than it was in the past. We
are cutting on expenses. So – and also, we are increasingly focusing on moving this cash
and having this cash moved from below to above. So I think that, say, beyond what the
figures because a figure at year end is informative only to a point. I would say that the
actions we are undertaking are clearly all conducive firstly to a larger cash generation and
secondly to a better upstreaming of that cash.
I have to say also the fourth question, you must forgive me, I didn't get it very well.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Yeah. So, Generali Leben. When I looked at the embedded value report for that subsidiary
last year, there was a €155 million injection of cash and capital and I understand that came
from its two sister companies (00:49:49) and Cosmos. And I just wondered what the
figure was in 2017. And the reason I ask is to better understand what will be the
consequence of closing the business – the company to new business and/or selling it off ?

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Right. I think you are maybe referring to the SFCR. So, we don't have had yet any updated
disclosure on that. But generally speaking, I mean, there wasn't any irrelevant movement
on Generali Leben in this year in this regard. But of course, in terms of figures, I don't have
any disclosure to back my statements.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I think just a general observation perhaps and all
my questions are in the context of this observation. I think we may be getting to the point
where it will be interesting to discuss your philosophy, whether you would prefer share
buybacks or whether you would prefer M&A? And the reason I say this – and this is
(00:51:05) my question set in, you seem to be generating a lot of cash, which is also not,
strictly speaking, operating in nature. So the question [Technical Difficultly] (00:51:12 to
00:51:17) which are very high in the second half...

A - Philippe Donnet

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Oh, okay.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

(00:51:23) cash not necessarily operating, that's where we lost you.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Okay. Cool. Yeah. So these things such as now, examples of what I see to be nonoperating cash. So first in the P&C segment, that is strong reserve releases in both
second half this year and second half last year. And Luigi, I heard of course your
comments on this. So my first question is, what do you think the broad dynamics are here?
You are clearly very well reserved in P&C. So do you see some excess reserves in that
segment which you are allowing to release over time, contributing to, what I call, nonoperating cash?
And the second example of non-operating cash has emerged this year in the form of the
repayment of internal debt in France of around €0.2 billion, I think you mentioned that on
one of the slides. So again, my question is broader in dynamics here. Do you think that is
going to continue, not necessarily in France, but elsewhere, is your capital management of
the group going to be of a type that you are going to identify excess debt positions held
in surplus capital at the local entities? Are you going to upstream this and is that going to
be part of the strategy to be revealed on November 21? So that was question number
two, if you're still with me. And this all leads into one general point which I'd like to explore
with you which is, if all of this is happening, we can expect good strong ongoing cash
momentum. What are you going to do with this cash? This year, you appear to have paid
out a lower proportion of the overall cash generated than last year. Is this caution because
you're trying to hold back some cash in a central liquidity pool? Are you going to gear up
for M&A? How are you going to deploy this cash in the future? What is your preference,
higher dividends, share buybacks, M&A? I hope that wasn't too long, but that's the sort of
framework I'd like to explore.

FINAL

A - Philippe Donnet

{BIO 4657671 <GO>}

Well, Ralph, I'm going to answer quite briefly to your question on our philosophy and
telling you what we're going to do this year. First of all, we are paying a dividend which is
increasing by 6% compared to last year. It's a significant improvement of the dividend, the
dividend yield is quite high. And definitely, we can confirm that we will achieve the initial
target of paying at least €5 billion of dividends by the end of 2018. On top of this, this
year, because I am happy to comment what's going to happen this year. This year, we're
going to pay back the two maturities of the subordinated debt for a total amount of €250
million and we're going to pay back this as a cash payment with no refinancing of these
and then to – we'll be happy to exchange with you on the buyback M&A debt and capital
on November 21, in Milan, because this is definitely, this will be definitely a significant part
of our new strategic plan.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Okay, that's lovely. Thank you. Just as a follow-up, in P&C, in the P&C reserve releases, do
they reflect a position that you are very comfortably, if not, over-reserved in P&C, now
you're planning to release similar sorts of amount sustainably in future?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Right. I was just about to answer that your question was not (00:56:05). The – look, firstly I
disagree on the non-operating nature of the cash in the sense that of those movements
because you may call it a difference in timing. I mean it's that the fact that you have
reserved claim and then you later pay a claim and then the claim turns out to be slightly
less than what you reserved it for, to me is 100% operating, there's nothing non-operating
in that, then we may have an interpretation of that, but that's simply the ordinary activity
of running a Non-Life business.
So to me it's absolutely 100% non-operating, but then perceptions and opinions
fortunately are free. I think that – but certainly that's the way how I see it. So, there is no
such thing as a plan to release the reserves. We have a reserve in position. We told you
that the group is well reserved. You have, I trust, plenty of information in our Annual
Report where you can check how our Non-Life business develops. You have consistently,
year-after-year triangles, which show you that this is not chance. This is simply a group that
runs its operations well and we handle our claims well and that's nothing more I can say or
would say about that. It's simply that we are running our Non-Life business well and
there's no plan nor anything in that respect.
Likewise, is the repayment of debt in France non-operating? I suspect if they can do it is
because their operations are running well, right. So they're not generating their cash out
of the year. They're generating cash from their operations. They – it's a well-run company.
Actually, it allows me to make a mention about France because France I think this year,
especially on the Life side, but also on the Non-Life side is one of the major, if not, the
major turnaround that we're showing in our accounts. So the fact that they find
themselves in a better technical position, hence generating more operating cash and in a
better Solvency position, to me, sounds in nature all operating. But as I say, this is a matter
of perception.

Well, you are asking me for a forecast, which I will not give at this point, in the sense, if
you're asking me the question is our reserve position comfortable? The answer is
absolutely yes. Are we going to, going forward, as I said in the beginning, seek to
optimize the capital position of our subsidiaries and if there's an opportunity to do so,
make upstreams? Not of the same – necessarily of the same kind, but anyway, an
optimization of the capital employed in our companies with the – within upstream towards
the parent, the answer also is yes. To what extent there's going to – but what I cannot

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Well, hi there. I'll try and keep it brief. First question, just on debt, in terms of the metrics
you look at, you mentioned in the slide pack the Solvency II headroom, which obviously is
a considerable €11 billion, but at the same time, you've decided to redeem that. So I'm
right in thinking, you're not just looking at a Solvency II headroom, but you're also still
Page 19 of 24



Company N ame: Assicuraz ioni Generali SpA

taking into account straight IFRS leverage and/or straight IFRS interest cover. Is that how I
should think about it, so you're balancing all three, just to clarify?

FINAL

Second question, Italian P&C growth (01:01:07) less in the second half, considerably less,
is this a price effect or is it a commercial effort effect on new business, just clarify that?
And a final simple question, tax. Your tax rate was inflated this year in 2017 because you
had some negative one-offs, particularly France and U.S. Some of those one-offs related
to the fact that ongoing tax rates are coming down. I think you've guided to €34.5 million
as a kind of average tax rate for the group. Can that start to fall or am I looking realistically
not before sort of 2020? Thanks.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Okay. Good afternoon, Andrew, or good morning I should say. The metrics we look at,
yes, the – let's say the – like last year, this year, that slide on the presentation is meant to
illustrate our flexibility, not necessarily that we're going to use it. What it tells you, I think
there are two very relevant qualitative development this year is that our tiering has been
reinforced, especially in Tier 1, unrestricted Tier 1. So that was a very welcome, I would say,
qualitative development in the composition of our Solvency II capital.

Bloomberg Transcript

Obviously, the fact that we have Solvency II doesn't mean at all that we have forgotten
the IFRS accounts. So – and the measure is based on the IFRS accounts. We continue to be
a rated entity and we continue to have a dialogue with the debt capital market; so of
course, we continue to look at leverage and interest coverage measures.
Regarding your second question, it was primarily a price effect in the last quarter in Italy.
And regarding the third question, actually thank you for asking that because the tax rate is
complex and easy at the same time, let's say. Last year, we had a positive impact from –
primarily from nonrecurring amounts in Germany and that lowered the rates. So if you
grossed up that rate last year to the rate this year, you would come to figures that are
more in line. So what happens on this backdrop? You have the two amounts of the U.S.
and France. If you strip those out, you will have a tax rate that is going down by about 50
basis points kind of, in the region of. That is largely related to the reduction of the
corporate tax rate in Italy IRES; that went down this year from 27.5% to 24%. So overall, our
tax rate has fallen this year. I mean, the ongoing tax rate, the underlying tax rate has fallen
by about 50 bps.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

And will it fall further, particularly because there was tax reform in France as well?

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

Well, yes. I was referring to France to the one-off. Yes France, there was this year a oneoff of about 10 percentage points. Then it's going of course, well hopefully I would say, to
fall next year – it's what is planned. And later on, there is also a continued corporate tax
reduction in France. So, yes in France, it will continue to fall.

We have not quite published the figure of a normal rate. I think we're about, the balance

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

Q - Niccolò C. Dalla Palma
Hi, good morning to everyone. Three questions for me. First one, a quick one on the
reinsurance result in the operating cash generation. Could you just explain what drove the
increase and what's the sustainable number, if there is any? But just to understand the big
jump on that. Secondly, on your non-operating results, just wondered if you could help us
understanding some of the components and it's quite, when you break it out, it's quite
easy to see the investment part of it, the holding expenses part of it.
But then there's the net other non-operating expenses. Of that, you disclose how much is
(01:06:29), how much is restructuring, how much is the UK runoff portfolio sale? And then
you were still left with €225 million negative. What is that? What – where are those costs
coming from and is that a running number or can that change? Lastly, I was wondering one
of your peers disclosed the future profits included in the available financial resources for
Solvency II. I want to know whether you could give us a similar indication or whether it is
somewhere or maybe I haven't spotted that yet. Thank you.

Good afternoon, Niccolò. So let me just gather a few slides so that I can guide you, just
bear with me for a moment. While I look for the figure, in terms of the reinsurance impact,
reinsurance impact was simply due to the fact that the – primarily the weather-related
claims this year impacted on the parent company less than the previous year. Let's say, to
explain it otherwise, where they occur, they occur to, in amounts that were below the
threshold that would lead to a session to the parent company and that's why that
happened.
So is it recurring, is it not recurring? I would say, if I have to judge by past year's figures,
the figures is a bit on the high side, I would say, if that answers your question, but really I
don't have a forecast for that. So now, let's see, your question is about the net other nonoperating expenses. So there, I would say, it's indicated in the slide that the main impact is
here, is from the restructuring in Germany; that's the biggest element that makes it swing
with respect to last year. There is a minor reduction in the VOBA amortization that's
because, but I think this is so low, it's almost inconsequential for the group. We had a
goodwill that we – of VOBA that we stopped amortizing. We finished amortizing last year.
So it's impacting less than that and indeed, we are...

Q - Niccolò C. Dalla Palma
It must be the other non-recurring items if you exclude the UK runoff ?

Yeah, if you exclude the UK runoff, it is at a similar level to last year. It's basically the same
amount because if you add that up, you have a €220 million, I think last year the figure
was €200 million. And basically there, we have sundry expenses largely related to IT
restructurings of this kind of items, there were several items of that kind.

Q - Niccolò C. Dalla Palma
Okay.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

It's more or less the similar figure as a year ago.

Q - Niccolò C. Dalla Palma
And on the VIS or future profits in AFR, if you do have an indication or...?

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

We don't have – I think the figures that you will find similar to that is in the SFCR. You will
find a disclosure that is kind of along those lines if I understand your question. In IFRS or
own funds?

No, sorry in the own funds. So we're trying to understand if you could reconcile how much
was the future profits, we can of course have some thumb rule by looking at what the
tangible equity is, but...?

I'm afraid in our disclosure, we've not precisely split the number out. I mean you can...

Q - Niccolò C. Dalla Palma
Okay.

A - Luigi Lubelli

{BIO 4108780 <GO>}

...you can kind of, I think, surmise it looking at the figures, but explicitly, it is not broken out.

Q - Niccolò C. Dalla Palma
Okay. Thank you.
