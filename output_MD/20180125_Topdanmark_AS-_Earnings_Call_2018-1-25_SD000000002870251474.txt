Welcome to the presentation of Topdanmark's results for 2017. Proﬁt was DKK
1,733,000,000, up from DKK 1,536,000,000 in 2016. The combined ratio improved from
85.1 to 82. Premiums increased 1.4% in nonlife and 11% in life. For 2018, the assumed
combined ratio remains unchanged at between 90 and 91, excluding runoﬀ. Similarly, we
continue to assume positive growth in nonlife for 2018. The proﬁt forecast model for 2018
is between DKK 950 million and DKK 1,050,000,000, excluding runoﬀ.

Finally, the Board of Directors will recommend to the AGM a payment of dividends of DKK
1,710,000,000 for 2017. This corresponds to payout ratio of 99%. And a dividend yield of
7.4%. These are the main points in my presentation.
Pretax earnings increased DKK 293 million to DKK 2,235,000,000 in 2017. And technical
nonlife proﬁt increased DKK 302 million to DKK 1,622,000,000. The increase was due to
an extraordinary favorable claims trend and eﬃciency improvements. Investment return
decreased DKK 104 million to DKK 288 million. As in 2016, the investment return in 2017
were signiﬁcantly higher than the level assumed in the forecast.
Proﬁt in life insurance increased DKK 60 million to DKK 249 million, primarily due to high
investment return and improved results of sales and administration.
The claims trend was 65.8, an improvement of 2.9percentage points compared to 2016.
Adjusted for runoﬀ gains, weather-related claims and large-scale claims, the claims trend
improved by 2.7percentage points. The improved claims trend was, among other things,
due to an improved trend in the SME segment and in theft as well as a favorable impact of
Topdanmark's eﬃciency improvement program.
Premiums increased 1.4% in nonlife, reﬂecting a 1.4% increase in both the Personal and the
SME segment.
2017 was characterized by a net increase in the number of customers in Personal,
Agricultural and the SME markets. During 2017, we stated that the large -- last and largescale customer had left at the end of 2016. This has had a negative impact of 0.6% in 2017
on premiums for the Topdanmark group.

FINAL

The average premiums in motor insurance declined 1.1%. Despite an increase in the
number of cars insured, motor premiums declined, reducing Topdanmark's total
premiums by 0.1%. For 2018, we continue to assume a positive premium growth.
As stated, the combined ratio was 82 in 2017, compared to 85.1 in the year before. For
2018, we continue to assume a combined ratio of between 90 and 91, excluding runoﬀ.
This still includes additional expenses of between 0.5 and 1percentage point due to the
investment in increased digitalization and automation.
Proﬁt in the life company increased DKK 60 million to DKK 249 million, primarily due to a
high investment return and improved results of sales and administration. For 2017, the
assumed proﬁt for the life insurance group is between DKK 240 million and DKK 270
million.
In life, company holds a good competitive position. This was reﬂected in an 11% increase
in premiums, split between a 16% growth in single premiums and a 2.1% growth in the
regular premiums. The termination of Topdanmark's distribution agreements with
Nykredit and Sydbank within life insurance results in an assumed decline for 2018 in
regular premiums of around 5%.

The investment return for the Topdanmark group, excluding life, was DKK 396 million.
This included the results of Topdanmark's asset management company of DKK 130
million.
Despite the investment return in Q4 being DKK 82 million lower compared to Q4 last
year, the investment return in Q4 this year was higher than usually assumed.
Based on a number of assumptions describing the Q4 report, the assumed post-tax proﬁt
for 2018 will be between DKK 950,000,00 and DKK 1,050,000,000, excluding runoﬀ.
In Q1 report, the Board of Directors presented a new earnings distribution policy. It was
stated that we will retain our disciplined approach of capital consumption and avoiding
accumulation of unnecessary capital. It was also stated that the basis for the dividend
scheme is a payout ratio of at least 70%. Given Topdanmark's solid funds, the Board of
Directors will recommend to the AGM a dividend payment of DKK 1,710,000,000. The
recommended dividend represents a payout ratio of 99% and a dividend yield of 7.4.
