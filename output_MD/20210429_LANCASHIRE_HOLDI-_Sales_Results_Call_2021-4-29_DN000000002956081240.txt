Hello and welcome to Lancashire Holdings Limited First Quarter 2021 Results. Throughout
the call, all participants will be in listen-only mode and afterwards there will be a Q&A
section. Please note this call is being recorded.
Today, I'm pleased to present Alex Maloney, Group CEO; Paul Gregory, Group COO;

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone. We'll now go to our investor
presentation. So if you can please note our safe harbor statement. The Q1 highlights. In
Q1, we have generated our strongest ever gross written premium. We have
demonstrated our ability and willingness to deploy additional capital into the hardened
market, which is in line with our long-term strategy.

FINAL

We are still declining more business than we are writing. The current opportunity means
you have to seek the best business and remain disciplined on rate adequacy, not headline
rate changes solely. Our focus is on the aggregate rate change we have seen since 2017
across the majority of our portfolio. The RPI we have seen is in line with our expectations,
but the opportunity set is up.
Our Q1 underwriting performance. Winter Storm Uri is in line with management's
expectations for a loss of this size. It's historically higher cat loss to have in Q1, which is a
reminder for the industry that great momentum needs to continue. On COVID, our loss
estimate remains unchanged. Little change -- we're seeing a little change in our claims
data. We're still pushing any suggestion about the maturity of this loss as we are still
moving through COVID. But we are comfortable with our number and any change to our
COVID loss does not derail our strategy. Absent Uri, all our underlying performance looks
strong, and our strategy is on track.

Bloomberg Transcript

On capital. During the quarter, we had a highly successful debt raise, which provides
efficient capital, which is all the way an agency qualifying. Therefore, we have sufficient
headroom for our budgeted growth throughout 2021. On investments, our investment
portfolio is in line with management's expectations, where we will remain short duration.
We go to Slide 4, please, Jelena. We are taking advantage of the harder market, and our
sole focus is to maximize ROE. We look to manage our business across all stages of the
underwriting cycle to maximize fully converted book value per share. This means that we
will aggressively grow at this point of the cycle and retreat when the balance of the
underwriting opportunity wanes. Every action we take is to improve investor returns over
the long term.
On diversification, our diversification into new lines of business is solely to improve
returns. Each product line has to produce acceptable standalone results. Diversification is
a byproduct, not a driver for us. Less volatile capital-light product lines can be written at
higher combined ratios and still generate attractive returns.
Since 2018, we have continued to build out our product suite as the underwriting
opportunity improves. Our focus is on underwriting talent, the right underwriting returns
and culture. We remain disciplined, but the opportunity set is up, and we expect to
continue to grow whilst returns continue to improve. When looking at our business, we are
seeing acquisition ratios declining as the underwriting opportunity improves. And our
expense ratio is also declining as we grow. Our current strategy improves our combined
ratio.
Slide 5, please, Jelena. Slide 5 demonstrates we've been patient during the soft part of
the insurance cycle, where we have grown the under -- we have been improving
underwriting opportunity since 2017 in line with our long-term strategy. We will continue to
grow, whilst the underwriting opportunity remains strong, and our DNA of the business
remains unchanged.
I'll now hand over to Paul.

{BIO 16314515 <GO>}

Thank you, Alex. If we could move to Slide 6, please, Jelena. As Alex has noted, we're
extremely happy with our top line premium growth in Q1. Market conditions were in line
with our expectations. This has allowed us to deploy the capital we raised in the lines of
businesses we had targeted for growth, as rating moves to a level were far more
business reach rating accuracy. Each segment continues to show positive rate momentum
with a portfolio of RPI of 112%.
We're now in the fourth year of cumulative rate improvement. In many of our product
lines, we are at attractive rating levels that allows us to speed up the rate of growth. And
we have the capital available to support this. Within the P&C reinsurance segment, every
class has delivered growth. In line with our strategy, the majority of Q1 premium growth in
this segment has been driven by the proxy reinsurance lines.

Bloomberg Transcript

We've delivered substantial growth in both property catastrophe reinsurance and
property retrocession, with both these classes demonstrating double-digit rate
improvement. This growth is from new business, increased rates and growing our
relationship with existing clients. Also within the P&C reinsurance segment, we started to
underwrite casualty reinsurance, specialty reinsurance and accident and health. All three
classes have started the year well, and we are confident in achieving at least the upper
end of the $40 million to $60 million guidance previously provided.
For the property insurance segment, we have grown the property D&F insurance portfolio
as rates continue their upward trajectory, and we deploy more capital across both the
Lloyd's and company platform into this class. D&F growth offset by premium reductions in
terrorism and political risk classes. Market conditions here remain stable, before the flat
rating environment, but the reduction in premium is driven by the political risk book where
the majority of risks are one-off in nature, and there is no renewal pattern, which means
we can have lumpy premium quarters. This is also a class that is linked to economic activity
levels. So, we expect some demand pickup as the world gradually recoveries.
The energy segment continues to see premium growth given the continuing maturity of
the power and downstream energy portfolios, which is helped by a favorable rating
environment as momentum in these sub classes continues. We've also grown our energy
liability portfolio as this subclass also experiences strong rate improvement. Within
upstream energy, it remains less dedicated, albeit still positive, and our appetite here
remains relatively stable. Both the marine and aviation segments have seen year-on-year
premium reduction. In both instances, this is purely down to timing. In aviation, where Q1 is
traditionally a quiet quarter anyway, there are a small number of contracts that are due for
renewal later in the year. In marine, there were a small number of large premium multiyear contracts written in Q1 last year, not due for renewal in 2021.
Market conditions in both aviation and marine remain favorable continued great
momentum and our outlook for 2021 premium growth in both segments remains positive,
whilst acknowledging the potential demand headwinds that make -- that are likely to
impact the aviation market later in the year.

FINAL

In marine, we'll be expanding our marine liability offering when our new underwriter joins
us later this year albeit the premium -- the top line premium impact will not start to be
seen until 2022. As ever, we continue to assess new underwriting opportunities all the
time and if we can bring in an additional underwriting talent to the group that can improve
our underwriting return over time then we will do so.
Turning to Slide 7. Our business mix between high and low attrition business can change
given that we grow and shrink our top line quite dramatically given underlying a market
conditions. Market conditions in some of the specialty insurance lines with higher attritional
loss ratios, such as aviation, energy and marine, started to improve more favorably and at
a greater pace than other areas of the portfolio. So, we grew into this favorable market
and as such, the business mix shifted.
To reiterate what we have always said, we are agnostic as to what the mix is. The focus is
to maximize the return on capital from underwriting and each product line can run at a
different loss ratio, while still being accretive to the underwriting return on capital. Before I
turn over to Natalie, I just wanted to give a quick update on the Japanese property cat
renewals.
I'm pleased with the rate increases we were able to achieve and the new business
volumes we saw, which allowed us to further grow our Japanese portfolio. We've had a
longstanding relationships with our Japanese clients, and we continue to support them as
they look to buy more capacity.

I'll now hand it over to Natalie.

Natalie Kershaw

{BIO 21394441 <GO>}

Thanks, Paul. Hi, everybody, I'm going to talk through some slides on our business mix and
also capital. If we can go to Slide 8, Jelena. Following on from what Paul had said about
changes to business mix, Slide 8 gives some further details around the relative benefits of
different lines of business. Where lines have heavy exposure to catastrophe losses, there
is a high capital charge due to the volatile nature of the business written.
The benefit of this type of business is that the underlying attritional losses are low, and
therefore, in light catastrophe years can be very profitable. When you look at the more
attritional lines, they are much less volatile and require significantly less capital. However,
as long as these lines are profitable, they are accretive to return. Building a more diverse
book of business with some new more attritional lines that are still profitable gives us a
statable earnings stream. Higher volumes of business also increased premium earnings
over time, leading to lower expense ratio.
The relatively wide guidance on the attritional ratio of 35% to 40% that I gave last quarter,
and as noted on this slide, is due to two main factors. Firstly, our business mix can change
quickly as market conditions change, affecting the underlying rate of attrition. And as we
enter new lines, we tend to reserve conservatively as we get comfortable with our
performance.
Page 4 of 18



Company N ame: L ancashire H oldings L td
Company Ticker: L RE L N Equity
Date: 2021-04-29

FINAL

Secondly, our traditional specialty lines, such as marine and energy, are exposed to a
regular, larger losses, such as (inaudible) sinking oil rig exposures and so on, which could
have a material impact on the attritional loss ratio in the period in which they occur. As we
have always said, our focus is on ROE as measured by the change in fully converted book
value per share, and we look to delever and increase return to shareholders at all times.
We tend to be agnostic on business mix.
Moving on to capital, starting on Slide 9. There are two main points to note on this slide.
Firstly, flexible capital management has always been a cornerstone of our strategy and
reflects our capital depending on the underwriting conditions that we see in the market.
This has meant we have returned $2.9 billion to shareholders since inception, including the
current final dividend payment. But in the last few years, as rates have increased, we have
retained capital within the business and have raised both equity capital and additional
debt capital to fund underwriting growth.

Bloomberg Transcript

Secondly, the chart on this slide shows that AM Best is our most constraining capital
requirement. We always aim to keep some headroom over this requirement. The
quantum of headroom is flexible depending on market conditions, but generally position
for us to withstand a reasonable cat loss and maintain adequate capital post the event to
take advantage of any subsequent rate hardening.
Moving on to Slide 10. Slide 10 gives a bit more flavor around our strong capital position.
Our capital adequacy is measured by AM Best on their standard model is higher for return
period, and as the chart shows, it's higher than the peer average. One reason for this is
that we monitor capital against the AM Best cat stress model rather than the standard
model. And this requires a one in 100 year Worldwide All Perils PML to be deducted from
capital. As we write a relatively high proportion of cat business, this reduces our available
capital under AM Best considerably.
More importantly, we hold a conservative capital provision, such that post-event we can
react quickly and continue to write business. This enables one of our key strategic aims to
operate nimbly through the cycle. Our recent successful debt issuance has improved our
capital position as all our debt is now allowable under all the rating agency and regulatory
model. While previous debt was not allowable capital for the BMA, so the issuance gives a
significant boost to our regulatory capital position, which is further detailed on Slide 11.
On Slide 11, the waterfall chart shows how our regulatory capital position has developed
since the end of 2019 and includes the pro forma 2021 position, incorporating the debt
raise and anticipated new business in 2021. To be clear, the 2019 and 2020 ratio do not
include any debt capital. Most importantly, this diagram shows that we still maintain a
strong regulatory capital position following a one in 100 year Gulf of Mexico wind events.
We expect our BMA solvency ratio to be comfortably above 200% going forward
depending on market conditions.
To sum up, whilst our attritional loss ratio may move around quarter-to-quarter and yearon-year, our focus remains the same, to deliver an increased ROE for our shareholders,
which is now supported by the better underwriting environment, Paul has just talked

about. Active capital management remains a cornerstone of our strategy, and we remain
strongly capitalized.
And with that, I'll pass it back to Alex.

Slide 13, please, Jelena. To summarize this quarter, we are executing on our long-term
strategy. Our growth continues to improve by cross cycle returns. We are well capitalized
for the opportunity we see, but the DNA of the business remains unchanged.
We will now go to the operator for questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Freya Kong from Bank of
America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Freya Kong

{BIO 20097488 <GO>}

Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions. I've got two please. First question,
you've typically not disclosed your ECR with your results. Is this something that you will
look to incorporate more going forward. And is there any sort of ECR level that you can
guide us to that would be comparable to your minimum BCAR tolerance. And second
question on Slide 10, it looks like you're operating at 60% on your standard BCAR formula.
So, maybe on a stress basis closes -- closer to 50% -- of 55%, which is obviously quite a
large buffer on top of that 10% tolerance. What should this ratio look like in a more normal
year? Thanks.

Hi Freya. It's Natalie. Can you just repeat question two, please, the second question?

FINAL

Q - Freya Kong

{BIO 20097488 <GO>}

Yeah, sure. So on Slide 10, you guys show you that on the 99.6 standard BCAR, you
operate at about 60%. So, I think maybe on a stress basis, you're closer to 50%. That's
still quite a big buffer above that 10% tolerance that you managed to. So, what sort of
buffer should we look for in a normal year? Thanks.

A - Natalie Kershaw

{BIO 21394441 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks, Freya. So taking that second question first. As I've said in my remarks, we
have to reduce our available capital by one in 100 Worldwide All Perils PML and that's
quite a significant amount of capital to reduce by for the stressed BCAR. So I would say
we're lower than the 50% you're suggesting on that.
And then on the ECR, going forward, yes, we'll do the same kind of disclosure around this
time of year. We have to submit our ECR to the BMA by the end of May. So this quarter is
a good time to publish our ECR going forward. We're not in a position to disclose how the
ECR equates to the AM Best ratio. But as I've said, we look to be significantly higher than
the 200% going forward.

Okay, thanks.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous.
Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Paul, hi there, thanks for the presentation and the capital disclosure today. Three quick
ones, I think. Alex, you said at the beginning, the RPI was in line, but the opportunity set
was up. I just -- I didn't quite know what you meant? I mean, are you referring year-on-year
or relative to when you last talked to us in Q4? Just -- I didn't quite -- if you could just color
those two statements, that would be helpful.
Second question, of the new lines that you're growing in, and you said you're putting up
more conservative loss picks, understandably, what's the kind of seasoning period we
would expect for those new lines? I know they're longer tail than cat, but I don't think the
nature of them is that long tail. So, what's the kind of seasonal period where you would
say, okay, now we can relax those loss picks?
And the final question, you provide on Slide 11 a scenario analysis with a stress scenario of
a one in 100 for Gulf of Mexico. What would that -- I don't think that one on 100 has been
updated for growth. What would it be roughly if I updated for growth that you expect to
put in '21?

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Thank you. And yeah, on point one, just to clarify what I was trying to say. During the
first quarter, the price of our insurance portfolio was in line with our expectations. So, it
wasn't actually what it was and if it's in line. And I think we previously mentioned that.
I think what we're trying to say when we say the opportunity set is up is we just saw a lot
more business. And the main reason the fact is when you're in the (Technical Difficulty)
marketing, the broker has the market (Technical DIfficulty). And therefore, you've got
more business is done (Technical DIfficulty) just seeing more business and that very much
what you saw during Q1. So the pricing is in line, the physical amount of business we saw
was definitely up. The opportunities we see across the base are up. And some of that is a
function of brokers marketing more heavily and pricing environment is going up.
(Technical DIfficulty) we just see more opportunity over time. That's the point I was trying
to make. Is that clear?

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Natalie Kershaw

{BIO 21394441 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Andrew, on point two on the new lines, we would say we would monitor it for around 3
years, depending on the lines business.

A - Paul Gregory

{BIO 16314515 <GO>}

Okay. And on your question 3, Andrew, we update our 1 -- publicly update our one in 100,
one in 250 in numbers at the half year. So, you'll see those are kind of next set of
earnings, why we're saying as is obvious, with the growth we've put on you would to be
expecting those catastrophe PMLs to be increasing given the additional new business
we've written, but also the proportionately we're buying less reinsurance than we were a
year ago. So, a the combination of the two, you'll see directionally those PMLs move up,
but you'll see the hard data in three months' time.

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kamran Hossain from RBC. Please
go ahead, your line is open.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Afternoon, everyone. First question is on, I guess, the business mix and the attritional loss
ratio. I really like the slide, which shows a split between attrition and kind of lower attrition
business. And I kind of understand the backward-looking story attritional focus lines
Page 8 of 18



Company N ame: L ancashire H oldings L td
Company Ticker: L RE L N Equity
Date: 2021-04-29

increased to 2020. And therefore, that ratio hasn't moved that much. I guess listening to
what you've done in 2021, the majority of growth in Q1 has been from reinsurance.

FINAL

And I assume that although you're planning to grow in casualty, the majority of that would
be from property-based classes, which I assume have relatively low attrition. So, just trying
to square that, should the attrition will therefore improve pretty sharply as this business
you've written at 1:1 or kind of within the first quarter and through?
And the second question is on, I guess, the growth for the remainder of the year. We saw
some of the reinsurers pull back in January. Do you think there will be a similar opportunity
to kind of grow, maybe not as much as you did in Q1, but do you think there'll be a similar
opportunity later in the year? Thank you.

A - Paul Gregory

{BIO 16314515 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi Kamran, I'll take these. So I think what's probably -- obviously, in Q1, you've seen a lot of
growth come through the property lines. I think, as you know, the bulk of our specialty
business renews Q2 and beyond, so we're definitely intending to continue to grow in
those areas. For example, we're still seeing good rate improvement in things like
downstream and energy and power. We expect to see continued improvement in things
like marine and aviation, as I covered off in my opening remarks.
So we've made the point, our attrition can swing dependent upon the book. That made
the statement and, obviously, our guidance remains the same. But the mix you see in Q1 is
different to what you'll see in the remainder of the year. In terms of kind of growth
expectations for Q2 and beyond. For long as I know, obviously, the business mix is a little
different than in Q1 with more specialty insurance renewing as a percentage of the
portfolio in Q2 and beyond.
That said, we certainly expect to grow our premiums ahead of rates. So as we always say,
we never enter any renewals or preconceived growth plans. Our decisions are going to
be driven by the opportunity that's in front of us. But because I've just said conditions in a
lot of these lines still remain favorable, we're seeing good rate adequacy in things like
property D&F, downstream energy and power. There's a lot of business renewed in Q2.
So, you would definitely expect us to grow there.
As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we had a very good Japanese renewal season.
We were very happy with the rates that we saw in our portfolio and the growth we
delivered. We've got Florida coming up. We'll see how that plays out. Again, if we get
price inadequacy, we would be more than happy to grow our portfolio there. As I said,
we'll always be driven by the opportunity. But at the moment, the rate momentum still
looks good.

{BIO 17001429 <GO>}

Hi, good afternoon. And just two questions from me please and first is in terms of Suez
Canal, could you just give a little bit color, it's probably still early days. If that's -- what sort
of exposure you're likely to get on that event? And my second question is around the rate
environment. And obviously, we've seen strong rates. I mean, based on your experience
and -- what's your outlook in terms of the sustainability of the current rate environment?
Thank you.

A - Paul Gregory

{BIO 16314515 <GO>}

Okay. I'll take -- so obviously, we don't have to comment on particular individual losses. But
what we can do, obviously, it's an incident that's very well known and being covered a lot
in the press and clearly going to create economic losses of some sorts. What is very
difficult at this stage, given it's very early, as you noted, is how that could, indeed, transfer
into possible insurance or reinsurance losses. It's just we're not at the stage yet where
anyone can put any kind of numbers around that. But it's an incident in the marine market
that potentially could get rights to claims, and it's something that we'll monitor as second
the quarter progresses.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

I think on rate change, we are confident that rate change continues through '21. And
maybe now, we still believe that there are a number of hurdles for the industry to tackle,
obviously COVID would be one. When the US court system opens again, when the world
is back to some sort of normality, I think the gap the investment returns we're currently
seeing so I think there's enough pressure in the system and enough need for returns for
investors that keep underwriters honest and rates improving through at least '21.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Iain Pearce from Credit Suisse.
Please go ahead, your line is open.

Q - Iain Pearce

{BIO 19522835 <GO>}

Hi, thanks for taking my questions. The first one was just on retro spend. I'm wondering if
you can sort of run us through the moving parts on retro spend. One, you sort of talked
about renewal of the core program at higher rates and then being able to renew some of
those peripheral programs. A lot of the growth has come in property, which I don't think is
the line of business that have those quota share programs on them. So I'm just wondering
sort of how we're expecting retro spend to move this year and how it's going to affect
retention rates?

Page 10 of 18

And then the second one is you talked about acquisition costs falling on some of the new
lines of business that you're entering into, I'm just wondering whether that fall in
acquisition cost is sufficient to offset the sort of move in the attritional loss ratio guidance
that you've given, so sort of from a combined ratio perspective, a net positive or not?

FINAL

A - Paul Gregory

{BIO 16314515 <GO>}

Hi, I'll take the first question on reinsurance spend. I think in dollar terms, and we might of
noted this, actually, last quarter. In dollar terms, because we're growing, and we've got
more lines of business, and we're writing proportionately more business. On the inwards
book, but on a dollar basis, our total reinsurance spend will go up. But as a proportion of
inward income, that percentage is going to go down.
And that's for a number of reasons. In the cat lines, as I noted earlier, we are taking more
risk on to our own balance sheet, whether that be retaining the little bit more of the
bottom of core programs, whether that be buying less quota share on some of those
areas of the portfolio, which is therefore, ultimately going to bring down our percentage,
and obviously, the inwards book growing.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the specialty lines, the protections we report are broadly in line with what we had last
year. There are a couple of protections coming up later in the year on certain classes of
business where we've seen positive rate improvement on the front end, which may lead
us to decide to take more risk and retain more risk. So we haven't yet made those
decisions. But at a high level, yes, dollar spend is will be up as a percentage, and
proportion will come down.

A - Natalie Kershaw

{BIO 21394441 <GO>}

Iain, it's Natalie. On your second question, on the acquisition cost, yes, there are benefits
from business mix, for example, the property line tend to have lower acquisition costs
than other line. So of course, we've obviously been an a property business, which gives
you the benefit on the acquisition cost ratio. You also tend to see, as underwriting
conditions improve, the impact from terms and conditions with the commissions also
reduce on other lines of business, which is beneficial.
And then also just to note that higher premium volumes also give us a positive impact for
G&A ratio. So, although we expect the dollar amount of expenses increased as we
continue increasing the underwriting team. The actual percentage as we said before,
we'd anticipate to come down to around 2016, 2017 levels. So, the overall impact on the
combined ratio, I would say, very much depends on the business mix and the amount of
businesses we are able to write this year.

Hi, there. Congratulations on a good set of results. Most questions have been answered,
but I just wanted to follow up on Kamran's question on business mix. It's a very detailed
answer, but what I don't quite get the grips with is it still feels like you've grown -- you're
set to grow quicker in lower attritional lines this year. Is that fair? And does that mean that
you're aiming for the bottom end of your attritional loss ratio guidance?
A question to -- as a general market question, it appears that in Florida, we continue to
see a higher frequency of litigations in the Florida homeowners' market. Also, you talk
about it being a very heavy hurricane season this year. Can you provide your views on
this? And how does that shape your 16/17 renewal strategy?
And final question is a very basic question. You talk about gross written premium growth.
How does that stack up on a net basis this -- in Q1? Thank you.

Okay. So I'll take the first on business mix. So we're very happy with where our guidance is
at the moment, and we do expect the dividend of 35% to 40% range. And that's where
we came in, as we said in our earnings update for Q1, so we're happy with that guidance.

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

With regards to Florida, I think absolutely you're right, I think since Hurricane Irma, lot of
lessons have been learnt between, we've seen a lot of claims and inflation come through.
I think like our litigation that you mentioned and it's certainly something when we're
looking at that risk. We try and price in as best we can (inaudible) our pricing for that.
In terms of listening to weather experts in terms of how many hurricanes there going to
be, in all honesty, that's not necessarily something that we factor into our underwriting.
There can be 100 hurricanes that you'd know that made landfalls and help drop the
scores, but that's something historically we've never really done. We look at pricing at -on an expected basis. And if we think we're being paid for the risk that we're taking on
then we're prepared to write that risk. But on the litigation point, absolutely, that's
something that the whole market in fairness has taken on board since Hurricane Irma.

On the next question, I think is -- Paul I think, said last quarter, we would expect our net
premiums written to increase more than our growth premiums written this year, although

the dollar amount that we spend may still be higher than last year.

A - Natalie Kershaw

(Multiple Speakers) gross written premium growth that you saw. Should we expect that
being higher amount on net written basis at this stage point?

Q - Jelena Bjelanovic

{BIO 16398596 <GO>}

Faizan, hi it's Jelena. Faizan, So just to reiterate what Paul and Natalie have already said,
we look at our business on a full-year basis. Just looking at the quarter in isolation doesn't
really help anyone. So if you look at it through the full year, as both Paul and Natalie have
said, our reinsurance spend level might go up a little bit, but the percentage of net versus
gross should go up.

Hi, there. Thank you. Most of my questions have been asked. So I just wanted to ask in
terms of how Lancashire Capital Management had started the year and whether you
would expect the Uri losses to have any implications in terms of the sort of returns that it
would generate. And secondly, just a boring numbers question, what is the cost of retiring
the non-qualifying debt going to be? Thank you.

A - Darren Redhead

{BIO 17995744 <GO>}

Hi, Ben, it's Darren. I'll take the question on LCM. How the year started? Very pleased, we
would say. Our portfolio is the best we've had since inception in a potential year to
investors, which was also about the rating environment. Regarding Uri, little to no impact
on the LCM portfolio due to the levels that we attach with our client customers.

Hi Ben, on your third question, we're going to retire all our historical debt this quarter. So it
should be gone by the Q2 releases. None of the subordinated debt that we've got has
got any penalties associated with it. However, there is a penalty on our senior debt, which
is basically the current value of the interest payment on that up until October 2022. So,
that will come in, in the region of around $10 million, which will be included in next
quarter's results.

Hello, hi, thanks for the kind of question. I have three questions, two are on capital one on
prior year development. So the first one, looking at Slide 11, it looks like you plan to deploy
alpha what you deployed in January throughout the rest of the year. How should we think
about growth? I know that it depends on rates and business up for renewal as well. So
perhaps, if you could give us an idea about what proportion of your business renewals in
June, July, April and so on, if you can give us a breakdown, that maybe would help.
And the second question, still on the same slide, what ECR ratio would you expect rating
agencies -- the rating converting agencies to fall below your decent level?
And then lastly, on prior year developments. You released nearly $5 million in the first
quarter. Would you reiterate the guidance that was given for the full year? And if you can
give us also an idea about the impact of new lines on PYD/

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Okay, hi Emanuele, on your first point, I think first point to make is, we certainly have -we're in a very strong capital position. So, we're definitely in a good position to grow for
the rest of the year. Worth remembering, and I mentioned this earlier in answer to some
of the other questions, that Q2 is more specialty insurance dominated. There are
obviously still cat renewal seasons in Q2, but we kind of moved back more towards
specialty and then later in the year, things like aviation, for example.
And they're a lot less capital-intensive. As I mentioned earlier, we're still seeing really
good rate momentum in a lot of our lines of business. So, I would fully anticipate to grow
ahead of the rating environment, which is what you would expect us to do at this stage of
the cycle. In terms of absolute numbers, we will underwrite the opportunity in front of us.

FINAL

As I said before, we won't go into any renewal season with preconceived ideas in the
market better than we think, and we'll grow more aggressively. It's in line with we grow in
line with plan. And to be honest, if it's not as good as we think, then we prepared to not
grow as much.
So sorry, it doesn't give you an exact answer to the level of growth, but where we see the
market now, where we see the rate adequacy for a number of our lines of business, I
would be expecting us to grow ahead the rating environment for the remainder of the
year.

A - Natalie Kershaw

{BIO 21394441 <GO>}

Hi Emanuele, it's Natalie. I referred an answer to the first question, we don't disclose our
rating agency capital requirements. Further, if you look at the Slide 9 with the chart on that
slide, which gives an indication of the relative capital requirement of AM Best and S&P
compared to the PFCR, so that may be able to give you a little bit of color on that.

Bloomberg Transcript

On prior year development, there's no change to our guidance of $40 million to $60
million of reserve releases for this year. As we've said previously especially, believe
reserve releases as an annual number as quarterly movements can be quite volatile. We
do often have low releases or even what appears as best development in Q1, as we can
(inaudible) coming through from the prior year. And then this comes to even out
throughout the year.
And just to note that we've never had a year of overall adverse development since our
inception. I think you had a further question on the new lines of business. Obviously, they
are new lines of business, so they're not going to impact any reserve releases this year.

Q - Nick Johnson

{BIO 1774629 <GO>}

Hi, good afternoon everybody. Just a question on the comments around strategy to
improve cross cycle returns. With new lines of business diversification, which is accretive to
returns, which makes sense, just wondered if you could say what your aspiration is in
terms of how many points that might add to cross cycle returns versus the old book of
business sort of prior to when you started to move into new lines, a few years ago. Thank
you.

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

So I think if you think about our strategy, it's very simple. And at this stage of the cycle, you
should expect us to grow materially as we have done in Q1. I think the new lines of
business are a function of two things. One, if you look at the new lines of business we've
entered since 2018, pretty much tracks when rates across most class of business

Page 15 of 18

FINAL

improved. And as you know, during the soft market years, we contemplated the
opportunities, but we just couldn't get the numbers to work.
So I don't think anyone should really be confused with a material change in strategy. I think
we're just finding more classes of business that make sense. And obviously, as you know,
we're not really fussed on the makeup of the book, but we are fussed on improving our
returns and growing. And the benefit of some of the front lines we've added is that you
will give diversification, but that's, as I said, a by-product of -- a handy by-product of the
class of business. And we're just not obsessed with the makeup of that portfolio, but
every single thing we do is to look to improve our long-term returns.
So I think it's quite hard to compare it to our old book of business because the Company
has changed a lot. And obviously, we're moving Lancashire forward, but the DNA of the
business and why we're doing this hasn't changed at all. And everything we're doing, we
believe will improve our ROE over the long term.
So for me, this is all perfectly logical in the market we're in. And over time, the market
gets better and improves, we will grow with the opportunity, and then at some point,
when the other part of the cycle obviously starts, we'll probably go back to being a bit
more normal.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Will Hardcastle from UBS. Please go

Q - Will Hardcastle

{BIO 16346311 <GO>}

Good afternoon, everyone. High level given so many granular questions that presumably,
we're looking at higher return on capital year-on-year. How should I think about the
volatility shift year-on-year because we retaining more business, small cap perhaps as
volatility then there is a mix shift within the portfolio. I guess we've got high returns -expected returns. Sorry, but is volatility higher, similar or lower year-on-year?

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

So obviously, everything that we're doing are always subject to large losses. Everything
we're doing improves our expected returns. A lot of the conversation we had about
ratios, if you look at our ratios, they're improving, our expected combined ratio is
improving. I think on the volatility front as well, the benefit of the non -- the less volatile
business we're writing will -- should bring volatility down over time and, therefore,
improve results. Obviously, as you've seen in Q1, we are still subject to large weather
events like everyone else. But over time, that should improve our returns in (inaudible).

Q - Will Hardcastle

{BIO 16346311 <GO>}

FINAL

Is that -- sorry, just follow-up, I guess if a lot of the other lines of business are growing
through Q2, Q4, is there perhaps a view that volatility, when we come to look at it across
the whole year, may be lower, but because a lot of the growth in Q1 has come in some of
the more cat lines, it might short-term increase volatility? But net-net, we're looking at
higher returns, lower volatility. Is that how we should look at this?

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

I think that obviously depends on Q2. Obviously, we tend to do some of the -- sort of
higher capital products in Q1, but obviously, things like Florida depends what the
opportunity is. And as we always say, we'll underwrite the market in front of us. And none
of us should be afraid of volatility, you just got to be getting paid to take the volatility and I
think that's the key point.

Q - Iain Pearce

{BIO 19522835 <GO>}

Hi, thanks for allowing me a follow-up. More of a sort of philosophical, high level question.
You've always sort of prided yourself on the underwriting core management being able to
have a very good view of what's going on and sort of seeing the businesses coming into
the Company. I'm just wondering if the expansion that you've had and the new lines of
business that you've been entering, is that becoming a challenge now? Is sort of your
capacity to look at all the business coming through the door, getting quite challenged? Or
is that something where you still see you've got headroom to manage that?

A - Paul Gregory

{BIO 16314515 <GO>}

Hi Iain yeah, I think that's a very good question. I think one point to note is the conference
call that we -- the daily conference call we have is still there, but that has only ever been
to the Company platform, Lancashire UK, and Lancashire Bermuda. And within the Lloyd's
platforms, where we write kind of the smaller tickets, if you like, there is -- and that kind of
oversight, but on a more traditional peer review basis a lot of the new lines we've gone
into fit within that Lloyd's structure.
We have actually evolved the conference call over time, and we'll continue to do that. The
kind of -- what we will always remain is that daily call to look at the big-ticket items that
can, say, even move our capital, where we run bigger retention, more difficult renewals
but as we have grown, that is something we've evolved, but with the DNA of looking at
the big deals that move the dial being on that call every day, and that will remain as we go

Page 17 of 18



Company N ame: L ancashire H oldings L td
Company Ticker: L RE L N Equity
Date: 2021-04-29

into more lines of business, then it will be more of the focus on the big-ticket items. But
that -- it will definitely remain part of our DNA. It will definitely remain part of our process.

FINAL

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

I think as well, remember that we -- we've added a lot of really good people, we
promoted some really good people, and the business has moved on. So, we've got lots
of eyes looking at the appropriate risks and, as Paul said, where we're writing the larger
line sizes or the things that move the dial, there's much risk management on those
products as there's always been and as should be for a business such as ours.

Q - Iain Pearce
