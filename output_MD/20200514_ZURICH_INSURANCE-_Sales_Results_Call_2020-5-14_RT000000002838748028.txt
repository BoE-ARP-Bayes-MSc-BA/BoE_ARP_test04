Mario Greco

{BIO 1754408 <GO>}

Thank you, Richard and good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We're
living through an unprecedented health crisis. Over recent weeks, our priority has been to
support our customers and local communities, while ensuring the safety and the wellbeing of our colleagues. We moved early to remote working and our business has been
fully operational through -- with our investment in the digitalization of our business over
the recent years paying oﬀ.
Our business model and decisions taken over years are designed to ensure that the
group remains resilient. Our group is highly diversiﬁed both in terms of geography and
business line with no dependency on any single market or business. Our focus on
achieving returns through underwriting rather than investment has ensured that we have
maintained a conservative structure investment portfolio, with relatively lower exposure to
some of the more stressed industries in asset classes. In life, we moved away from stress
based savings already over a decade ago, thereby, making our life business more resilient
to ongoing low investments in, while also reducing our overall direct exposure to
investment markets. Our unique farmers business provides us with a high level of stable
fee-based earnings and non-regulated cash remittances back to the group. Further, the
balance sheet is strong and capitalized even under our own highly conservative Z-ECM
ratio, which is calibrated to be consistent with a AA rating.
On a regulatory basis, the Swiss Solvency Test the ratio of 186% is also well above any
requirement. This capital strength is complemented by moderate leverage and signiﬁcant
to insurance protection. The ﬁrst quarter so the business continued to deliver a solid topline performance, with the crisis having only limited impact mainly in life sales in the
quarter. Most importantly, we continue to see improved rates across the business most
notably in North America and we expect this to continue.
As an insurer, we're used to handling crisis in complex events like those that we are
experiencing. We've seen it before with the events like a Hurricane Katrina and the attacks
on the World Trade Center. We have provided you with a number today for the potential
claims related to the COVID-19 outbreak and see this well within our tolerance is similar to
the claims from the three hurricane of 2017.
As we showed then, we're more than capable of managing such events. We expected the
crisis to strengthen demand for digital interaction and more tailored services, and we are
already looking beyond the current crisis to make the changes necessary to the business
to adapt to what will be a changed world. The combination of our ﬂexible and resilient
business model, our committed employees and the strength of our balance sheet gives

position to take advantage of new opportunities as they present themselves.
George and I will now be happy to take your questions.

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you very much and good morning to all, good afternoon all. All. Appreciate the
extra disclosure and, obviously, the eﬀorts at quantifying the losses, which I appreciate is a
very diﬃcult exercise. Just going to use my two questions, if I may to just try and
understand a little bit more about the assumptions that you've used behind that.
So ﬁrst of all, on business interruption, you -- on the point that more than 99% of your
property policies do not COVID-19. I guess, my reading of that is that you're relying to an
extent on the physical damage clause maybe for some of those policies. I was just
wondering if you could specify which -- what proportion of the policy speciﬁcally exclude
disease risk?
And then, my second question was on workers' compensation. And I guess, if you look at
the WCIRB midpoint estimate, which they got to USD11.2 billion. If you -- your market
share equates to a bit over USD500 million. Obviously, you've quoted a much lower
number in terms of your exposure, and I appreciate there's lots of moving parts there. But
I was just wondering if you could give us a sort of a rough walk from their number to your
number, which looks in terms of your exposure, which looks like being about USD30
million? Thank you very much.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Peter, it's George. So, thank you. So let me start with the policy was in copay, so you see
the comment in the presentation today we mentioned it, so 99% of the policies don't
provide a cover, the vast majority having viruses of some exclusions. That means we're not
relying on the property damage -- so even if we believe that the property damage wasn't
exclusive, if you look at our standards, contract language, we have -- for example in the
U.S., the ISO standard form has the virus exclusion, and both of our two typical standard
wordings have the virus exclusion. So, we're not relying solely on property damage to
give us comfort that we're going to avoid a challenge to coverage on the basis there's no
property damage.

FINAL

On the workers comp side -- so on the workers' comp topic. I think the big diﬀerence
between what you see in the -- either the WCIRB scenario or the NCCI paper that was out,
I think last week or maybe even this week. It's a type of product that we are oﬀering. So, I
think it's not an issue if you walk through the assumptions, you get a diﬀerent answer. A
large part of our book is high deductible. I think as we've talked about before, and that
high deductible book means that we don't cover the ground up cost.
So then any reasonable scenario, most of the cost of that actually falls back on the client
that we are providing the high excess coverage to. And I think that's why you see a
diﬀerence to what do you expect from a market share perspective for us and what you
actually see in the calculating number that we have today. So, on the debt that we've
given the range that we give in the USD30 million to USD150 million is based on the
bottom end to the midpoint of WCIRB, using exactly the same assumptions as they've
used only it's modeled on the entire U.S. book. The big diﬀerence is that high deductible
feature.

Next question comes from the line of Vinit Malhotra from Mediobanca. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Hey, good afternoon. Hope you guys are doing well. Thank you very much. So, I had one
workers' comp which has been addressed, so thank you for that. Next one is only the
commentary about the economic impact -- scenario, little bit diﬀerently. If GDP globally or
your market better say 4%, 5% this year, would there be a material risk to the USD750
million number? Thank you very much.

A - Mario Greco

{BIO 1754408 <GO>}

So, it's a slightly tricky question to answer, isn't it? So what we've done today is to focus on
the direct P&C claim impact. I mean, there may be second order eﬀects that we could see
later this year or next year. I mean, there are obviously things like D&O or credit. I mean,
we don't believe we have a signiﬁcant exposure to this either because of the size of the
premium volumes and the overall portfolio or because of insurance protection. But if we
see a very signiﬁcant form in GDP, you would expect to see a bit more distress in the real
economy that maybe we see already, and that can have some impact.
But again, from a direct claim eﬀect, we haven't modeled that into it, but we tried to
consider the impact of that in the scenario that we've given this morning. So for now,
we're focused on the right claim. If we do see GDP continue to weaken as a result of
what's going on, I think the most likely thing you're going to see on is it's probably less a
bigger impact on the claim and more likely an impact on volumes because, of course,
some of the premium ﬂows are activity dependent. So, we workers' comp as we discussed

earlier has a payroll components and to the extent payrolls for, we've all -- premiums. The
model is the direct claim impact that we expect to see.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Thank you. And if I can use my second option, please. The property premiums disclosure
on the BI slide adding up to 8.7 or so, billion. Would we know what is the NEP, because
the reason is that I understand from speaking to IR team that there's a lot of -- captive
business there, and also that when I go back to Jim Shea's slide of Investor Day, the
property exposure of, say, the commercial unit was only 26%. But these numbers stood on
this slide are much higher, is it possible to have a sense of the NEP or this is not a very --

A - George Quinn

Property in general, please.

Your next question comes from the line of Nick Holmes from Societe Generale. Please go
ahead.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

Hi, there. Thank you very much. Two questions. First is coming back on BI. I wonder are
you worried by legal risk, I mean if the Maverick court rules that insurers should pay out,
how big a worry is that for you? And then, second with the Z-ECM, just coming back to the
calibration, I mean why set it as 100%? Why not further 200% like SST or Solvency II
because that would sort of look better. Just wondered what you're thinking is, I mean,
because when it falls below 100%, what sort of message is that meant to send to the
market?

A - Mario Greco

{BIO 1754408 <GO>}

George, can I take the ﬁrst one?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Of course, yeah.

FINAL

A - Mario Greco

{BIO 1754408 <GO>}

Thank you. Look Nick, I mean, we worry about everything because we're insurers and
we're used to deal with any kind of risks. So by deﬁnition, the answer to your question is
yes. However, if the worry is that somebody will ask us to pay for things that we have
never insured, that frankly is worry that doesn't take long to be forgotten because then it
can be valid for everything. And we're living in a world where nothing is any more sense
for certainty. Here we're not talking about the interpretation. We're talking of things that
don't exist. And so, as such, then anything can be attributed to us any kind of cost or need
you have, you can raise it against insurance. And so, you don't really worry for that
because it's a kind of world that we are -- it's pointless to worry about.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So, on the capital topic, so I mean it's a topic we've discussed several times in the past, I
think the -- and in fact, we talked last year about the fact that after we saw the moves on
interest rates in Q3, that we might look at making some changes. I mean, you can see
that, I mean, with FINMA's support -- we've moved to the FINMA which, of course, is very
standard approach in Switzerland. That, from an SST perspective, again, gives us
something that is, I guess, closer to the optical numbers that you see from the peer group.
But again, recognizing that, that number is still very conservative compared to the
Solvency II basis.
So why keep the Z-ECM? I mean, really two reasons. So one is that, I think we all know that
capital use and I guess it's become more apparent, there's a number of capital regimes in
there -- over there that have signiﬁcant -- bill onto them. And you've seen the in terms of
stress, it's become more hard to rely on -- as the basis for our capital management policy
because clearly fear is that might go beyond the number or what the number which
represent. So for us, even though, I mean, Z-ECM obviously represents a particularly
tough test. It's obviously calibrated at 100 to AA, but the way we parameterize it is
unchanged. We have swap rates. We don't have ultimate forward rate. I mean that for us, I
think, is consistent with how we think about the risks that we run.
And I think if we were to get rid of Z-ECM and try to live in a world where everything was
smooth, and nothing was market neutral, I'm not quite sure where we would end up. And
I think the -- I mean you saw it positively this year from us. So obviously, we paid the
dividend back in April. We did, as requested, review on the scenarios and the stress is
that the company could be subject to and even after that review at the end of March, we
went ahead and paid because those -- scenarios been, in our opinion, lead to a
conclusion other than the one we previously reached.
So, I think actually having something that is a tough test, but maybe more reﬂects the
reality and the kind of environment we're in today is a good tool to have in the toolkit. But
when you're thinking about comparison to the others, then we're beginning to use the
SST number plus -- to really get a valid comparison. I think we're going to keep this
combination, because both of them play an important role.

Great. Can I just have a very, very quick follow-up which is with legal risk, are there any
jurisdictions, for example, with U.S. versus UK, that you would be more worried about that
there could be some Maverick decision?

FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Not really. I mean, in those countries and, in fact, just about every country where we
operate, there's an established legal process. I mean, we all know the quirks and some of
the unusual features that some of these systems have, it's not as if this is a new topic. We
know how to navigate it. And as I said, in response to Peter's call, the topic of the
discussion, I mean, we've got good contract wording. We have good defense to the
challenge and I'm sure there may be others who are quite easier targets who are stopping
-- I mean if someone decides that something want to go after we believe we've got a
good foundation that -- sounds.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 3387435 <GO>}

That sounds very reassuring. Thank you very much.

Next question comes from the line of Edward Morris from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Edward Morris

{BIO 16274236 <GO>}

Hi, everybody. Thank you for taking my questions. I hope everyone's well. First question is
on topic of reinsurance. I wonder if you can just talk through whether the USD750 million
assumed any beneﬁt from any of the excess of loss reinsurance that you have or is that
only from -- share? And is there any particular attachment points or things that you would
point us towards that give you conﬁdence in that ﬁgure or should some of the
assumptions change, et cetera? So just some comments on reinsurance would be good.
And the second question really relates to underlying performance in some business lines,
which I guess actually see improving claims trends because of COVID, principally I'm
thinking quota here, I noticed USD70 million you talk about as providing support for
customers. I wonder if that USD70 million has any signiﬁcance? I'm just sort of thinking
about how you're likely to think of individual versus business lines versus the group? Are
you likely to return premium in books of business that are proving to be more proﬁtable
than expected or would you view it as a group and manage on that basis? Thanks.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So, thanks, Ed. On the reinsurance fee, the modeling assumes that only the quarter shares
are irrelevant for now, and that's just a simpliﬁcation that was applied to make the whole
process more straightforward. I mean if I look at the various contracts we have in place
from the insurance perspective, I think I mean most of them don't have pandemic
exclusions. But again, for the time being, the only assumption we've made is that the
quota share on the property business in the U.S. attaches.

Page 7 of 20

On this underlying performance or -- I mean I guess we think about internally is impacted
frequency. So obviously, lower activity has an impact across the group. You're absolutely
right. We've highlighted today what some of our businesses have committed to return
some of that beneﬁt we've seen so far to the early part of the long term. I mean the
message we've given people is that this is really a -- it might be a market-by-market OpEx
that can be a big tap from the group that says we wanted to do this because every market
is a bit unique in some way. Of course, in some markets, premiums may adjust naturally
because of the nature of the way the premium is calculated, individuals or companies may
have other right to suspend cover, if you choose to.
So again, we've encouraged the businesses to look at this, but we haven't set an
expectation for what should be done. On the -- I mean, who is the main target of this
topic. Again, I mean, it's clearly more of a retail and probably SME issue than it is an issue
of the bigger end of commercial I mean to the extent that risks are adjusted on some way
typical commercial contracts in the upper end, we'll include some element of that. So, I
think our view would be that, by and large, that feature to some degree, will exist already
as on the retail side of things, that's less common. And again, it's more important to think
about it in that context. So that's why you've seen us do what we've done so far.

Q - Edward Morris

Next question comes from the line of Farooq Hanif from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi, everybody. Two questions. First one on pricing, to what extent was this going to
happen anyway? And to what extent, thus far, are we seeing some sort of COVID-related
support? And do you think, given the experience in 2Q, that we might see some further
acceleration in pricing?
And secondly, on your sensitivities, I noticed Z-ECM that your credit spread seems to have
gone up, but interest rates gone down. Just wondering if there's anything special about
convexity relating to credit spread sensitivity that we should take into account? Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thanks, Farooq. So on the pricing topic, that's a -- it's a really hard question to answer. I
think the only way I can really try and give you a sense of how we see it is that, we
obviously we had plans for something this year. And what we're seeing is signiﬁcantly
exceeding, I mean, what we've anticipated from a planning perspective. So, I think our
view would be that there's this additional factor, which of course, is squeezing capital and
surplus across the industry is pushing pricing. And we see it not only in the U.S. in the
beginning of Q2, you also see it in Europe as well. In fact, the move in Europe, even
though it hasn't reached the levels of the U.S., the move in Europe is more dramatic from
where it started. So again, probably further acceleration -- for how long it's going to

FINAL

continue? I wouldn't like to predict, but certainly, we've seen a very strong pricing
environment entering Q2.
On sensitivities, I think the main driver of that is going to be a combination of -- I mean
just as -- as the numbers drop, the discounting impacts become much smaller. So the
optical sensitivity just naturally rise. And if you look at what we've done from a -- I mean
we haven't done a ton of hedging, but we've done some things to take some of the -some marginal risk oﬀ the table. We put in a bit more on the interest rate side than we
have on trading. But the credit sensitivity is almost certainly due to the fact that just that
it's lower interest rate levels, the impact is -- appears to be larger.

Q - Farooq Hanif

Next question comes from the line of Johnny Vo from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Johnny Vo

{BIO 5509843 <GO>}

Good afternoon, guys. Thanks very much. Just a couple of questions around the
sensitivity again of that USD750 million. I wonder if you can share with us, I understand
that you don't have consistency across the group given that your allowed to just look at
what -- if you can give us just a feel for sensitivity to that USD750 million with regards to BI
sublimits before reinsurance or average lockdown timeframes that you've assumed for
that USD750 million. So, we get a sense of where that number could move to
approximately?
And the second question just relates to -- you've made a statement with regards to
expenses. Are you providing sort of new guidance on expenses or are you saying you
have ﬂexibility on expenses? Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thank you. And so the ﬁrst one, I mean the temptation to want to give you all the diﬀerent
components of the model for me is quite high, but I'm not going to do it. And the main
reason for that is if I look at the -- one of the key sources of BI that we have in the portfolio
currently, that actually has a time limit in it today. And so the scenario that we've chosen
extends beyond that, but one of the key drivers doesn't require that assumption to arrive
at the number that we've achieved. So actually giving you a lockdown timeframe doesn't - wouldn't substantially help you understand the sensitivities that we would have to the
timing topic. More relevant on travel, and so -- again, we've assumed a timeframe, that
certainly extends well beyond from where we are today and travel because of the summer
timeframe can have a bigger impact. Because that is reﬂected in the ﬁgures you've seen
today for us.
On expenses, I think we're not signaling that I guess we're both -- and other that large
expense reduction plan. I think that what we are trying to signal is that we're trying to be
Page 9 of 20



FINAL

Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG
Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2020-05-14

as proactive as we can. And the reality is that in our business, we have some things. I
mean, the obvious example is travel. And so, travel is likely to be structurally aﬀected by
this for some time to come. And I think if we sat and we waited and we do nothing, I don't
think there's any hope in the short-term but the picture improves. So I mean, we made the
decision that we need to take action on that topic straight away. On the rest of it on the
expense topic more broadly, I mean, consistent with the investor presentation that we set
out back in November last year, we had a number of areas where we were investing for
growth. And I think if you look at from where we stand today, some of that is still valid.
Some of that is invalid.
And again, we're trying to react quickly to avoid, that we've built up on expense basis,
that becomes a structural problem. And prevents us from having the ability to respond to
an environment that in the aftermarket, this may reveal some diﬀerent demands on -- and
our customer base. But I mean you've seen from us over the course of the last three years,
we've managed the expense base tightly. That has not changed. That will continue
through the course of this year, but that comment, that's really a signal to us reacting to
what we see and also trying to anticipate some of the change that is undoubtedly coming
in the market and the way that we operate, both with distribution and with customers
directly.

Hey, all. Thank you very much. And then, just like Andrew said I actually one that -- good
as well and two quick questions. One is a bit longer than -- but ﬁrst one is on the bond
portfolio. If you can give a little bit more color. It's fantastic to have this. It's not a criticism,
but some of your peers have provided a bit more and it's easier to compare. One is on
the BBB minus exposure and the second is on the rating downgrade risk. And the third
one is on aviation, your ﬁgure for transportation by that. I'm sure that aviation was much
smaller than this.
And then on the USD750 million, it's fantastic that you provide -- update and I suppose
another way of asking the question my peers have asked is, how much of the does that
certainty which you provide comes up from the fact that you do have a little bit of
potential buﬀer on quota? Thank you. And if I may, how big is that quota share? Thank
you.

stage. So, if we were republishing the tables today, they would look a lot like the ones that
you saw then. So, apologies, I don't have at my ﬁngertips. But, what we gave for the yearend would be a good indicator of the exposure at the end of the quarter. So, on the
ledger and airline side of things, within the portfolio again, it's a really small -- we will see So, 0.1% of the group's investment. So if you look at the diﬀerent components, we've got
about that more than 40 in equity and the remainder is ﬁxed income. So much less than
1/10 of 1%. What was the third questions like that.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 21454754 <GO>}

The third question is probably the same USD750 million, so it's -- to have certainty and I
admire it but how much in when you frame that did you think that if things move a little bit
that you can use a bit more buﬀer for motor I just wanted to ask if that's right and maybe -

A - Mario Greco

So, the only thing I've got -- I know that you read this and I'm going to remind you that we
carefully avoided the use of the word certainty in the press release, for the obvious
reason, there was quite a lot of uncertainty currently. On the absence of an assumption of
the frequency beneﬁt and I think for the time being just recognizing there are lots of
moving parts. I mentioned already that I mean there are some things that are not
modeled and for the reasons I gave earlier. And I think it's helpful to have frequency to set
against that too for the time being. Obviously, as we go on through the year, the level of
clarity will improve, things will become clearer and we'll update at that stage. But for the
time being we thought about frequency is addressing some of the both known, unknowns
and the unknowns at this time.

The next question comes from the line of Michael Haid from Commerzbank. Please, go
ahead.

Q - Michael Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Only one question on life insurance, apparently,
you have seen the ﬁrst impact of the current COVID-19 prices on your new business
generation. I would like to get a better feeling on how sensitive the new business
generation is the lockdown measures that have been taken. Given that the lockdowns
were basically put in place only mid-March in the ﬁrst quarter, I ﬁnd the decline of the new
business in life quite signiﬁcant.

Bloomberg Transcript

So is the extent of the decline a result of the last two weeks in the ﬁrst quarter or more was
the decline more evenly spread over the ﬁrst quarter? Also, given that the second quarter
is almost -- it is now halfway through. Can you give us an indication of new business
generation how it was aﬀected in the second quarter so far?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yeah, thanks, Michael. So the -- so maybe a couple of things about the comparison yearover-year. So, and the answer is right, the lockdown component comes quite late in the
quarter. I mean, it varies market to market. So obviously, the Asian markets have been
impacted for longer. But then you already saw it, for example, the Latin American
business, the stuﬀ that we do directly plus the business that we get through the joint
venture. That continued into the early part of the quarter. We have seen some
improvement in the trend in new business it's not back to where it was before. I think
we've certainly seen it improve and production has come up again.
But there's still a gap that needs to be closed to bring us back to that you would have
ordinarily seen. I think the other thing to keep in mind is the comparison to the last year's
number. Last year's number includes a pretty exceptional quarter for the Swiss business.
So, you might remember that there was some duplication in the Swiss life market late -middle late, 2018, but our team did a great job here in taking advantage of that. So part of
the challenge that we got this quarter is that comparison to the decline. The lockdown
component is at the end of the quarter, it has continued, but we have certainly an
improvement in some markets, albeit we still have room to improve further to get back to
what we've seen before.

Next question comes from a line of James Shuck from Citi. Please go ahead.

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Thanks, good morning. Just one question from me, please just on the dividend. My
understanding, I think the dividend policy is to grow with underlying earnings, and you
have a small level of CHF17 a share. I just came to know whether there's some kind of soft
bracket on that number. So when it comes to making the full year decision you look at the
prior year and think, well, it's going to be something very abnormal in order to make an
absolute reduction year-on-year? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thanks, James. So I mean, it's a topic that -- actually, we've discussed several times over
the course of the last three or four years. If you think back to 2017, it was already a topic
then. And, of course, we had the impact of the 3 hurricanes in the U.S., which were a
signiﬁcant impact on the earnings for that year, a number that's not too far away from the
ﬁgure we've given today. And if you remember what we did then and what we said to the
market at that point was that we were trying to look through the temporary eﬀects. So the
current year if you look at the base and also spending as much time looking at the coming
year, and what that would bring us in terms of capacity to make sure that the position that
we adopted would be sustainable. No change to that process. I don't expect we get to
the end of the year in the new one. But of course, at this point in the year, it's just too early
to start to get you the detail of that. But I mean you've seen what we've done in the past.
In terms of process, I expect you would give the same thing again.

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. I actually do have a second question, if I may. But I think
you just mentioned in your early commentary, around the reinsurance coverage in
protection. You said that most of your reinsurance covers doesn't have pandemic
exclusions. That's somewhat the odds from what we hear from many of the reinsurance
companies that actually report that they do you actually explicitly say that they do have
pandemic inclusions. Can you just shed a little bit of light on your commentary versus my
understanding?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

It's a bit hard for me to do that because I can't really talk from their point of view. So, I
mean some of the contracts that we have are very clear pandemic exclusions than some -Why there would be a diﬀerent picture presented to the market at large is not a question
I'm capable of answering for you.

Your coverage comes from a wide range of reinsurance providers. And it is most of those
policies that don't have pandemic exclusions. Is that fair?

FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So again, I mean our reinsurance coverage comes from names that you would be very
familiar with. I mean, obviously, it would depend on which particular risks, a particular
reinsurer's on it would deﬁne whether they would have more or less with us. But certainly
the key contracts that we have, more key contracts with -- I mean we have a large number
of contracts that do not have pandemic exclusions.

Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous. Please go
ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Hi, there. I wonder, if you could just concentrate on the asset side for a minute and -- I
mean Zurich's been quite tactical in the past and tell us if there are any major shifts or
even any subtle shifts in asset allocation over the ﬁrst quarter in response to market
movements? I'm thinking particularly in terms of low-grade credit, any additional
hedging, either on credit or equities. So just what was the response on the asset side to
the market moves?
And second question, just in you proved sort of ﬁrst stab and claims number, I think,
excludes third-party losses. I think it's only ﬁrst-party exposures. Just as a broad outline,
just give us a sense of where the third-party liability exposure would arise. Obviously,
things like D&O but is there any other exposure to things like healthcare liability sectors,
that kind of stuﬀ. Just some broad outline as for the third-party liability trends and your
sort of expectations there would be useful. Thanks.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yeah. Okay. All right. So on the ﬁrst one, we made relatively small changes over the
course of Q1. So it's a group of us we meet every week. We review where we are open on
the Urban, Chief Investment Oﬃcer and on the asset side. I think the team have done an
excellent job, and the way we structured the portfolio before those things started. So, I
mean, as you've heard already on the airline side, we don't have a giant exposure. When
we had the oil and gas topic, a few weeks ago, we had already that we don't have a major
exposure there lie the portfolio is pretty granular. So I look like we're overweight in a
particular name or geography. So, what we done?
So we did put some hedging on equities, which would have been -- exactly for some time
in middle of Q1. So that will have reduced the exposure that you saw reported at the end

of the year. The team had planned some tactical changes around credit and the only
request we made to retain those as well, let's do it a little bit quicker than we had
intended. That's not that signiﬁcant in the size of book that we've got, but it just takes a
better the credit exposure down. And then the other one is interest rates.
So, I mean just given the model that we have from a capital modeling perspective and go
back to the compensation, that I think ideally net on Z-ECM model, there's no UFR in
there. So there's an interest rate sensitivity that you guys have seen in the disclosed
numbers. So, I mean we did -- we have taken some additional steps to again, reduce the
exposure that we have there. I mean just given that obviously, the markets are a bit
volatile is hard to do that in scale or size. So, I mean what we've really done is more at the
margins and something that we present dramatically diﬀerent picture, but those have
been the key areas of focus.

Bloomberg Transcript

So on the third-party side, I mean, D&O is the obvious one. The -- I mean, as you'd expect
by now, of course, we have notiﬁcations, not many, but we have a few, I mean the
challenge on D&O, I think is until the dust settles and it becomes however free for all
because of the market move and the issues start to focus on maybe companies have got
more particular issues and maybe more exposed. It's very hard to make any assessment of
what happens on D&O, other than we've got a big market move on prior history has
taught us that it's normally accompanied by an increase in activity around D&O.
On the other third-party topics, I think the one of things we've been looking at carefully
with the -- life or the employment liability side of things, there's obviously a speciﬁc
liability on particular sectors you mentioned, healthcare. And I guess there, the -- I mean,
again, the preoccupation is to try and look for areas where we believe there's a risk where
we're overexposed or we have a particularly large disproportionate share of a particular
sector. And we don't see that at this stage. So when it comes back to the scenario
modeling, none of these things pop up and they kind of -- they kind of size that would
cause a signiﬁcant concern at this stage. But again, in the third-party topic will play out
probably one after this thing has reached some kind of equilibrium. So I mean, the true
impact of that will all become clear with the passage of quite a bit of time. But for us,
given what we've done in frequency, getting the scale that we have in our book, and we
think that's reﬂected in the scenarios we've given today.

at the Investor Day, you talked about sort of credit and surety is a line where you are sort
of pushing back against some of the sort of bottom-up planning submissions for some of

the BUs. Can you just talk a little bit about the credit -- exposure in the book and how you
see that developing?
And then secondly, just to loop back on the question that Farooq asked you, possible
question about sort of rates, et cetera. I just wondered what your view was in terms of the
weakness of the corporate sector and the ability to push through rate increases, given the
level of the solvencies and see the precarious trading position of the companies? Thank
you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So, on these two topics. So, ﬁrst of all, on credit surety. I think we talked already last year
about the fact that from a strategic perspective, the group had decided that we weren't
comfortable with a further expansion and capacity through credit insure is because of
what we saw in terms of the developing environment, and also what we've seen through a
number of idiosyncratic events that we didn't in themselves seem to portray any
systematic challenge, but you've seen a few more. And of course, you saw Thomas Cook
last year. And Thomas Cook is not the only one.

Bloomberg Transcript

So we've got cap on things that squeezed the book quite a bit last year. I mean beyond
that, I mean we haven't yet, as you can imagine, being able to implement a shrinkage in
the book, just given timing. Having said that, I mean, today, we did disclose the -- but
global Surety Reinsurance program. And I guess, if you've had a chance to look at that,
you'll get a sense of, I mean, why we've had such signiﬁcant events that we haven't
caused signiﬁcant impacts in the P&L.
We renewed that contract early in the year. As you can imagine, we paid more for it than
we have in the past. It's obviously focused on surety, which is the bulk of our credit and
surety book. So I'd say that. I mean, overall, for a combination of what we've done in
tapping capacity, what we've done on the reinsurance side, I think we feel comfortable
that we're well protected. I mean we can't have things go wrong there, but the risk that
something accumulates over a large number of names is obviously protected by the
structure we've got in place. On the rate --

A - Mario Greco

{BIO 1754408 <GO>}

Yes. Sure. Can I give you a little bit of rest? So on the market situation, guys, it's important
to understand that the big portion of our commercial books are with midsized or global
corporate accounts. And they are not immune, just to cause large from a while ago. But
they're rather sensitive to what's happening, meaning that the business continues that the
revenues continue. And so they have no issues about following the market rates or about
into premiums. The thing that we are very pleased to see is that the quality also of our
contract keeps improving. We signaled this already. I think Jim talk about this in the
November Investors Day, and this is continuing. So we are building a much better book
on commercial, not just by the strength of the rate increase, but also by the conditions
that we have in this book, and this is fairly independent from COVID. COVID is more an
issue for individuals and SMEs. But has less of an impact on the big accounts.

The next question is a follow-up question from Peter Eliot. Please go ahead.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you very much for the opportunity to come back. If I could mention 2 more. I mean,
ﬁrst of all, on capital fungibility, I mean you mentioned the strong and unregulated nature
of farmers in the start. I'm just wondering if you can sort of talk more generally about sort
of any impacts on your ability to upstream cash, especially in sort of regulatory
impediments that was the ﬁrst question. And then the second one, on the SST versus
Solvency II. You mentioned the 90 percentage points of the respective entities. I was just
wondering if you could sort of translate that into a group level delta. Thank you very
much.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

On the capital fungibility topic, obviously, the ﬁrst point is the most important one to
farmers obviously concentrates a large part of the cash ﬂow and it's not subject to
permanent. So within a relatively fortunate position compared to the industry in general,
that I mean, every year that starts, there's a very large part of the cash ﬂow that's I mean
pretty much guaranteed. I mean more broadly on the regulatory side, as you can imagine,
we're in regular contact with all of the key Tier 1 entities and monitoring their solvency.
We're talking to them about what plans for dividend ﬂows.
I mean it's just against way too early in the year to reach any conclusions interm if we
would project out today, I certainly wouldn't plan for the same level of cash ﬂow that we
had anticipated say when we've completed the planning at the end of last year. But that
said, the cash ﬂow that we would anticipate today, and that's still a pretty healthy ﬂow
through the entire growth. So at this stage, I don't anticipate any issues. I do expect to be
somewhat impacted by the general environment. But obviously, the foundation that
farmers gives us is a great starting point for the year.
On the -- can I translate the -- into a group impact and the answer is no. I'm just unit that
smart. And I think the way you need to think about this is there's tons of complexity
because I mean, obviously, you guys understand that, in general, we're comparing
standards model outcomes, and how that would translate into individual model outcomes
with some of the larger peers that we have in Europe is not really that clear to me. And

also, it's important to remember that when we were here in Europe, in U.S. gets a
completely diﬀerent treatment under Solvency II versus SST because, of course, an SST,
we model it according to ﬁnds requirements, and we don't this equivalence assumption,
which, of course, can create beneﬁts in things like corporate bond spreads. So I think all I
can tell you is that it's not 90, but the number is not immaterial that it would be substantial
uplift to the [ 186 ] that we've published today.

The next question comes from Thomas Fossard from HSBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi, Two last questions for me. The ﬁrst 1 would be on the business trends. George, if you
could share any revenue trends in April or May? Just to have a feel of if you're already
noticing some reduction in the business ﬂow, not sure it is making sense with what you
just mentioned, but just to get a feel of how business is slowing down at present time?
Second question would be on the measures you've taken in light of the COVID crisis. I
mean, in terms of taking decision to shift the book towards all diﬀerent business lines,
additional protections on the asset side, I think that you say that nothing have really
changed in Q1. But overall, I mean, any decisions you've taken for the remainder of the
year in light of the crisis and in light of current development?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yes. Thanks, Tom. So on the ﬁrst one, the -- I think the short-term would be that from a rate
perspective, the early Q2 indications are -- they're really good. It's very strong across the 2
key markets. North America and Europe. And I think I mentioned earlier that if you look at
Europe, it's not at the level of the U.S., but they had a much larger leap in April.
Compared to what we've seen previously. So rate is good. I think the challenge is going
to be growth. So I think we did a really good start to the year. The teams both in Europe
and in the U.S.
We've done a great job but I think if we just look at current trends, so I think as you hear
from the entire market. And as you look at -- I mean, some of the broader industry
analysis, you can see that new business as has fallen signiﬁcantly from what we've seen in
prior periods. That's partially oﬀset by the fact that retention is up signiﬁcantly. So it's not
a net fall, but it's that combination. Is what's in nice to tell people that. And for the year in
total, you probably to expect a premium picture that's ﬂat to maybe even slightly down for
the full year.
Business shifts. I mean, other of the things I've mentioned here on the call already around
travel, I mean largely, no, I think the -- Mario has already mentioned the fact that the
things we've done around the portfolio, the quality of the portfolio, the approach to
underwriting, I mean, all of those things that we've already done, I think put us in -- for the
Page 18 of 20

environment we're now in and at this point, at least, we don't see that we need to make
further signiﬁcant shifts. In fact, I mean -- a bit consistent as we go through this is actually
more important.

ahead.

Q - Michael Huttner

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 21454754 <GO>}

Yes. Quick question one is, what is the current prices? How is that aﬀecting the ANZ life
integration in the -- of cash there? And the second is you mentioned in your slides the
potential gross capital allocation we extract capital from non-core businesses and I
thought this is nice and just wondered what that might be? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yes. Thanks, Michael. So I think it would be fair to say that if you look across the entire
group, the team that has the most strength currently would be our Australian life team
because they have the integration to manage. They've got the charge of the current
events and to manage and you've got the aftermath of the Royal Commission that took
place down in Australia. I think they're doing a great job.
This will be a bit of a diﬃcult year given that combination. I'm not going to give
predictions for where the year will end. Today, there's a number of things that -- I think I
talked about last year, for example, on the -- some of the steps we will make to adjust the
portfolio to make it more proﬁtable. The team has that in -- and I mean the key reasons
and the key drivers behind the acquisition of ANZ and life to remain true today. So -that's a brand that we use is a great addition to the portfolio. So that will be a slightly
diﬃcult year for that life business is already from many of our life companies.
On the noncore businesses, I guess, in common with a number of friendly, competitive -- I
mean, the real is environment that this make you think again about the composition of the
portfolio. And maybe your patience or enthusiasm for some things is a bit diminished. So
I think we're just signaling that the things that we've done already to regularly recycle
capital away from risks that we think are fully rewarded to those that we think have greater
and more positive strategic impact on the company. That process is going to continue,
and the fact, as you can imagine, against this current backdrop, we'll get a bit more
energy.
