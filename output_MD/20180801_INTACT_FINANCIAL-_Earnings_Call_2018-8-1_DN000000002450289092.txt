{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today.
Last night, we announced second quarter net operating income of the CAD1.38 per share
driven by solid underlying results including improved personal auto performance.
OneBeacon also delivered strong results adding approximately CAD0.12 to our net
operating income per share and net investment income grew by 28%.
Early in the quarter, however, many of our customers in Central Canada faced the
consequences of three severe storms. These CATs impacted net operating income per
share by CAD0.75 almost twice the expected level, but as usual our troops across the
country work tirelessly to help get customers back on track.

Bloomberg Transcript

Topline growth as reported was 16% driven primarily by the addition of OneBeacon. And
when I look across our entire North American operation, on an organic basis, the portfolio
grew by about 2%. We're seeing strong growth in proﬁtable segments on the back of
favorable market conditions and in segments where proﬁtability actions are in progress,
we saw topline declines as expected, a clear sign that our people across North America
are executing quite well.
The overall IFC combined ratio was 96.1%. The Canadian performance at 96.6% reﬂects
improvement in personal auto and strong underlying fundamentals and personal
property and commercial business.
Our US operations delivered a solid performance with a combined ratio of 93.8% as we
drive towards a sustainable low 90s level. Book value per share grew 15% over the past
year. Operating ROE was 12% and we ended the quarter with the total capital margin in
excess of CAD1.2 billion.
When we compare ourselves to the industry at the end of the ﬁrst quarter, we
outperformed by 660 basis points on ROE well above our target of 500 basis points. But
to be clear, while we exceeded our ROE outperformance target, I'm not happy with 12%
ROE and we remain focused on actions to return the ROE to the mid-teens.
Let's look in more detail at our results by line of business starting with Canada. So, as we
anticipated, our personal auto portfolio continues to shrink as our rate actions started a
full 18 months ahead of the market. We expect that trajectory to reverse in the coming
year as the market continues to ﬁrm up.

FINAL

In the meantime, we're seeing bottom line beneﬁts. The combined ratio of 95.6%,
improved 2.2 points compared to last year, driven by stronger underlying performance
and lower expenses. This was despite 2.3 points of unfavorable prior year development,
which was largely isolated to pre reform accident beneﬁts in Ontario.
The underlying current accident year loss ratio declined almost 3 points to below 70%.
Excluding pools and the impact from lingering winter weather, we see close to 5 points of
improvement year-over-year. Our action plan in risk selection and in claims are delivering
results in our view and showing signs of taming inﬂation. But we have more to do, our
actions on all fronts will continue and we expect to reach at mid-90s run rate by the end of
the year.
The environment in which we compete continues to tighten with capacity constraints and
rates increasing. Industry growth in the ﬁrst quarter was above 6% and we saw further rate
increases across the country in the second quarter.
We've also seen sustained growth in residual markets conﬁrming our view that the market
is ﬁrming fast. This environment supports our proﬁtability improvement plan and we
expect mid-single-digit growth for the industry in the coming year in that segment.

Bloomberg Transcript

In personal property, premiums grew by 2%, while rates are up, our actions in auto are
putting pressure on growth in that line, given many of our customers have a joint home
and auto policy. The combined ratio in property for the quarter of 102.7% was
disappointing, but includes more than 18 points from CATs.
That said, I'm pleased with the underlying performance where our strategies over time
have been fairly successful and proven to be sustainable. Personal property continues to
be positioned well for the future. The outlook on property is also favorable as changing
weather patterns and elevated catastrophe losses support continued for market
conditions. The industry grew north of 5% in the ﬁrst quarter, and we expect mid-single
digit growth over the next 12 months.
Looking at commercial lines in Canada, top line growth was quite strong at 7%. We saw
accelerating growth in both commercial P&C at 6%, and commercial auto at 8%. The
combined ratio was 92.9% despite close to 7 points from CAT, three times the expected
level.
The underlying fundamentals of this business remain strong, and the outlook is trending
favorably where we expect mid-single digit growth for the industry in the coming year.
Given our loss ratio outperformance in this line is north of 10%. We're uniquely positioned
to take advantage of a ﬁrming environment with a very strong footing of proﬁtability.
Turning now to results for our US commercial segment, premiums of CAD374 million
bolstered IFC's top line growth signiﬁcantly. On an organic basis, growth was 2%,
including low double-digit growth in the segments we're focusing on for expansion.

FINAL

We saw declines in segments undergoing proﬁtability improvement as we expected. The
combined ratio of 93.8% is an improvement of 1.5 points over last quarter and a second
sequential improvement since closing. Strong progress has been made on synergies and
we will provide more details in his remarks.
We continue to monitor this business very closely as we work towards a sustainable low90s combined ratio. We're well on track to deliver mid-single-digit run rate accretion to
net operating income per share by the end of 2019.
Looking at the US specialty industry outlook, market conditions since the transaction
closed and evolved better than anticipated with modest upward pricing trends
continuing. Overall, we expect low-to-mid-single-digit industry growth for US specialty
over the next 12 months.
Turning to strategy, digital engagement with our customers is an important lever in our
customer-driven strategy. In May, we launched the Intact Insurance mobile app across the
country together with that belairdirect's app we now have an place in industry-leading
platform to connect with our customers like never before.

Bloomberg Transcript

Ad features include amongst others electronic proof of insurance, document access,
claims ﬁling, claims tracking and so on. In the coming weeks, the app will also integrate
our latest telematics oﬀer, which is also very popular with our customers. We see mobile
users engage with us more than twice as often as users of other digital platforms, but this
is meaningful progress and highlights the potential to come from our leadership and
digital engagement and customer driven transformation.
So in conclusion, while the weather impacted results, the resilience of our platform was
evident in the quarter. Actions to improve performance are paying oﬀ and market
dynamics continue to evolve in our favor. Commercial lines in Canada are performing well
and we're taking advantage as growth momentum takes hold.
In personal auto, there's more work to be done, but our action plan is gaining traction
and underlying performance is improving. We're on track to bring the auto combined
ratio run rate to the mid-90s by year-end. Proﬁtability in our US franchise is improving
nicely towards our low 90s goal and we're moving fast to capture growth opportunities.
IFCs ﬁnancial position is strong and we're gaining momentum. Our strategies, initiatives
and discipline position us well to deliver on our ﬁnancial objectives to outperform the
industry ROE by at least 500 basis points every year and grow our net operating income
per share by 10% per year over time.
And with that, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Louis Marcotte.

FINAL

For the second quarter, net operating income of CAD201 million improved 4% over last
year despite almost CAD40 million of additional cap losses. The improvement was driven
by personal auto results, investment income, and one beacon which contributed CAD21
million of new underwriting income to our quarterly results.
Our balance sheet is strong with over CAD1.2 billion in total capital margin and debt to
total capital ratio of 22.5%. Book value per share is up 15% year-over-year and 3% since
the end of the ﬁrst quarter.
Let me provide some additional color on our second quarter results starting with Canada.
The combined ratio in personal auto improved 2.2 points over 2017 as we made good
progress this quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

The overall improvement of 5 points to the underlying current year loss ratio that Charles
discussed was driven mainly by a 5% rise in earned rates, combined with the decline in
both frequency and severity. While there is more to do, the results demonstrate the
eﬀectiveness of our action plan. In terms of new premiums, our written rates are up 5% at
the end of Q2.
The personal auto combined ratio run rate is estimated by removing the noise from
unusual weather, normalizing for prior year development and pools and adjusting for
seasonality. On that basis, we estimate the combined ratio run rate to be approximately
around 97% at the end of second quarter, one point better than where we stood at the
end of the ﬁrst quarter on an apples-to-apples basis. We are encouraged by these results
but we will maintain our eﬀorts until we have reached our mid-90s run rate on the
sustainable basis.
Our Canadian expense ratio remains low and stable at 29.4%. We have been able to
diligently manage expenses while reinvesting in brand and technology to support our
customer driven strategies. We expect the expense ratio to remain at current levels for the
remainder of the year.
Our distribution business is strong and added CAD52 million to operating earnings in the
quarter. We still expect to grow this income stream by 10% in 2018 driven by broker
network growth and proﬁtability improvements.
Now turning to US commercial. We reported a solid 93.8% combined ratio driven by a
healthy underlying current year loss ratio of 56.5%, minimal prior year developments and
a respectable 37% expense ratio.
Although there is still more work to be done as we move towards a sustainable low-90s
level, our Proﬁt Improvement Plan is proving to be eﬀective so far. We realized almost
US$6 million of synergies in Q2 and $10 million year-to-date. We have now reached our
$25 million run rate target ahead of schedule. Savings have been realized across IT,
Investment Management, shared services and reinsurance costs. Near-term, we expect
the expense ratio to remain steady around 37%.

FINAL

On the claims front, we have already begun to internalize legal work and we expect most
of the beneﬁts to materialize towards the back end of our proﬁtability plan. With regards
to improving OneBeacon's lines of business, we are seeing good progress on the lines
undergoing proﬁtability improvement plans, but the beneﬁts are also back ended in
terms of timing. Further development was minimal in the quarter as expected and we still
have signiﬁcant capacity remaining on the adverse development cover which we
purchased at closing.
Net investment income increased 28% in Q2 to CAD134 million. Our investment team
completed the integration of OneBeacon's investment portfolio faster than anticipated
and were able to optimize the structure of the portfolio based on facts and capital
considerations across countries.
They also leveraged the transition to accelerate the reinvestment of ﬁxed income
securities at higher yields. These changes were made without increasing the risk
envelope. We now expect to report slightly north of CAD500 million in net investment
income in 2018.

Bloomberg Transcript

A few words on our balance sheet. We ended the quarter in a strong ﬁnancial position
with a total capital margin in excess of CAD1.2 billion. In Canada our MCT was two 201%
and in the US, the RBC regulatory capital stood at 405%. Both well above minimum
required levels.
During the quarter, we took advantage of positive market tone and strong investor
demand to issue CAD250 million with Reset Preferred Shares with an annual yield of
4.9%. The issue brought preferred shares to 10% of our capital structure consistent with
our long-term target. The issuance has minimal impact to net operating income per share
plus strengthening our balance sheet and providing additional capital to pursue growth
opportunities.
In conclusion, our personal auto proﬁtability plan is showing progress and the underlying
performance in our personal property and commercial lines remain solid. OneBeacon is
well on its way to meet our proﬁtability targets and establish its position as a leading
North American specialty insurer.
Overall I am very pleased with the progress shown at this quarter, but we will continue to
work and ensure the sustainability of these results.
With regards to net operating income share growth, we have multiple levers to meet our
10% growth objective. These include improving our personal auto results, the addition of
OneBeacon's earnings higher investment income and growing distribution results. In
addition, current market conditions are increasingly conducive to organic growth and
Personal Lives.
And ﬁnally we have a strong balance sheet at our disposal to capture inorganic growth
opportunities. I am therefore conﬁdent in our ability to meet our growth target over time.

FINAL

Thank you, Louis. In order to give everyone a chance to participate in the Q&A, we would
ask that you kindly limit yourselves to two questions per person. If there is time at the end
you can re-queue for a follow-up. So, Sarah, we are now ready to take questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) And your ﬁrst question comes from the line of Geoﬀ Kwan from
RBC Capital. Please go ahead.

Q - Geoﬀrey Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi, good morning. First question is on personal auto, when I think about and the level of or how should we think about your level of conviction around that your target of reaching
the mid-90s combined ratio by the end of the year like if you were to rank it on a scale of 1
to 10, how do you feel about it today and where would you've been at the start of the
year? And then also if I can ask on the year-over-year trend in the DPW or number of
insured risks, when do you expect that to start to stabilize and then maybe start to
improve?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

So to start with the last part of your question, I'll ask Darren to talk about the marketplace
as we see it now, the lag in competitive position and sort of timing you see from a top line
point of view. And then give your perspective on convictions, but I'd encourage you not
to go into a scaling.

A - Darren Christopher Godfrey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

Yes. So, thanks, Charles. So, I mean, I think initially as Charles said, deﬁnitely the market
capacity continues to tighten. So we see right momentum pretty much coast to coast from
most players. We see residual markets continuing to grow in fact, Facility Association
which is a sign that we look for in the marketplace around capacity, it was well up also in
the quarter, markets are tightening eligibility rules et cetera. So, all of this is pointing to a
continuation of the hardy market which will support our plan.
Now as far as growth is concerned, clearly when we look at sort of say in the last 24
months, even though the gap between the position that we've taken on rates and what
the industry has taken is declining that gap is declining. The industry still is a fair way
behind, but we are at sort of in an activity in the last 24 months.
So, when you look at the industry results, combined ratio as well in excess of 100%
supported by favorable PYD, clearly there's this further inadequacy within the

Page 7 of 26

Date: 2018-08-01

FINAL

marketplace. So we expect further rate increases to come from the industry. Now that
does take some time obviously, there's ﬁling processes to go through. So, while that
process continues from approval standpoint, we expect to see that, that ﬁrming up, we'll
very much continue very much in the near-term.
I think from an intact growth standpoint, you're right there, Jeﬀ, in terms of, we continue
to be challenged from a short-term standpoint. I think in the near-term as that gap on rate
shrinks we'll still see some of that pressure.
However, I would suggest though the growth opportunities will become available in the
near-term which we will be very cautious in terms of how we assess those opportunities as
we move forward on our proﬁtability action plan. But from an action plan standpoint,
we're continuing to drive rate increases. We're continuing to drive risk selection
segmentation.
So, coupled with that with the market conditions we believe we're well placed from a
proﬁtability standpoint with a growth opportunity still I would say a little bit in a few more
quarters still to come.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. I think that is a good summary. You know over a year ahead of the industry on rates
and I think that, that will take time to peer in and it's to regulate that line of business, so I
suspect that trajectory will change but not at the same speed as you see it in other lines of
business and we're quite ﬁne with that.
With regards to our conviction, when I look at the actions that were taking place, I -- my
conviction is the execution on that is north of nine and the reason why I say that is
because we've done more than what we said we do and I think, if sitting here in Q2 with
5% rate increases return and 5%-ish earning, I think that there is momentum there and
there's a lot of work done on risk selection and in that way, and team and claims are
gaining traction as well with their claims action plan.
So when I look at the execution, I'm pleased with what I see in me. People are focused
and they know that this is all hands on that. I think the -- we're seeing, we're on track to hit
the mid-90s run rate by year end, it is the - fairly a long tail line of business. There is risk
around trend and that's why I'm not going to give you an overall score, but on track is
how I would summarize where we are at this stage.

Q - Geoﬀrey Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Okay. And just quickly my second question. I think you recently increased your investment
in Metromile. And maybe thinking about that part of your business, not just Metromile,
but some of your other investments. Are there any key learnings that, that is observed
over the last sort of bit and how that may apply to your existing businesses, whether or
not in Canada or even in the US?

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

We have the number of investments in our venture portfolio that are centered. Is your
question about personal automobile or just learning in general lot of the --?

FINAL

Q - Geoﬀrey Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

We do learnings -- I know mostly investments are in the personal auto side so maybe
focus a little bit more on that I guess?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. Well, I think that the ventures are centered around data and AI, they're centered
around new forms of distribution and mobility to a certain extent. And as you know, when
we look at the very long-term future of personal automobile, we have said that what
matters here is us leading in data emission out of vehicle and telematics, us leading in
sharing which is also part of our venture strategy and keeping an eye on what's
happening on the autonomous front of thing leading into commercial automobile as well
as ownership of the car pool ships.

Q - Geoﬀrey Kwan

{BIO 7413168 <GO>}

Okay, thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

Your next question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning. And I hope you guys have a collective sigh of relief. So my ﬁrst
question is on the personal auto, which is follow-up. And I wanted to elevate that because
you mentioned the underlying seasonally adjusted 97%. If you start with 95.6% reported,
you take out the 2.3 points unfavorable and then you take up the 2 points of these one-oﬀ
items, which imply you need to sort of seasonal adjust almost 7 points. I just wonder is
that correct or not? And also can you give a little bit guidance to see what seasonal
adjustments for the third quarter and the fourth quarter as well?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

So I guess on the seasonality part, we would move it roughly between 25 points here and
it's not a precise calculation, we go back into history, short and long-term. So it's a fairly
wide range of seasonality. We would use probably 3 to 5 points of seasonality to measure
and come up with our 97%, I would say, Q2 is the --

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

97 would be at the upper end of the seasonality range.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Page 9 of 26



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2018-08-01

FINAL

Absolutely, yeah. And Q2 is also the one that has the most favorable seasonality impact.
So in providing the run rates, I think it's a fair measure to compare with where we were at
Q1. And I would say the expectations on other quarters is a bit less drastic than it has been
in Q2. So we don't -- we have not published exactly the seasonality for line of business,
but they would be certainly less important than the one we've used in Q2, which is the
most signiﬁcant seasonal diﬀerence.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay, great. And then my second question on catastrophe losses because of last three
years, you've been pretty adequate it. So I just wonder will you be able to update the 275
annual guidance or more importantly, how do you pricing in, or in recent selection these
seems to elevated level of catastrophe losses?

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Yeah. We regularly update our projected cats for many reasons for pricing as you point
out, but also to reﬂect in those projections the learnings we get from every new event.
This 275 million was updated last November.

Bloomberg Transcript

And you look at the averages over the 5 years, 10 years, 15 years and when you use that as
- if I focus on 5 years and 10 years averages over the past you need to factor in the fact
that at least two of the events during that period I'm referring to the forest ﬁres at Fort
Mac and some of the ﬂoods in 2013 and repeat periods that longer than those 5 years
and 10 years and you need to move those out.
But when you do so that's how we came to a range that was around 275 million at the end
of 2017. We will continue to update that on a regular basis. But at this point nothing points
out to a diﬀerent number with the recent experience even if it was somewhat more
elevated than that in the ﬁrst half of the year, this is a short period of time to adjust that.

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Yeah. And from a pricing standpoint as Patrick alluded to internally we did a lot of work in
terms of what is our expected level of CATs. We incorporate that very much into our
pricing strategy, but also in turn in terms of our product design as well too. So I mean, I
think that as weather evolves and if we feel as if that is a shift in weather and so forth, we
will obviously clearly look at both price and product. We're not there yet today clearly, in
terms of our expected levels to increase from a CAT standpoint. What I would say though
from thickening particularly from a personal property standpoint, yeah, even though we
do see elevated levels of CAT in Q2, this is a product that continues to be well
sustainable. We continue to see strong results from an online standpoint. Even though
Q2, even though '17 was elevated. 2017 itself turned out to be still another strong year as
well too. So our view in terms of sustainability of that particular product has not changed
at all given what we've seen in the quarter and we are well placed from a personal
property standpoint.

FINAL

And if I come back to your ﬁrst question, Kai, in terms of the impact of seasonality. You
look at the combined ratio in Q2 at 95.6 to neutralize it, or CATs or pools or PYD you get
to a combined ratio of about 91.5 to 92, okay. And then Louis, talks about the seasonality
range of 3% to 5%, we sort of go at the upper end of the range you go from 92 to 97. So
that's sort of how we're thinking about it and giving you a sense for where we think we are
and the fact that we are on track to hit the mid '90s clearly given where we are now by the
end of the year.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

So, if frequency severity remains favorable there is a possibility you could overshot to the
95% target by year-end?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

You know, where if I sum up, where I think we are, I'd say on track.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay, great. Good luck.

Your next question comes from the line of Tom MacKinnon from BMO Capital. Please go
ahead.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Yeah. Just two quick questions. One with respect to in personal property I know in the
quarter, you talked about an increase in large ﬁre losses, that certainly has been
something that is in the news of late. So maybe you can talk about some of the large ﬁre
losses that are happening this summer. And what you see as impacting your results, if any
for the third quarter, and I have a follow-up?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yes, Tom, let me ask Patrick, who is keeping an eye on these things to give you his
perspective.

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Yeah. So maybe the ﬁrst thing to clarify is the ﬁre losses we are referring to for Q2 are
single ﬁres, not really related to the forest ﬁres that we have seen in the news, so that our
two diﬀerent thing. There has been -- whether has been good and dry which created
more forest ﬁres overall in Canada.

Page 11 of 26



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp
Company Ticker: IFC CN Equity
Date: 2018-08-01

So far this year more than a thousand have been active at diﬀerent point in times. Most of
them are quickly put under control. Right now, there's about 30 of those ﬁres that are said
to be not fully under control. Only two of them are representing potential threat to living
you know surrounding communities, one in Northern Ontario and one in Central B.C.

FINAL

But they're still quite far from the communities. We're monitoring all of them on the -- on a
daily basis. And -- but no imminent threats from the existing forest ﬁres at the moment.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

And of that, I think your guidance for CAT losses, is that still in the 275 million annually, is
that --?

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

And you expect half of those generally to be in the third quarter, is that right?

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Yeah, we haven't really changed that.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Given you know that we had higher than expected CAT losses in the ﬁrst quarter and in
the second quarter. Do you think is it necessary to revisit this 275 number. I mean,

Yeah. So we talk about this every quarter, but the reality is we've updated it in November,
re-updating it within the year given that we base ourselves on long-term averages would
be a bit too fast.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

And it doesn't take long. Although we expect Q3 to be half because of historical statistics,
it may not be that way. So I think, it would be fair for us to really take another good look at
the end of November, a year after we've updated the last years and update that if
necessary.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

I understood.

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Yeah. And, I think, Tom that that's your observation on a quarterly basis is right in my view.
When I look at personal prop and I look at the last ﬁve years, so six months into the year
into 2018 in personal prop combined ratio is 96, okay.
In 2017, for the whole year, 89, in 2016, 91, in 2015, 86, in 2014, 89, so caps are creating
noise, but it's overall been helping the demand for the product. And I think, the product is
priced to do well in periods of caps. I understand it is indeed noisy and that's why we
often disclose if we think disclosure is towards the end of the quarter to make sure that
most of you are on it or all of you.

we continue to assess where we can take rate increases. We continue to ﬁle very slowly
from province to province, but where we feel as if market conditions are suﬃcient such
that we feel as if we can take rate, and also there is a need for take rate.

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Yeah. There's obviously sometimes - I mean you're right, Charlie, in terms of Ontario
numbers are out, the Alberta numbers are out, sometimes we will see quarter-overquarter a little bit of diﬀerence between our actions and the industry actions, sometimes
there is timing diﬀerences, sometimes like you know for example, in Q2 on the ﬁscal
numbers, it'll show minimal rent increases from us, but you'll also see that we took more
in Q1. So, you see a little bit of noise there.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Well, you know, overall, I'll say this. So the market is ﬁrming up. There is a big line to catch
up before our price point is becoming competitive. We are open to growth at our
conditions and we are still on the mindset of getting rate where needed, or where we can.
And therefore we have plans for the fall as well as '19 and we're working on that.

Q - Meny Grauman

{BIO 15238080 <GO>}

Hi, good afternoon. Just a question on physical damage costs. If you could just talk to that
speciﬁcally and so, any commentary for the quarter especially, when it comes to the rate
of inﬂation and how that's tracking the 4% trend?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah, Patrick?

A - Patrick Barbeau

{BIO 18476397 <GO>}

Yeah. So we've talked about physical damage pressure in costs in the past. It's been -- for
at a time even somewhat higher than the 4% you're quoting. We said that in Q2, it was
actually a decrease in overall security in cost for auto.
And when I look speciﬁcally at the cost of PD, our action plans and claims was targeting
three main components of that PD cost that was the actual cost of the parts and repairs,
there's the cost of rentals and towing fees and there's also some other fees around
storage for total loss and all that. And we're working on all three fronts.

Page 14 of 26



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp

FINAL

What we see in Q2 is that well, those plans we're targeting to temper the inﬂation and we
see that the inﬂation coming from the cost of parts and cost of repairs is still there. But,
some of our actions have brought them down and I can give you a few examples of what
we're starting to see in Q2 from claims perspective.
One key example is the cost of rentals. We have reduced our cycle time by close to two
full days with our action plans and repairs and total loss. That has reduced the rental cost
by slightly more than 10%.
Compared to prior quarters and this is a key portion because we can actually benchmark
ourselves with the industry and we see that that reduction has created a bigger gap
between us and the industry so that a portion of the severity trend that we can link back
directly to our actions.
From an actual cost of repair perspective, we've seen the cost of repair over also parts
and labor together slightly go down year-on-year in Q2, which is the ﬁrst quarter we've
seen that in a while. So, we can link back some of those components.
So, overall, this quarter the severity was actually down, but we're seeing a good portion of
that coming directly from our actions. There might be some situations from quarter-toquarter that explains the rest.

Q - Meny Grauman

{BIO 15238080 <GO>}

Thanks, Patrick. And if I could just ask another question on just the regulatory landscape,
we had an election in Ontario. It sounds like especially in Ontario, but across the country
it's pretty benign, but I'm wondering if there's any speciﬁc regulatory issues that are on
your radar screen, anything that you're worried about?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Darren, why don't you give your perspective on the regulatory landscape from coast-tocoast focused on automobile insurance?

A - Darren Christopher Godfrey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

Yeah. I mean, you're right, we haven't really seen material changes in the regulatory
landscape, but honestly as you alluded to election in Ontario, it's still very early days, it's
still going through a transition obviously both from an ISP standpoint and from an industry
standpoint, very big proponents of the March report so we're really gearing up from a GR
standpoint there, but otherwise really no other signiﬁcant changes.
The only other maybe the subtle change that I would mention would be in Alberta in
particular, the government bought out a slight amendment to the minor injury deﬁnitions
in Alberta.
So, really as we've talked about in the past two issues in Alberta around minor injuries,
one is TMJ and the other one is around chronic pain. I'm very much simplifying, but that
Page 15 of 26



Company Name: Intact Financial Corp

FINAL

were the two sort of major streams. So they brought about a change in a minor injury
deﬁnition, really addressing the TMJ issue to a fair degree. And these were eﬀective on
June 1, so all claims post June 1 would now apply under this new deﬁnition.
When we look at Alberta, when we look at the industry's results for Alberta and the
inadequacies that exist there in the industry, there's more work that still needs to be done
from an MIR standpoint, but we're encouraged to see early signs about the government
addressing some of the cost pressures that we see in Alberta. So that's probably the only I
would say the change that we've seen from a regulatory environment in the last quarter

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah,I think that's exactly right, Darren. I will add that in dialogue over the years with the
party in power in Ontario, they've been very receptive to the notion that automobile
insurance is very, very competitive. And that making changes to the approval process to
unleash competitive forces to a greater extent is seen as a good thing.

Bloomberg Transcript

And therefore I think this is an area where I'm hoping that we will in the context of the
Ontario marketplace have a more dynamic sort of pricing environment that would be
good I think for consumers in the long run. And I think the party in power certainly gets
that.
I think that when I think about the political and regulatory landscape from coast to coast at
the moment, and I look back to our experience as a ﬁrm going through cycles, I would say
that we're in a period that indeed appears to be benign from a regulatory point of view.
But we're in a period, where the market is ﬁrming up meaningfully and that means, rates
are going up across the land.
It means that capacity is tightening up a number of insurers who sat on their hands as
inﬂation was catching up with them who sat on their hands when it comes to taking rate
actions are sitting out there not really wanting to write business at the moment.
This tends to fuel growth in non-standard or residual markets which we've highlighted.
We've seen growth in that segment. We've mentioned that to you guys in the past couple
of quarters and this elevates the tension so to speak.
There's no meaningful issues at this stage, but it is a riskier regulatory environment when
capacity is tightening up and we're working with regulators across the land to make sure
they understand the environment and also what they can do about it to improve the
dynamics of the marketplace and I do believe that the change that Darren's talked about
in Alberta is a very concrete sign, the government seeing inﬂation, seeing the market
tightening up a bit and doing their part to improve the availability of driving for Albertans
and therefore, I'm encouraged by that.

Q - Meny Grauman

Your next question comes from the line of Mario Mendonca from TD Securities. Please go
ahead.

FINAL

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Good morning. Just a quick question. First Louis, you concluded your comments with you reiterated the 10% growth in net operating EPS. Now, what I'm trying to understand is,
was -- would you suggest that that applies to 2019. And the reason I'm asking the question
is, there's so much that went poorly early on in 2018, the cat losses, the usually bad
weather, the - all the signiﬁcant improvements you're making to auto, there's a good long
list that can go, if you're not the least of which is OneBeacon as well, that would suggest
2019 has to be a lot better than 10%. So I'm asking you is, when you talked about the 10%,
you emphasized it. Were you trying to send us a signal that the 10% is relevant in 2019 or
is there some other message here?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

Well, I think I was - I'm not trying to give speciﬁc for guidance for 2019, I was trying to
share the elements of upside that we see as levers. The conditions are favorable, as
Charles alluded to and also growth is clearly a key target for us. And we certainly are
working on those levers to make sure that we get to that target over time. But I was not
very speciﬁc, I was not pointing at 2019.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

No. I think the reason why we like that objective is because it's not a plain growth
objective. It's an objective that has a number of levers to move the needle. And I would
say when I look at where we are right now, on each of those levers, I see upside. What can
drive NOIPS growth, organic growth? Well, the market is ﬁrming up. Automobile on 12
months you should see better organic growth there, we've seen commercial lines is
growing at 7% at the moment. So when I look at the NOIPS component, the organic
growth lever is certainly purely positive. When I look at margins, we're working hard on
auto, OneBeacon is improving and property and commercial lines are doing well. So I
look favorably at this lever as well.
When I look at capital, we have a strong capital base. There's a lot of opportunities in the
market. I'm hoping we can use our capital base to be a accretive to earnings as well. And
so, not at all moments in the cycle you have all the levers lined up to contribute to nice
growth and I think this is a point in time where most of those levers should move in the
same positive direction. Won't go beyond that to talk about a number, but I would say
that there was good alignment between what can move the NOIPS here very clearly.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

So bottom line for both of you, the 10% was not a reference 2019?

FINAL

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Okay. Let me move on to something else then. Maybe you've already discussed this, I
missed it. There was references last quarter to reserve development personal auto being
neutral. And this quarter, obviously didn't work out that way. So a couple of things. What - what played out this quarter that was disappointing? And then secondly what's your
outlook?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Ken, do you want to give your perspective.

A - Kenneth Anderson

{BIO 16846692 <GO>}

The activity - the adverse development we've seen in Q2 for personal auto was limited to
accident beneﬁt coverage in Ontario as limited to a large part and more speciﬁcally to a
couple accident years prior to the reform of June 2016. Clearly, people are trying to get as
much as they can from their claims or before the new regime. But that has a - there's a
limit to that as we close more and more of the ﬁles from those prior years.

Bloomberg Transcript

And from a claims perspective, when we get those requests, we are being careful at the
moment in our reserve and we're putting up the reserve. That's really what happened in
Q2, really isolated to one line of business and it might be important to mention that the
type of claims that has developed in Q2 are speciﬁcally linked to what the reform of 2016
is trying to address.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah. I think that's a very good way to put it. It is surgical and it is people and
entrepreneurs so to speak trying to get the most out of the previous regime pre-reform.
Now the thing we're observing Mario that we're not giving full credibility to at this stage is
that, while there is more demand for CATs and accident beneﬁt for those two accident
years. The demands that actually translates into CATs or what I would call the concession
rate for CATs is actually coming down. And that is only partially reﬂected in how we're
reserving.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

The concession rate being what you will accept as a CAT.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Exactly.

Q - Mario Mendonca

{BIO 2450557 <GO>}

Usually and that's coming down. So that's a positive, but generally reﬂected there yet.

or unfavorable?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I'd say neutral and it can go either way, it's a right way to think about it neutral and in
aggregate for the organization we've guided towards 2% to 4% at the lower end of that
range in the near to mid-term in part because of interest rates which put some lead to a
lower provision for adverse deviation. And in part because of the period we're in, in
automobile insurance at the moment when we're taking a cautious look at some of the
improvements we're seeing.

Your next question comes from the line of Doug Young from Desjardins Capital. Please go
ahead.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Good morning. Just following on that question around the prior year reserve
developments. And again what you said Charles about concessions and what not, but is
there any way to put this in, in diﬀerent perspective in terms of meaning how many pre2016 Ontario auto claim ﬂows are left open. What's the closing rate that we're going
through? And are you assuming essentially in most of these cases, the worst potential
outcome from the CAT stocking, or is there any other way to kind of put this in
perspective?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Tricky to get into numbers. The point I'm making is that it's not because you say, you're
being catastrophically injured that you actually are, right. I mean, there was a certain
stream of catastrophically injured people that needed real care.
And then, when the reforms came in June 2016 reducing the ability to claim psychological
damage as a trigger to become catastrophically injured. We've seen, now that people
claim that to a much greater extent and entrepreneurs working around the automobile

FINAL

insurance base do that and our acceptance of those claim is coming down and we're only
partially giving credibility for this.
Now the numbers we're talking about are actually very small numbers but as you know a
cat in automobile insurance is worth CAD1 million or more, where the stage before and
which is called basic claim would be in the tens of thousands of dollars. So to actually put
a number on the number of cats that one can get, I mean, it's pence of cats. It's not
hundreds nor thousands, they swing but 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 of them are worth CAD10 million.
And that's the sort of swings you're seeing in the results and we're taking them to a
certain extent at face value for now until we see that those reforms become eﬀective and
until we see that the concession rate actually holds at a lower level. But it's - you know
Doug, I'll take your question into consideration and either ahead of roadshows or ahead
of next quarter, we'll think of a diﬀerent way to present it if there is a good one that can be
publicly disclosed.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I appreciate that. The second is just back to the 97% that you were talking about, I mean, I
guess the simple way to think of it for Q4 or for Q3 or Q4 is, we take the combined ratio,
we back up the prior year reserve development, we back up the cat, so you get to a
current year accident combined ratio. And if that current year accident combined ratio is
97% or better and if it's 97%, Charles that you're saying basically, you would say that you
hit your target in terms of a run rate mid-90% combined ratio, is that essentially the way to
think of this?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

That's, yeah, that's not a bad way to think of this. I'm not sure I'd say that at 97%, Doug,
but right because when we say mid we're sort of thinking about mid here, but that would
be a good way to do this. In aggregate, we want the line to be in that space all-in just to
be clear.
When we track our progress, we're trying to make sure that the one-oﬀs don't cloud our
read where we are one way or another and I think we just laid out very clearly that if you
take the upper end of what we view as seasonality range this is how we think about how
much more work is needed at this stage and we think that what's in the pipeline will get
us there and that's why I conclude here that we're on track.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

So, I guess that's why I'm getting confused. Just like is 97, and the 95, or is it essentially in
Q4, you basically you want the auto combined ratio to be 95?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

You know, I think we want the run rate in Q4 to be in the mid '90s, when you take
seasonality into consideration, basically.

Q - Doug Young

{BIO 5640851 <GO>}

Okay. And then just lastly, just you mentioned the risk-sharing pools a few times and it
looks like the residual market looks like the results have been ﬁne. But the risk-sharing
pools I guess when I look at the expected combined ratio for this year is about 167% and
as you mentioned this pool is growing. So and I know I've asked this before and hopefully
we can kind of get a little bit of a diﬀerent ﬂavor to it. But does that concern you and if
not, why not? And I know you probably put in business in that is higher combined ratio,
but net-net it's not a drag and as you mentioned it's a 1 point drag year-over-year on the
current year loss ratio in personal auto. So I'm just hoping to get a little color.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I think it is true that the pools, the business that is in the pool is performing poorly. But
what matters is, how poor a business you seen in the pool compared to the business
that's in the pool, and our track record from that point of view has been very good. In fact,
we've been ceding worse business and the business that there is in the pool. And I don't
think the pool is actually a structural drag to our performance. And Darren, you might
want to share your perspective on this.

A - Darren Christopher Godfrey

{BIO 19791482 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

No, absolutely. I think a little bit more context I can provide there. Within the quarter itself,
so Q2-over-Q2, yes, we did talk about pools did impact the current accident year by a 1
point. But pools also favorably impacted the PYD for a 1 point. So if you're looking in
aggregate in particular in the quarter, pools had zero impact in totality in Q2.
Now, when we look year-to-date, pools are actually favorably impacting our combined
ratio by roughly 0.6 points which is very much in line with our long-term expectations.
We're going to see -- as we have seen in the past, we're going to see some noise from
quarter-to-quarter. We're going to see noise between current accident year and prior
accident years that will continue.
Obviously, there's an element of the pools as you talk about the assumed element that
we're not reserving that, that's coming from the industry. So we do tend to get a little bit
of noise. I would expect that. But pools itself historically and also year-to-date, I think, are
a source of gain for us from a combined ratio standpoint.

expected loss trend in those liability lines? And are there any US liability trends you're
keeping an eye on?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Well, I would say right now on the liability trends that we're keeping an eye on, although
we're very little aﬀected well, but we're looking at it is everything regarding sexual
harassments. On the sexual harassment side, we have no coverage on our D&O business,
but we have a bit of coverage on the management liability side. And clearly that's
something where, although, with small increase in number of losses, but there is are -normally very small one. This is clearly a trend we're looking at right now. And this is one
of the line of business where we're taking action plan to address some of the issue we
have in management liability.

Q - Christopher Campbell

frequency trends. Just in terms of what you would be modeling long term on either
frequency or severity versus where those are coming in currently?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

No. You know, when you look at the US and number of the players in the automobile
insurance space, there seems to have been a decline in frequency at least for those that
are publicly traded that we're tracking. There has been no such equivalent decline and
frequency. Here we've seen mild inﬂation when it comes to frequency, but no structural
changes, as it's been observed for a few of the US players in the past couple of years.

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

Yeah. It was very quick, you talked about the 1.2 billion of capital and given that
integration on OB, it sounds like it's complete now. What can you say in terms of your
aggressiveness pursuing M&A transactions? And what type of businesses would you
potentially be looking to?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, let me just comment on your conclusion that the integration of OB is completed. I
think that we're ahead of schedule on synergies. I think the investment team has done a
great job faster than we thought to optimize and integrate the investment mix which has
both income and expense beneﬁts. We're not done. There's more work to be done in
particular on synergies and a few areas, but when it comes to our underwriting and claims
improvement plan, we don't think we're at the end of this.
In fact, we think we're right in the middle of the improvement plan there. We're pleased
with the traction we're seeing. I mean our folks in the US are really good at executing on
these plans and there's a lot of focus and I think it translates into a 93.8% combined ratio
in Q2, but what we're looking for is sustainable top quartile low 90s combined ratio.
And I would say 93.8% is not that as far as I'm concerned, and sustainability will take some
time. We're quite encouraged by what we're seeing, and gaining conﬁdence that we will
indeed deploy capital in the US, but the integration is not over. I think that we've got a few
more months of work there before we reach that conclusion. Louis, anything you want to
add?

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

No, I think the capital position is strong. Something came up in Canada, of course, we
deleverage our balance sheet to do it, or use our balance sheet to do it, that remains a
priority, whether it's manufacturing or distribution. But I think you're right on, I think we
have to be cautious and the integration is not yet completed, although we are seeing
good progress.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Yeah, I think where we are conﬁdent is that when you look at the US business, there's 14
diﬀerent business segments. And some are there and sustainable and great performance
in fact the majority of them. And would we do tuck-in acquisition to strengthen some of

these segments? We might, because there we have the conﬁdence. But I would say large
or broad acquisitions at this stage, I would say it's too early.

FINAL

Q - Jaeme Gloyn

{BIO 19737597 <GO>}

Okay. So small tuck-in, in the US specialty line would be the focus there. And then in
Canada, I mean, I see that post quarter there's been a couple of brokers picked up for
broker link. Is that still more the focus and then potentially anything else on the M&A
side?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

So, let me just come back. I think prior to number one in terms of meaningful capital
deployment is Canada. And Canada manufacturing, Canada distribution no doubt and
starting to think about tuck-ins in the US for the segments where we feel comfortable.
Louis?

On the distribution front. So it was a bit of a tame ﬁrst half of the year, little activity picked
up just after the end of the quarter as you've seen with the few acquisitions on the
BrokerLink front. So of course this can be lumpy, we've said that in the past. There's still
plenty of opportunities in the market, we're active on it and the proof is, we've concluded
three year but just after quarter end, so we'll deploy capital there as the opportunities are
available and I intend to continue on that front.

Your next question comes from the line of Brenna Phelan from Raymond James. Please go
ahead.

Q - Brenna Phelan

{BIO 20108118 <GO>}

Hi, good morning.

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Hello.

Q - Brenna Phelan

{BIO 20108118 <GO>}

I just wanted to follow-up on Geoﬀ's question on Metromile. And as you invest more
capital in that business and spend some more time there. Do you think there is a sense for
a pay-per-use Intact Insurance product in Canada? Are you any closer to that decision?

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

Well. It's important to keep in mind that Metromile's approach to business is one that very
much relies on telematics. And I would say that it's important to keep in mind that we
have a huge telematics program in Canada that is focused on behavior ﬁrst and foremost
where Metromile's is focused on driving - on the amount of driving you're doing.

And we've got four billion kilometers driven leveraging artiﬁcial intelligence to ﬁnd new
ways to promote and so take risk with that product and are very much focused on that.
But this is a platform that is evolving and I'll let Darren share with you where we are and
some of the latest deployments we have made in telematics.

FINAL

A - Louis Marcotte

{BIO 18040440 <GO>}

No. That's exactly it, Charles, and to obviously, using that CAD4 billion - sorry, four billion
kilometers of kilometers that we referred to, we're continuing to evolve the program.
We're continuing to improve the sophistication of the program, not just from a behavior
standpoint, but in fact, actually from a kilometer standpoint as well too.
So I think, that as we look at our telematics program, where we're soon launching a new
iteration of the program. We're in research for the next iteration of the program as well
too. So we're quickly continually, I would say evolving the program and assessing both
from a segmentation standpoint, but also from a product position standpoint as well.

Q - Brenna Phelan

{BIO 20108118 <GO>}

Okay, great. That's helpful. And then, just last one. The accident beneﬁts related prior
development in Ontario, give us sense, is this an industry wide phenomenon or your
competitors feeling the pain here? And do you think there's a chance that as we near the
end of one, these claims can actually be ﬁled do you think there's a chance that there is
maybe one more last surge over the next year?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Charles Brindamour

{BIO 7012323 <GO>}

I think the risk of surging is diminishing given the reforms were introduced two years ago.
And I do think it is an industry wide issue absolutely.

Q - Brenna Phelan

{BIO 20108118 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks very much.
