Good morning, everyone. It's a great pleasure to welcome you today to our second
Investor Day that is being webcast -- broadcast live.
The first one last year was a great success and a comprehensive event. Following your
suggestions, we have decided this year to focus in the issues that have raised the most
interest during the last year. These subjects are the evolution of our strategic plan; our
capital management policy; of course, the impact of the reinsurance -- the catastrophe
events during the third Q; and also, our operations in the international business and -- with
a special focus in North America region. The presentations have already been uploaded in
the CNMV web. And also in our website in Spanish and in English.
Today, we have here with us MAPFRE's Chairman and CEO, Antonio Huertas. Good
morning, Antonio.

Antonio Huertas MejÃ­as
Thank you, Natalia. Good morning, again, everyone. And thank you for joining us for this
Investor Day, proof of MAPFRE's firm commitment to strengthening our relationship with
our investors and stakeholders.
Let me start by giving a quick overview of the main figures of the company as it stands in
the last period we have published, the Third Quarter which, as you already know, were
affected by severe cat events.

FINAL

Last quarter, we concluded the first half of the 3-year cycle of our profitable growth
strategy. This strategy is being deployed throughout the group. And there are units that
already show a sustainable growth in premiums and a very significant improvement in
their profitability.
This growth model started a couple of years ago in Spain. And there, you can see the
result. Premiums are growing well above the market, around 4%. We have beaten the
market in almost all businesses. And profits has grown close to 10%. Spain Life business is
also performing extremely well, with outstanding performance in the bancassurance
channel.
MAPFRE RE continues contributing positively to business volumes, even in the context of
the recent catastrophes, as we will explain clearly throughout today's presentation. Our
profitable growth strategy is also seen in other markets such as Peru, Colombia, Turkey
and Italy among others, with very significant improvements in the result. On the other
hand, the process of progress towards greater profitability in larger markets such as
Brazil, Mexico and the United States, continues.

Bloomberg Transcript

As you know, there has been an exceptional concentration of natural catastrophes in this
Third Quarter that have not occurred in decades, both by their magnitude and by the
coincidence in time. We will view more information on this topic. But it's important to
emphasize it. Despite the exceptional nature of these events, we are talking about
something that is inherent part of our insurance: protecting our insured against those
risks.
What's relevant is the proven financial capacity and solvency of MAPFRE to respond to our
policyholders as we are doing. It's also important to highlight the effectiveness of
reinsurance protection that MAPFRE has against this type of event and how this limit the
impact on the group's results and equity.
On this, we can say that the specific impact of the catastrophe does not alter the
evolution of the company. That it is still performing very well in line with our strategy.
We stand by our net impact estimate of EUR 176 million which we gave in September.
Eduardo Perez De Lema, the CEO of MAPFRE RE, will be able to break down for you
some of the gross impact estimates we are starting to obtain, which could rise to EUR 1.1
billion.
In the next few minutes, our CFO, Fernando Mata, will also update you on our financial
position and the evolution of our investment strategy. As we've repeatedly told you, the
main focus of MAPFRE's capital management is to maintain capital levels and consistent
dividends.
In that regard, MAPFRE is working towards meeting its commitment of a stable and
growing shareholder remuneration. Final dividend against 2017 result will be announced in
February 2018 and approved at the shareholders' meeting to be held in March.

FINAL

Solvency position and the diversified balance sheet are some of our defining features.
Moreover, our asset allocation policies are successfully managing financial returns for us,
even in the low-interest rate environment, with high accounting yields and flexibility to
take advantage of market opportunities for harvesting gains.
We are also -- to make the most of this meeting, to update you on the restructuring we
have already decided for our American -- North American business. Going forward, we will
focus our operations on fewer states in the U.S. We will reinforce our market leadership
position in our home state, Massachusetts.
We will focus on our core markets and line of business. And drive our profitable growth
strategy in the states where we remain operating. This means we will exit 5 states: New
York, New Jersey, Kentucky, Tennessee and Indiana.
At the same time, we are implementing a digital transformation of our operations there,
which includes the recent launch of our VERTI brand in the state of Pennsylvania, offering
auto insurance to digital customers. Alfredo Castelo, our CEO of MAPFRE North America,
will explain all the details to you in a moment.

Bloomberg Transcript

And finally, we are going to dive a little deeper into our businesses in Europe, which are, in
general, registering a remarkable turnaround in profitability compared to previous years.
Our CEO in the International Territorial Area, which includes North America, EMEA and
APAC, Jaime Tamayo, will explain to you shortly what the outlook is for our business in
Turkey, where profits are up 120% in local currency terms; Italy, where net result is up 71%
on the previous year; Germany, which is developing a solid business model with a new
brand and diversifying into digital Life insurance; and Malta that continues its sustained
value creation, thanks to its leadership in both Life and Non-Life insurance.
Also, we have already cited the creation of a new subregion in the LATAM North region,
which brings together all the MAPFRE businesses' activities in Central America and in
Dominican Republic.
Now I would like to continue reviewing the main points of our 3-year strategic plan. Our
main goal is to achieve profitable growth through 4 main pillars, which are shown here:
client orientation; digital transformation, comprising both digital business and also the
digitalization of our processes; technical and operational excellence; and lastly,
developing our internal culture and talent.
The 2016-'18 plan shows, thus far, quite satisfactory development, with almost all the
projects in progress and 75% of the indicators on schedule.
The strategic plan also incorporates a number of financial objectives, some of which I
have already mentioned. Let's take a closer look at them again now.

FINAL

We've set the goal of about 5% annual average revenue growth, with premiums growing
being the main driver. We have recently said that we may not achieve the 3-year average
ROE target due to the short-line frequency of cat losses during the Third Quarter of 2017.
But obviously, we will work hard to improve it as much as possible, as we will keep our
dividends payout between 50% and 65% of profits.
In relation to the objective centered of the client, I have to say that, firstly, we have
reached a 65% perceived quality NPS rating in line with the 3-year average. Secondly, we
have increased our Non-Life market share in 54% of our markets, a little below
expectations. More commercial activity will be required in the near future to get this goal
on track.
Regarding digital transformation, we can say that we have increased digital transactions in
Spain, Brazil, U.S. and Mexico by 20%. So we are on track to meet this objective. Digital
business has increased by 33%, compared with a cumulative target of 50% for the 3-year
period plan through the MAPFRE, VERTI and InsureandGo brands.

Bloomberg Transcript

Moving on the technical and operational management excellence, it should be noted that
the combined ratio was 98.7% at September 2017. But excluding the Third Quarter cat
events, this ratio would have improved by nearly 1percentage point to 97.3% (sic) (96.3%).
We will step up our efforts to improve on this objective over the last quarter of the year.
The expense ratio was 28.1%, aligned with the 3-year average objective of 28%,
demonstrating the success of the cost-containment program. We estimate that savings
exhibit EUR 60 million during the first year of the plan. And probably the same amount on
the second year.
In terms of digital dispatch to service provider, which is a fully automated system without
human integration to dispatch tow trucks and home assistant, we reached -- 73.6% of
total services were provided in this way, comfortably exceeding the goal.
Referring to culture and talent, I have to say that we have obtained a great place to work
score of 72%. We will need to pull out the stops to ensure that we reach -- we will reach
our ultimate objective in 2018.
With regard to equality policies, women already occupy 38.8% of managerial positions
compared with an objective of 40% for the 3-year period. Our inclusive policies are also
bearing fruit, as we have already reached 1.6% of people with disabilities integrated in our
global workforce, with the relevant objective being 2% by 2018.
In 2016, the employee internal mobility rate was slightly higher than our 10% objective.
And we continue on the same line.
And now let's delve into the different topics that I have just outlined. At the end of the
event, it will be my pleasure to address you again to deliver the closing remarks on digital
transformation.

Let's start with Fernando Mata, our CFO, who will provide you with an overview of how
MAPFRE creates value through its capital management. Please, Fernando, the floor is
yours.

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Thank you, Antonio. Good morning, everybody, especially those that are logging in from
America. Unfortunately, you got up earlier than usual. But hopefully, I mean, this
presentation will be of your interest.
Probably, I mean, that my presentation will be shorter than expected. The only purpose is
just to give more time to the main topics of the Investor Day is the catastrophe
reinsurance protection and also the restructuring in the U.S.A.
But before going into the main topics of the Investor Day presentation, I would like to take
a quick look at MAPFRE's solvency and capital management. As we have mentioned in the
past, the main focus is to maintain capital levels in line with Solvency II and ratings targets.
And also to pay stable dividends.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the left side, you can see the composition of the capital structure at September 2017,
amounting to EUR 13.2 billion. The largest component is equity with 82% of the total. Our
debt structure is very well diversified between senior and subordinated debt. And also
the syndicated credit facility.
On the right side, you've got the leverage information. Our leverage is 18%, which, as you
know, is lower than our peers. The bottom, you have Solvency II figures that confirm
MAPFRE's strong capital position and low volatility in line with, you got on the left, the
200% target, with 25percentage point upper and lower limits for tolerance.
The Solvency II ratio at September stood at 190%. This is provisional figures. There is -we're still doing some checkups. But the figure will be around this amount. The reduction
in eligible funds is in line with the decrease in the IFRS equity. The ratio, as we said, is
based on a high-quality capital structure with 93% Tier 1 capital.
As you know, MAPFRE feels quite comfortable with this capital structure, leverage and
solvency levels. All of these give us significant stability and financial flexibility for the future.
Moving on to our equity base, as you can see in the graph on the top of this slide, our
equity base has grown 4% on average over the last five years, while we saw almost 4%
decrease as well in 2017 due to the reduction in net income from cat losses occurring in
the Third Quarter and also negative currency differences.
There are 2 factors that generate, let's say, unexpected volatility in our equity: the first is
the unrealized gains on our available-for-sale portfolio and the second is currency
conversion differences from the units operating in non-euro currencies. As you know, in

Page 6 of 44



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2017-12-01

general, we do not hedge currency risk. We match assets and liability in the local balance
sheets. So we need to retain part of our earnings to mitigate this volatility.

FINAL

The graph on the bottom shows the trend of unrealized gains and conversion differences
over the last five years. As you can see, historically, there has been a negative correlation
between these 2 factors. The available-for-sale portfolio has been more stable, while the
currency conversion differences have suffered more volatility.
As you can see in the chart, in 2015, the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar and the fall
in the Brazilian real caused a large decrease in our equity of approximately EUR 500
million, which, by the way, recovered in 2016, thanks to the strong appreciation of the
Brazilian real and, again, the positive evolution of the U.S. dollar.
In 2017, unrealized gains have remained quite stable, while, again, negative currency
conversion differences grew substantially. We'll take a closer look at these changes on the
next slide.

Bloomberg Transcript

2017 has been strongly impacted by the significant depreciation of both the U.S. dollar and
the Brazilian real, as well as minor negative effects from the rest of currencies. In fact, the
Mexican peso was the only currency that increased in value against the euro. In the chart,
we show the change in main currencies that caused a decrease in our net equity of EUR
526 million to date. The largest impact by far was coming from the U.S. dollar.
In the column on the right, we present the equity sensitivity analysis for the main
currencies, which -- with, again, the U.S. dollar being the most relevant. The way we should
read this column is a 10% change in currency, for instance, will cause a 2.7% change in our
equity for the U.S. dollar; and the remaining for the Brazilian real, 1.1%. And so on.
Let's move to investment management. Regarding investment management, MAPFRE
has successfully managed its investments in a low interest rate scenario, with excellent
financial returns, high accounting yields and flexibility to take advantage of market
opportunities to harvest, to realize capital gains.
We have rebalanced our portfolio aiming for higher yields and diversification. In 2017, as
you see on the screen, the weight of equity, ETFs and mutual funds increased by
2percentage points, while reducing Spanish fixed income in same amount. Our actively
managed portfolios are performing above market returns, with stable accounting yields.
Regarding realized gains. To September 2017, we have realized over EUR 120 million in
capital gains. And we have still EUR 175 million of unrealized equity gains, giving us a
cushion for the Fourth Quarter of next year.
We are also looking to increase our weight in alternative investments, with approximately
EUR 450 million commitment until 2019, the end of 2018, with the end of the 3-year
strategic plan, of which 2,000 -- sorry, EUR 210 million is already invested in this year, in

Page 7 of 44



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2017-12-01

2017. A large share of these investments is allocated to core European real estate. And
the expected yield is approximately 4%.

FINAL

Our asset management business is performing well, with 12% growth year-to-date. The
Luxembourg Sicav will reach EUR 500 million by year-end; and Mapfre GestiÃ³n
Patrimonial, it's the new unit, reached its EUR 200 million annual target already in
September.
Finally. And this is very important for us, MAPFRE also recognizes the importance of
sustainable and responsible investing. As you know, we have changed our investment
policy this year to include this matter. And we also signed our -- the United Nations
Responsible Investment Principles. And recently, we took a stake in La Financiere
Responsable, a French boutique asset manager specialized in ECG (sic) (ESG),
environmental, social and government investing.
Now let's talk about the real estate portfolio and also the management actions for the
last years. At September, MAPFRE had over EUR 2.2 billion in real estate investment at
gross value, with almost EUR 570 million in unrealized gains, which, by the way, they're
included in the Solvency II eligible funds but not under IFRS equity.

Bloomberg Transcript

We have always followed a strategy of actively rotating our investments according to the
economic cycle and the market opportunities. As you can see in the chart on the bottom,
when the real estate crisis hit Spain, we wrote down almost EUR 200 million, it happened
in 2012 and 2013, especially in the undeveloped land portfolio. As you know, we left these
business lines, residential business. And we focused on commercial units since that day.
The chart, it's very important to mention, also shows that no relevant depreciation was
booked in recent years. We are pretty optimistic with the future trend, especially in
commercial units and in large cities in Europe. So we can expect some future releases of
provisions regarding real estate.
On the left side, you can see the different activities carried out during the last years. In
2015, we resumed commercial activity with relevant acquisitions, one was abroad in
Boston and the other was the acquisition of the Plaza de Independencia building in
Madrid. And also, we made relevant sales in 2016, the iconic building of the MAPFRE
Tower in Barcelona and also, the sale of the Luchana building as well in Madrid.
I have to say, this is important as well. But both buildings, they stayed longer than 20 years
in our balance sheet and it was time to rotate the units.
In conclusion, we strongly believe that real estate is a complementary investment,
providing capital stability to the group, stable financial income and also opportunities to
realize capital gains in the future.
Now let's talk about cash flow upstreaming in MAPFRE Group. It has been one of the
questions you've raised in -- during our meetings. Our policy -- first, I have to say, our
Page 8 of 44



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2017-12-01

policy governing cash flows include 3 main principles you got on the bottom.

FINAL

First, dividends upstreamed from operating units to holding company must cover MAPFRE
S.A. dividend, holding expenses, overheads. And capital needs of loss-making units.
Second, operating units must retain enough capital to finance their organic growth. And
third, debt should only be used to finance acquisitions.
In the charts, we present this year cash flow forecast, which comprises over EUR 750
million upstreamed from subsidiaries. On the left side, you can see that EUR 447 million
will be devoted to pay to shareholders is the 2017 calendar year; another EUR 124 million
will be devoted to overheads and other payments at holding companies; and EUR 183
million will be allocated to improve our capital position and capital increases of lossmaking units. Principally, I'm talking about MAPFRE ASISTENCIA and also our subsidiary in
Italy, Direct Line Italy.
In conclusion -- I have to say as well that the -- a small amount, EUR 122 million, will be an
increase in debt in order to finance the recent acquisition of a small stake in ABDA.

Bloomberg Transcript

In conclusion, there is appropriate diversification of dividend contribution from the
different regions and units, with Spain, again, being the most important unit contributing
dividends.
It is also relevant to mention that dividends are coming from units holding the highest
Solvency II ratios, particularly I'm referring to the units in Spain: MAPFRE EspaÃ±a and
MAPFRE VIDA and also MAPFRE RE. I will also to remark that we have -- there's still a
dividend flexibility and also the capital fungibility between regions and units.
And last, I would like to discuss shareholders' dividends that were also mentioned by our
Chairman. The evolution over the last five years shows an overall stable trend in payout
and dividend growth. Regarding our 3-year strategic objective, our dividend payout target
range of 50% to 65% is still in place, no doubt. And with flexibility to reach the upper limit,
if necessary. And achieve the 5% dividend yield target.
As you know, net income this year has been impacted by the Third Quarter cat losses that
we have already mentioned. So in order to maintain the dividend this year, we have to
optimize our performance to achieve an extraordinary Fourth Quarter profit, which will
allow us to maintain our commitment of stable and growing shareholder remuneration.
In this context, we have to wait to see the year-end figures. And as the Chairman
mentioned, the final dividend against 2017 results will be announced in February 2018 and
approved at the AGM in March.
Thank you for your attention. And I hope you enjoy the rest of the presentation. And also
the Volvo Ocean Race video you're going to see in a minute.

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Natalia. Good morning, everyone. I will start the presentation with a very quick
update on the current situation of MAPFRE RE and then we will go into more detail not
only on our reinsurance program but on the whole cat risk management framework that
we have in place.
This is not much different to most of our colleagues and competitors. But for us, the
important thing is that your key takeaway after the presentation is that the approach and
handling of the risk for catastrophe events in MAPFRE is solid and measured.
Talking about the performance of MAPFRE RE in 2017, we have to say it's, again, an
excellent year for us, given the circumstances in which we are moving this year. The
growth in premium that has been very strong over the last years is still positive, with just
under 4% growth ratio in premiums. And in terms of results that have been excellent over
the last few years, we still are in a very positive position, although the results are smaller
than the previous years.
We have a decline of 21% on our attributable result to MAPFRE, mainly driven by the cat
events happening in 2017 and a reduction in our investment income due to some -- to the
low interest rates that persist. Excluding the cat events that we had in the Third Quarter of
2017. But not excluding those happened in the rest of the year, the profit of the year
would have been growing by 39%.
This confirms the tendency that we already advised previously of having a very good
underwriting result in the long run with -- in the period from 2005 to 2017, having an
average combined ratio of 95.4%, even considering that we had 2005, 2010, 2011 and
this 2017 with a very high cat frequency and intensity.

Page 10 of 44

FINAL

But the most important thing, in addition to having good combined ratio, is that the
volatility is significantly lower than the market average. As you can see, for example, in
2017, our combined ratio is 20 points better than the market average.
This has some reasons, of course, as we said already before, the first of all is the wish
and the requirement of our shareholders that want us to be less volatile than the market
average. And we achieved that by avoiding certain territories and certain types of risk that
we don't write. And actually, add those to a big extent that were affected most in the 2017
events. And also that we are a substantial buyer of reinsurance cover. That, of course,
reduces our income in the better years of the cycle. But in the years with big cat activity
has a positive impact on our results.
When we look at it from a return on equity point of view, as you can see, the returns have
been very positive over the years and especially in the years 2014, '15, '16. And even in
2017, we are well above 12% on the average on return on equity. Again, the most
important part for us in addition to that is the volatility is lower than the market average.

Bloomberg Transcript

The reason for having such a good return also has to do with the reduced volatility
because our capital requirement is also lower than some of our peers because of the
composition of our portfolio.
These good results have also helped us to being able to finance the growth of MAPFRE
RE over the last six years where we increased our equity by 56% or EUR 460 million,
without having to ask for any capital increase to our shareholders. But in addition to that,
we were able to pay dividends to our shareholders for EUR 500 million. And even in 2017,
we have been able and approved already distributing dividends of EUR 103 million to our
shareholders.
Turning now to our cat risk management framework for the MAPFRE Group, we will try to
give you a complete view of all the aspects of that. The first thing to answer is why it's
actually me who is sitting here and MAPFRE RE doing the presentation. And the reason for
that is that MAPFRE decided to delegate in MAPFRE RE this part of the risk management
of the group.
The reason for that is that we are a professional reinsurer present in 20 countries, having
business in more than 100 countries. But, most importantly, that we have a very extensive
experience in managing cat risk over our whole history. This has been -- always been a
core competence of MAPFRE RE. And the group is taking advantage of that.
MAPFRE reinsurance is the 100% reinsurer of all treaty reinsurance in the group as you
know. And in that role, we define the group reinsurance structures and retrocession
programs. We optimize the retentions for the group. We supervise credit risk for the
treaty and facultative for the group. And we also monitor and control the cat risk across
the group. We will try to give more details about that over the presentation.
Talking about our reinsurance policy, there is certain philosophical points that are very
important for us. First of all, that we separate, when we buy reinsurance, the protection of
Page 11 of 44



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2017-12-01

FINAL

-- the portfolio of our inwards reinsurance that we accept from nongroup companies from
those coming from the MAPFRE Group. The main reason for that is that we don't want to - that there is any chance that the MAPFRE Group companies can lose competitivity if we
suffer losses coming from nongroup companies.
Additionally, for us, it's very important that we keep a very long-term partnership with our
reinsurers. It's not only important that we get competitive pricing or that we are sure that
the credit risk is in order. But for us, it's important that we design reinsurance structures
that are sustainable and relationships that are sustainable with our partners.
It's important for us that not only that our reinsurance are able to respond in a stressed
situation. But also that they are able and willing to support us after a stress situation so
that we continue with our business normally and without much of a disruption.
Additionally, there's another important aspect of it. MAPFRE RE doesn't cause additional
costs to any MAPFRE company. We don't charge overriders or any other remuneration
policy for the work that we do for the group. Our remuneration comes from the retention
of additional risk that we take from the MAPFRE companies in the group.

As you know. And we will talk about later on, a big part of our protection from -- for the
cat risk comes from our Cat XL regional programs. But this is not the whole picture, it's
just a part of our whole protection framework and reinsurance framework.
Talking about, specifically, that XL protection, when we designed that structure newly for
2014, we had a number of objectives with the ultimate goal of making the cover more
efficient for MAPFRE et al. We decided to structure and place global programs for the
whole group that try to simplify the reinsurance structures. And the main approach was
designed to be on a territorial and not designed for -- to cover specific companies. We
tried to protect the exposures that we get from a given territory, not taking so much
interest in the protection of individual entities. But protecting the balance sheet of the
whole group and the P&L of the whole group.
When we talk about our risk management framework, as I said before, it's not just talking
about reinsurance, it's talking about the whole process that we have to accomplish with.
We have this thing, which here are 5 steps that are applicable for all MAPFRE companies
being insurance companies, GLOBAL RISKS and MAPFRE RE. That includes the exposure
accumulation control, the full risk modeling of our portfolio. After that, we will talk about
reinsurance design. When we place reinsurance, we need to make sure that the credit
and liquidity risk is also controlled. And finally and not the less important is to have in place
contingency plans and disaster recovery, first, to make sure that the safety of our teams
and collaborators is warranted and then that we are able to respond to the needs of our
clients immediately or as quickly as possible.
Talking specifically on the different points, we will start with the accumulation control. In
this process, what we actually do is aggregating all the insured values that we have in a
given territory that could potentially be exposed to cat events and trying to get that
information with the maximum granularity possible and the most detail about that cover

index and the characteristic of each risk that can have an influence on the ultimate loss
that the risk can suffer with an event. We do that both on a legal entity basis. And then we
consolidate all the information on a corporate level in MAPFRE RE. This information is the
basis for all the modeling that we do of our portfolios. We can't do any modeling without
having a very detailed control of these exposures.
Turning to the modeling. This is a very busy slide that I don't -- won't go into detail on all
the content, it's just for you to make sure that this is an extremely complex process that
we have to go through. That includes 20 legal entities that get involved into this, where
we model 177 territories. And that gives us a full view of the cat exposure and the cat risk
that we have in the group.

Bloomberg Transcript

It's again a 3-steps process. It's first -- the first one is actually the modeling of the
exposure that we have been aggregating in the first step of our model. And this is done
using commercially available models in the industry. And where they are not available, we
use what we call PML curves, which are internally developed curves to try to get
information about the portfolio. The outcome is that we get statistical loss distributions
that simulate the events that could happen in a given territory. These distributions that we
obtain through the modeling of the portfolio are transferred to, what we call, our DFA
model, dynamic financial analysis, where we put together, in addition to the loss
expectations that we have, we put it to work together with the different reinsurance
structures that we have in place and seeing how effective they are or not.
The final step is that what we get our outputs that we separate in 2 main areas, which are
probabilistic, where we attach to a certain loss scenario, different probabilities of
occurrence and we take the different views of the risk. And additionally, we obtain what
we call deterministic scenarios, which we will cover on later, that are mainly used for stress
testing our accounts and for the credit risk control.
Talking about one of the outputs of our probabilistic scenarios is the one that we see on
the next slide. One of the results that we can obtain is actually, the capital that MAPFRE
would require for the cat risk that we assume. And we can start with the one that we
would require if we wouldn't buy any reinsurance at all, which is an option that some of
companies in the world decide to do. But we also can analyze how much capital relief we
get by buying different types of reinsurance. In this slide, we do a simulation of our whole
capital requirement for insurance portfolios of MAPFRE. So the MAPFRE insurance
portfolio in the different countries, plus MAPFRE GLOBAL RISK. And we see that through
facultative placements, we are reducing our capital needs by 29% currently by ceding to
reinsurance, which is -- that are different to our global CapEx program. We reduce another
30% of our capital requirement. And finally, our MAPFRE Group XL protection reduces our
capital requirement by 20%. So all together, we can now estimate what our gross capital
requirement is and our net capital requirement for the cat risk.
In addition to that, what we have to model is if the cost of that capital relief that we get,
which effectively is a substitute of other types of capital, is effective or not. And this is the
information that we try to obtain and we show on this next slide.

FINAL

We have here an estimation of the capital relief that we get from our regional Cat XL
cover, what we call, the ceded capital is actually the reduction of capital that we obtain
from our reinsurance program. Then we can estimate if the price that we are paying for
that capital that we get from our reinsurers is effective or not.
First thing that you could do is just deduct the premium that we pay from the amount of
capital reduction that we get. And that would mean that, that capital cost us 11.7%. That is
not the real economic calculation that you should do, because we expect to get
recoveries from that over the years and in the long term. So if we deduct what we expect
to recover. And this is again a modeling output, we expect to recover 9.3% of the -- from
losses. So what we expect as a margin from -- for our reinsurance is 2.4% of the capital
relief that we obtain. And if we estimate that pretax -- after tax, sorry, it's 1.8%.
Just as we are as well a professional reinsurer, just to mention that these economics are
not exactly the same for a reinsurance. For them, when they enter this risk into their
portfolio and for diversification reasons, probably their margin that they obtain is
significantly higher because the additional capital requirement that they get from this
acceptance is lower than the one that we -- than the relief that we get. And that's the
beauty of reinsurance in the market.

Bloomberg Transcript

This is, of course, a key consideration, when we decide what reinsurance we buy or not, is
the cost and how effective it is compared to other sources of capital. But it's not the only
one, of course. There are additional consideration that we need to take in place, like a
volatility management of our accounts, the actual available capital in MAPFRE that we can
put in danger. And of course, the risk appetite that we have as a company.
Another output, as we said before, that we get from the modeling are deterministic
scenarios. And just for you to understand what we mean by that it's just the simulation of
specific events happening during one year. In this example, for example, we would
simulate what would happen to our accounts if we had in one given year a large
windstorm in Europe that would mostly affect MAPFRE RE, a large earthquake event in
Chile that would affect MAPFRE RE, MAPFRE Chile and MAPFRE GLOBAL RISK. So it would
be a very significant event for MAPFRE and, at the same -- in the same year, that we
would have another event like a large hurricane affecting the northeast of the U.S.A.
When we -- we can introduce the simulation in the model and we would get a complete
detail of what would be -- what our gross loss could be in -- for this -- in that year for cat
events and the amount of reinsurance recoverables that we would get from all the
reinsurance treaties that we have in the portfolio, let it be on a per-event basis and also
for the reinsurance protection that we get for frequency. And we would -- and that having
what our net loss -- net figures would be.
Let's move on now to our reinsurance this time. This slide was already presented in the
Third Quarter results presentation. And it shows how our reinsurance structure is done.
This is only applicable to our group insurance operations. So MAPFRE Insurance in the
different countries and MAPFRE GLOBAL RISK. And it's not how we protect our
reinsurance portfolio for Non-Group business.

As we said at that time, we have -- for every MAPFRE entity, legal entity, they have their
own reinsurance program protecting their balance sheet and that company. And they
would normally buy or -- and XL proportional or a -- and XL protection or a proportional
protection in facultative. As per our reinsurance policy, 100% of the treaty business, let it
be proportional or not proportional, is accepted by MAPFRE RE and the part of the
facultative business. Of that business that is coming to MAPFRE RE, we may see it most of
the times proportionately part of that risk through a specific placement and retain another
part of it.
When we talk about the Cat XL protections of MAPFRE, what we are protecting by that -those protections is the aggregation of the retentions of the different legal entities,
including MAPFRE RE after all other reinsurances that are placed before that.
Once we have decided how we want to operate, we need to decide how much limit of
cover that we want to buy. And that is what we try to explain on the next slide. Again, after
the modeling, we obtain what size of events we can obtain -- suffer from given events
and for the different perils that we are exposed to in the territories and the probability of
that.

Bloomberg Transcript

On that graph, you will see that we say that for a 100-years return period or a 250-years
return period, we will suffer certain type of losses. That means, in the case of a 100-year
return period, that we have a chance of 1 every 100 years of having a loss that exceeds a
certain amount or, in the case of the one in 250-years return period, is that that we have a
0.4 probability each year of exceeding a certain amount.
When we look at those outputs on the different territories, we come to the loss
expectations and the probabilities. And based on that information, we decide how much
limit we want to buy in reinsurance cover. But we don't -- and we don't look just on
individual countries. But also on the combination of different countries that could be
affected on different events. So you have the different countries protected under what we
call our NARC program that we will explain later on. But also, what is the combined
expected loss for losses affecting the whole of the Caribbean or the whole territory
covered on this. So effectively, that we have a loss affecting the U.S.A. and the Caribbean
at the same time.
As you see there, we dry -- we draw the line on the limits that we are buying, where you
can see that we are buying protection for each individual territory for covering losses that
can happen once every 250 years. And we only have the possibility of exceeding that for
certain very specific events that affect both the U.S.A. and the Caribbean or that are
extremely big events in one of the given territories.
Now we will disclose, for the first time, what our actual reinsurance structure is for -- again,
for the non -- for the group business, the group insurance business. So covering business
generated by the MAPFRE insurance companies and MAPFRE GLOBAL RISK. But not the
Non-Group business of MAPFRE RE.

Page 15 of 44

FINAL

As we said before, we have 3 towers or pillars, as we call them, of cover. The one is
called NARC, which protects the territories that could be affected by hurricanes in the
Atlantic. It's called North American -- North Atlantic regional cover. For those territories, we
keep a retention on each event of USD 100 million. And we buy a protection of USD 900
million for losses that exceed this USD 100 million threshold of USD 300 million.
We have another tower that is called MERC; that mainly covers Latin America and Turkey.
And the main peril is earthquake, although it covers also for our perils. Again, for those
events affecting that portfolio, we take a USD 100 million retention. And in this case, we
buy USD 1 billion of cover in addition. So we are covered for losses up to USD 1.1 billion.
And in addition to that, we have a third pillar or tower that we call CIRC, which is a smaller
one that has 2 main areas where it works. First of all, it protects for exposures that we
have in territories where MAPFRE GLOBAL RISK operates and there is no MAPFRE
company. And additionally, it works as, what we call, as a sublayer for what we call smaller
territories for MAPFRE, where we want to reduce something our retention.
In addition to that, we have, what we call, an umbrella cover. That gives us additional $300
million of limit. And it's used in case that any of the different towers is exhausted by one
event, we get an additional $300 million of cover.

Bloomberg Transcript

And finally, we have what we call a frequency cover that reduces our retention in case that
we have more than one event in any given year. So for the first event under -- that affects
the NARC or the MERC tower, we would take USD 100 million retention. But for the events
happening afterwards, our retention is reduced to USD 75 million.
Now how did this structure work with Maria, which is the only one that really has a big
influence on that? In Maria, we had 3 portfolios that were affected. The most important
ones were MAPFRE Puerto Rico portfolio and MAPFRE GLOBAL RISK. And additionally, a
small exposure to MAPFRE Dominican Republic. Additionally and separate, we have some
exposures coming from Non-Group companies under the MAPFRE RE portfolio.
Our current best estimate for the gross loss for MAPFRE Puerto Rico is USD 500 million -sorry, EUR 500 million. We have converted everything to euros from this point onwards.
Of that EUR 500 million of gross loss, MAPFRE Puerto Rico retains EUR 30 million
themselves. And they cede the rest to the reinsurance covers, EUR 415 million to their
own Cat XL program. That is ceded completely to MAPFRE RE and another EUR 55 million
to another treaty that they have on their commercial portfolio that -- where MAPFRE RE
doesn't retain risk. Therefore, what we call, the protected retention under the group Cat
XL is EUR 455 million made of the local retention of MAPFRE Puerto Rico and the amounts
ceded and retained by MAPFRE RE.
MAPFRE GLOBAL RISK has -- the best estimate that we have currently is a EUR 381 million
gross loss, of which they cede, on a facultative basis, EUR 146 million to other treaties that
they have that are not there, Cat XL EUR 53 million and to their Cat XL, EUR 159 million.
And their net retention is EUR 23 million. Again, the contribution to the protected

Page 16 of 44



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2017-12-01

retention under our Cat XL is EUR 192 million made of the retention that MAPFRE GLOBAL
RISK takes themselves, plus the one that is retained by MAPFRE RE.

FINAL

Finally, MAPFRE Dominicana takes -- contributes with another EUR 0.8 million to the
protected retention. So adding up all these figures, the amount that will be ceded to the
Cat XL of the group is EUR 639 million. Of that amount, the retention of MAPFRE is USD
100 million, which equals to EUR 85 million.
When we see how we distribute then the loss between the different entities, we said
before that MAPFRE Puerto Rico is retained EUR 30 million; Dominican Republic has EUR 1
million, EUR 0.8 million; and MAPFRE GLOBAL RISK retains EUR 23 million. So the MAPFRE
insurance entities are retaining EUR 53 million. And the difference up to the external
reinsurance program of MAPFRE, this USD 100 million that are EUR 85 million, is retained
by MAPFRE RE, in this case, is EUR 31 million.
Additionally, we have another retention, which is what we get from the reinsurance
portfolio that we accept to Non-Group companies, making EUR 114 million net retention to
MAPFRE before the frequency covers that we will talk about later. I don't know if this is
complicated or not. But what I can tell you that it's effective and efficient for sure for
MAPFRE.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let's talk now about what we -- our estimates of loss into MAPFRE on a net basis after tax
and after minority interests, which are, for the time being, unchanged compared to the
ones that we released already with the Third Quarter results.
On the next slide, what we do is we will -- we do present what our gross loss is and how
it's ceded to the different protections. The gross loss that we are currently estimating,
again, it's our best estimate and it can fluctuate, is EUR 1.15 billion of a gross loss coming
from the 5 events that we suffered in the Third Quarter. We have EUR 152 million
recoveries from facultative; from non-Cat XL treaty, EUR 150 million; and, as we said
before, EUR 574 million recovered from our Cat XL. Additionally, we are able to recover
EUR 24 million from the frequency cover that we mentioned before that protects MAPFRE
for having more than one event affecting us in a given year.
So finally, on -- as a wrap-up on Maria. Maria was the biggest hurricane in Puerto Rico, in
over 100 years. The good thing about it is that it didn't take a special price. What
happened or the outcome of the loss in terms of economic values, it was within our
expectations.
When we talk about the MAPFRE Puerto Rico portfolio, we are using still a very
conservative loss estimate. And everything is within our expectations and within our group
protections. It has to be highlighted that the MAPFRE Puerto Rico portfolio is of an
extremely high quality. And that the market intelligence that we -- and the local knowledge
that we gained over many years in Puerto Rico, has proven to be very effective in keeping
the loss within acceptable levels.

FINAL

On the MAPFRE GLOBAL RISK, again, we didn't have any surprise. And the degree of
facultative sessions that we bought and the limitations in terms of limits, again, prevent us
for having strong deviations.
And talking about the MAPFRE RE portfolio, the impact is very moderate, specifically,
because we decided not to take much risk in the Caribbean, precisely, because other
MAPFRE companies were very exposed to that territory. And it is a very volatile area and a
highly exposed area.
Finally, one additional step on our risk management framework, is the control of our credit
risk. It's not only about ceding risk. But also being sure that we are able to recover those.
We have to say that the quality of our reinsurance panel is excellent across the whole
chain of reinsurance covers that we have. As you can say, we have 56% of the EUR 900
million recoveries that we have is placed with carriers that are AA; or higher. And 100% of
our recovers are with reinsurance that are over and in the A level rating.
We have to say, in addition, that we are -- have obtained a great response from our
reinsurers; they have been paying claims very speedily. And we have, at the current time,
no liquidity issues and no problems on recovering the claims from the reinsurance market.

Bloomberg Transcript

Finally, the last step of our -- but definitely, not the least important, is the contingency
planning and the disaster recoveries that we suffered. We have to say that those
contingency plans have worked very well in all territories that were affected by CAT
events in the year. We have been able to provide services to our clients and the
community at all time. And it works -- it has been working extremely well.
Additionally, we -- MAPFRE has taken steps to help our employees, their families and their
communities to overcome the situation that they have been suffering in the country,
especially in Puerto Rico, the situation of the country has been extremely difficult. And is
still extremely difficult to our employees and their families. And MAPFRE has taken steps
to help them to overcome the situation.
So finally, as a few key takeaways from this. We have to say that 2017 has been a great
test for us, improving the effectiveness of our cat risk management program. Everything
has worked well and according to our plans.
These impacts will have an impact on our earnings, that's clear. But will not affect our
capital and will not cause any big stress for us. The group cat reinsurance program has
proven to be effective, has worked as planned. And we are satisfied with what we have in
place.
Thank you very much. And now I'm very glad to answer questions.

If I may, Natalia, I would like to say a couple of words regarding Eduardo's presentation.
First of all, thank you, Eduardo. We've seen a quite comprehensive presentation. It was
almost, I mean, the MAPFRE RE presentation is like a MAPFRE RE Investor Day for you. We
really thank you.
And second, I mean, just to reaffirm the importance of MAPFRE RE in the group. MAPFRE
RE is an integral part of the group. MAPFRE RE, in the strategic approach, with our
subsidiaries that operate in Latin America, especially in territories with recent natural cat
exposure, subsidiaries, primary insurance and MAPFRE RE, they're birds of the same
feather. And we flock together, for sure.

Bloomberg Transcript

Also too, thanks, Eduardo, for the new disclosure. As he said, that this is the first time that
MAPFRE RE is opening its doors and giving to investors analysis -- and analysts a, let's say,
quite commercial sensitivity, information. This is part of the transparency plan that MAPFRE
started last year in order to give you -- to give to the markets more information in order
to have a better knowledge of MAPFRE. Some of the information and the details given,
they were asked at our -- the financial conference that we attended in New York and also
in London. At that time, it wasn't possible, I mean, just to provide you with this information,
it wasn't the right time. And we want to thank you for your patience. And also, we've
reaffirmed what we said at this conference. I mean, we were -- we know very well the risks
which we (ride) in and our feeling at that point was that our loss expectation was quite far
from the external parties' assessment that were made at that point.
And finally, I mean, the way that MAPFRE is handling natural cat losses go beyond the
figures, numbers, coverage, retentions, number of claims and so on. For MAPFRE, I mean,
behind a cat loss like this, like Maria, there are always people, their personal situation is
extremely difficult, there are damages and also fatalities. And this is the social size of a
group as MAPFRE. We will be always providing support, first to our policyholders, to our
agents, to our employees, families and so on.
As you know, our Chairman visited Puerto Rico, after the cat losses. And he worked for
Puerto Rico. I was with him as well. And also Jaime Tamayo. And also more executives, we
were there. And I'm sure they could give you later on more details regarding the way
MAPFRE socially handle a natural cat like -- loss like Maria.
So there's nothing else from my side. So if we're ready, I think we can go through...

Questions And Answers
A - Natalia NÃºÃ±ez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

We can start with the Q&A. Thank you very much for this interesting presentation and also
the remarks, the wrap-up made by Fernando. The first question comes from Francisco
Riquel from Alantra Equities. He wants to know, apart from RE, GLOBAL RISK is another
area where you are having large and frequent claims this year. What change in risk taking
and protection policies are you adopting in this area, if any?

FINAL

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Well MAPFRE GLOBAL RISKS, it's true that they have -- they are a global company and
have exposures on a global basis. They have their own reinsurance program. And we
keep analyzing if we can improve their protection locally. As I said before, our main goal is
to protect the balance sheet of MAPFRE as a whole. And that the losses that we keep
within MAPFRE in -- of the global portfolios of -- including GLOBAL RISKS, MAPFRE RE and
MAPFRE Insurance, are covered sufficiently. It's -- sometimes, it's not that important if
there is one entity that suffers a little bit more than the other. What we really try to
achieve is that the ultimate retention of MAPFRE RE -- of MAPFRE as a group is sufficiently
measured. GLOBAL RISK operates in a business that by itself is volatile. And we have to
be aware that there will be years. And this is a very special year, because they had the
concentration of losses that is absolutely unusual, where they suffer a little bit more than
others. But they are suffering in line with peers and with other competitors operating in
that business. But for us, what the important thing is that it doesn't generate instability in
MAPFRE outside of certain boundaries.

A - Natalia NÃºÃ±ez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. Really clear. Thank you. Next one it also comes from Francisco Riquel.
And he would like to know what additional NatCat coverage do we have still in place? In
other words, how would another catastrophe before year-end affect our guidance for
NatCat losses, the guidance that we gave between EUR 150 million and EUR 200 million?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Well it very much will depend on where it happens and what kind of portfolios are
affected. But what we can see from the presentation is if for the insurance portfolio, being
MAPFRE GLOBAL RISK or MAPFRE Insurance companies, we see that additional losses
would affect in -- with a figure of USD 25 million, which is where our frequency coverers
would start to play. And the only bigger uncertainty would be if the cat events happened
in territories where MAPFRE RE operates and not other MAPFRE Group companies, where
we would have to suffer bigger losses. We have more than sufficient protection in place
available. And in any case, as we have already a number of cat losses during the year, the
additional retentions that we get -- that we would have would get smaller for every loss
that comes after, as a one that we had a decreasing trend.

A - Natalia NÃºÃ±ez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. So much. This one also comes from Francisco Riquel, Michael Huttner
from JP Morgan and Niccolo Dalla-Palma from Exane BNP Paribas. And the question is,
what changes in reinsurance raises are you observing in terms of renewals? What is the
reinsurance strategy in 2018? Would you buy more or less cover? And what's the potential
rise in the cost in 2018?

A - Eduardo Perez de Lema

{BIO 20385404 <GO>}

Well for the changes in reinsurance prices, as you know, we are now in the midst of the
renewals of year-end. There is very clearly a pressure from the reinsurance market to
increase the pricing. And of course, there is a resistance from the reinsurance buyer to
increase those costs, which is part of the negotiations. And to get the full picture, it's still
Page 20 of 44



FINAL

Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2017-12-01

very early days. We don't foresee a massive price increase in nonaffected territories. We
think it is healthy for the market, both for the buyers and for the sellers of reinsurance, to
increase the pricing overall, because we have been suffering for a prolonged soft market.
But to have the exact figure of what the outcome will be, is still early. It's absolutely sure
that the prices won't fall during this renewal. And definitely, we expect some price rises.
But we can't tell a figure right now, because it's still very early days. Talking about the
reinsurance structure for 2018, we are very comfortable with our reinsurance structure and
strategy. As you could see from the presentation, we have plenty of cover available to
cover losses that are even bigger than those that we suffered in 2017. So we are
comfortable with the structure. And at this point in time, we don't expect any change. But
it will depend on how the market evolves from here to our time of renewals, which for the
insurance portfolio of MAPFRE, the program that we have shown in this presentation, is
due to renew in July. Again, it's very early to say how much the prices will rise. But we have
a very good news and a big advantage this year that (now, yes) it could be different. But
the events happened in the Third Quarter of 2017. And we are renewing in July 2018. And
specifically, in the territories affected, we are already starting to increase the insurance
pricing. So we will get income to pay for any potential increase in cost. Then we will try to
buy as effective and competitive as we can and that's the only thing that we can say right
now because it's still a long way to go until we have the renewals coming.

Okay. Also regarding MAPFRE RE, Ivan Bokhmat from Barclays want to know if there is a
cat budget for the year for MAPFRE RE in terms of co-migration and how has it evolved
over time? How do you see it change in the future? Sorry, the budget for combined ratio.

A - Eduardo Perez de Lema

{BIO 20385404 <GO>}

Combined ratio. We have an estimation of what we can expect of having of cat losses in
MAPFRE RE. We are not disclosing that figure right now. But we have a budget. And what
we suffered so far in 2018 -- '17, sorry, is within the budget and the normal trend that we
had, very especially, because we were lucky this time that the cat events for the MAPFRE
RE portfolio, not for the whole MAPFRE. But for the MAPFRE RE portfolio occurred in
places and types of risk where we are less exposed than the market average. So we were
able to keep the loss experience within the cat budgets that we have for 2017.

A - Natalia NÃºÃ±ez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Thank you. So much, because this one came just in the last minute. And we are trying to
answer all of them. There is another one from Ivan Bokhmat. He wanted to know what do
you expect in terms of cost of reinsurance for primary companies.

A - Eduardo Perez de Lema

{BIO 20385404 <GO>}

Well as I said before, we definitely hope. And we think it will be healthy, that we see a
price increase. But we don't have the answer yet. And I think we -- as an industry, we are
all pressing to try to increase something in the pricing and -- but I can't give you the figure,
because there are too many market players influencing the situation. Unfortunately, it's
not just on us, it's on the whole market to decide.

If I may add something. And let's say, that for internal reinsurance, majority of the MAPFRE
subsidiaries, they know very well that the moment of -- we live in. And they're well
prepared in order to -- their profit and loss account for next year in order to handle, I
mean, this potential rise and also to transfer to policyholders. I mean, we operate in
markets like Puerto Rico with -- there is up and downs. And there is always an upside
market after a catastrophe. And MAPFRE subsidiary and other subsidiaries, they are quite
prone, I mean, to set the right price.

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. And this is the last one of this block of questions. Anyway, as we have
mentioned before, at the end of the event, we will have all the participants here. And if
there is any question that comes in the late minutes and it's worth mentioning, we will. So
the last one, from Andrew Sinclair, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, is a bigger one. And he
wants to know if you can confirm how much of your anticipated recoveries from your
reinsurance has now been received from September storms.

A - Eduardo Perez de Lema

{BIO 20385404 <GO>}

Well it's not a public information. But it's not a big figure yet, the -- especially where we
get the recoveries, which is in Puerto Rico, it's still early days. It will be a claim that will take
time to be fully settled. We have received some recoveries from our reinsurers. And they
have been responding extremely well. But the full payout of the loss will take, for the bulk
of it, at least a year to be fully paid, because there is a substantial part of the recoveries
that will be made under business interruption policies where we will see the amount of
gross loss later in the year and then at the beginning of next year.

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

We have cash closes in...

A - Eduardo Perez de Lema

{BIO 20385404 <GO>}

Yes, yes. We have already asked for cash recoveries and advanced payments that cover
our liquidity needs until the end of the year. And I have to say that our colleagues and
partners, the reinsurance partners have been paying extremely quickly and almost
competing to be the quickest in paying. So it's a -- it's very pleasing. And I think it's a very
good news to the industry that, as an industry, we are able to cope with a year like this
without any disruption and paying our obligations very quickly.

Hello. Welcome back. And now, please welcome Jaime Tamayo, CEO of International
business, that will give us a great insight about the international operations. After his
presentation, Alfredo Castelo, CEO of North America region, we will talk more in depth
about our North American operations.
Thank you very much. Good morning.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jaime Tamayo IbÃ¡Ã±ez
Morning. And thank you, Natalia. And good morning, ladies and gentlemen. It is a pleasure
for me to share with all of you the information related to the MAPFRE's international
operations, its Third Quarter performance as well as the fundamentals of the restructure
actions that we are taking in order to better optimize our results. After my intervention,
Alfredo Castelo, my colleague, Alfredo, CEO of MAPFRE North America, will dive into the
details of our U.S. operations and its restructuring plan, which are a key component of our
renewed international strategy.
Let me start by outlining the composition of our international operations. We are currently
structured in 3 regions: North America, EMEA and APAC, Asia Pacific. As you can see,
diversity is the key feature of our area: geographic, demographic, linguistic, cultural as
well as diversity related to the economic development of the markets in which we
operate and their degree of maturity.
In this slide, let me show you the levels of growth and performance in terms of top line
that we're seeing now in our international operations.
At the closing of the Third Quarter, international shows a 2% decrease in premiums versus
2016, mainly related to the performance in 2 markets. Turkey, with a 19% decrease, which
reflects the steep depreciation of the Turkish lira in the current year, combined with the
profitability measures that we had to take after the government decree of April 2017,
which, as you may know, imposed a mandatory decrease in Auto third-party liability
premiums, or the so-called MTPL business. This decrease was estimated by our teams in
Turkey at an average of 30%.

FINAL

And second, the second market which is dragging down our top line performance, is
Puerto Rico, with an 8% decrease, mainly related to the economic situation in the island, in
recession since 2006, which has caused an endemic slowdown in economic activity.
Regarding the U.S., we saw a very strong growth of 4.9% in our core market of
Massachusetts, which is the largest market in which we operate in the U.S.. And this
growth somehow is offset by the designed voluntary decreases in volumes in some
states outside Massachusetts related to the decisive actions that we are taking in regards
to going back or turning back into profitability. On the very positive side of things, we see
very healthy growth patterns in our European markets, highlighting Germany, Italy and
Malta.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let me walk you through what we consider our major achievements in the key markets in
which we operate. The U.S. Excellent results in Massachusetts, as I mentioned before,
4.9% premium growth, with a strong performance on the technical side, showing a 96.3%
combined ratio. As well, in the last month, we proceeded with a soft launch of our VERTI
U.S.A. operation in the state of Pennsylvania. VERTI, as you all know, is the new automobile
digital operation that we put together in the U.S. in order to attack the fastest-growing
distribution segment of the digital -- in the digital arena.
In Germany, successful new branding of Verti Germany. As you know, when we acquired
their Direct Line operations back in 2015, we also committed to the change of that brand
into VERTI. So in that sense, we proceeded with the change by the end of this first half of
the current year. And the change has been a total success, where we are not seeing any
movement whatsoever in our retention levels of our business in Germany. Business
diversification as well on the Life side in Germany and -- which is something that we were
pursuing in order to balance our portfolio, which is mainly composed by Auto business.
In Italy, Direct Line Italy restructuring is delivering tangible benefits. I'd like to highlight the
fact that our net result is up by 71% versus last year.
Malta continues its sustained value-creation, thanks to the leadership in both Life and NonLife. And as well the partnership that we enjoy with the largest bank in the island, Bank of
Valletta. And -- which is proving to be a very, very successful venture with them. As well, let
me highlight in our Maltese operation, our return to profitability on the Non-Life side of
the business.
Turkey. Turkey's result is up by 120% in local currency and almost 80% in euros in '16. Major
turnaround of our operations in Turkey, Turkey is having an excellent year in 2017.
And finally, I'd like to highlight the successful takeover of a 62.3% stake in the Indonesian
insurance company, ABDA, which makes our -- marks our formal entry into the Indonesian
market.
Being the latest acquisition of MAPFRE, let me give you a brief snapshot of our newest
acquisition, ABDA. A country, Indonesia, with more than 260 million people, with a median
age of less than 30 years. As you can see in the table that you have in front of you, the
Page 24 of 44



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2017-12-01

company presents an excellent technical profitability, with a combined ratio of 94.1% at the
closing of the Third Quarter and with a net result of EUR 8.7 million. We are -- we have
great expectations about our long-term future and performance in the Indonesian market.

FINAL

Let me show you briefly where the international operations of MAPFRE are located with
the -- our current organizational structure, showing it's the current 3 regions that form
international: North America, EMEA and APAC, Asia Pacific.
There is no question of the importance of our U.S. operations within our International
business. As such, we have decided to proceed with EMEA restructure action in order to
totally focus on profitability outside Massachusetts.
Our actions, which will be explained in detail later by Alfredo Castelo, will focus in 3 main
pillars. First, reduce geographical footprint with -- representing the exit from 5 states:
New York, New Jersey, Indiana, Tennessee and Kentucky. We will become a more
customer-centric organization. And we will have a total focus on our core business,
personal lines, both automobile and home. All these with the actions that were -- which
are corporate actions as well, which is -- are in place in order to strive our operations
towards digital transformation.

Bloomberg Transcript

We strongly believe that these actions will better aid us navigate the U.S. market, a market
that is showing, as we all know, some challenging signs, such as 10 years of lack of
technical profitability in Private Auto. 2016 combined ratio has been reported for the
industry at 106% and is expected to present similar levels of nontechnical profitability in
'17.
Fastest growth in a decade in Miles Driven, which is something related to the much
improved economy in the United States. 2015, '17, a dramatic increase in loss costs. Why?
We're seeing a major factor coming from Distracted Driving, now a major element of
concern in the U.S. market. Weather is still playing a role. And we have a new key issue in
the U.S. market, which is the so-called Marihuana States, now a reality of concern.
Let me now proceed to walk you through the second major change that we're
implementing in our International operations: the integration into one single region called
Eurasia of the current EMEA and APAC regions. We believe that our strategies in EMEA,
mainly Europe and Asia, have 2 different speeds. As such, we must improve over
dimension adequacy as well as increase the capacity of our resources, especially in Asia.
APAC integration into EMEA creating Eurasia will be effective the 1st of January, 2018, in a
month from now, give or take. Our current heads of operations, technology and
processes, finance and business and clients will continue to be based in Asia to preserve
our expertise and knowhow in the Asian markets and to keep monitoring the operations
in the area locally. We're building a new strategic plan for ROAD CHINA ASSISTANCE as a
platform of innovation and development of the operation in China. We strongly believe
that the new Eurasia will give us a stronger platform to serve our current geographies of
operation.

FINAL

Here, in this slide, you can see the difference in size of the 2 regions being integrated,
which we believe is self-explanatory for its consolidation. The consolidated Eurasia region
would have had, at the end of the Third Quarter 2016, premiums of EUR 1.446 billion.
Let me now highlight and walk you through the -- our key performance indicators for the
EMEA region and its key markets, essentially European markets. Total premium show a
decrease of 4.1% for the region, mainly related to Turkey; the impact of the 19%
depreciation of the Turkish lira, which I mentioned before; and as well, the previously
explained profitability actions that we had to take after the decree from Ankara, which
mandated the decrease in automobile premiums, which were -- these actions were
essentially related to the elimination or cancellation of production sources of this
business, which we understand will -- is becoming nonprofitable at this point.
You can see the rest of the countries showing very healthy growth rates: Italy, 2.1%;
Germany, 7.5%; Malta, 12.8%. Worth noting that the growth in Italy has been achieved in
spite of the important restructure process performed and which was announced in our -in last year's Investor Day as well. In regards to Germany, our growth levels, which amount
to 7.5%, have been achieved taking into consideration the brand change that was affected
during the second and Third Quarter of this year, now operating as VERTI.

Bloomberg Transcript

In regards to net results or attributable results for the EMEA region, EMEA is showing a
major turnaround versus '16, with EUR 31.3 million in net results versus a loss of EUR 14
million in the prior year. And a steep improvement in technical profitability, with a
combined ratio of 100.7% versus the 106% of the prior year.
Again, it's worth highlighting the Turkish results, with an outstanding performance so far in
'17, showing EUR 39.2 million in net results and an excellent combined ratio of 96.5%.
Germany, excellent combined ratio as well, 99%, within technical levels of profitability
after the investment that we had to allocate in order to produce the rebranding process,
with no impact whatsoever in the operations and also in spite of the worst hail season in
years, which affected, obviously, the losses and the frequency on our automobile
business.
Finally, Malta, showing as well an outstanding 96.5% combined ratio, much improved from
the 106.6% registered in the prior year.
Yet, some challenges still remain. MTPL regulation -- automobile regulation in Turkey has
materially changed the rules of the game. And the negative effects will become more
evident in the upcoming year. Turkish lira will likely continue to be volatile. Direct Line Italy
needs to finalize its turnaround and enter the value-creation mode. And in Germany,
continued growth has to keep materializing in increasing ROEs.
By country, the main highlights are the following. Turkey. MAPFRE SIGORTA has adapted
quickly to the new market context in its country and remains one of the most profitable
companies in its top 4 peer group. Our continuous focus on technical profitability; our
client-oriented and channel diversification strategies; the increasing cross-selling into
Page 26 of 44

FINAL

higher-profitable segments; and the sustained investment that we are producing in
technology is proving to be a very effective strategy in this country. We are very much
satisfied with the performance of our Turkish operations.
Italy. Italy has almost completed its restructuring and is now fully focused on building itself
into a profitable digital leader. We have new management in place, new CEO, new CFO,
new Direct Digital Director. We have a more efficient cost structure. And the results are
tangible. Losses have been cut by EUR 28.4 million versus the prior year. And our
combined ratio has decreased to 114%, which is still negative. But is very much improved
from the 129% that we were showing at the same period of last year. We believe that Italy
is on the right path to recovery. And the 2017 results show it clearly.

Bloomberg Transcript

Germany. Our model in Germany has been put to test and shows remarkable strength.
We had to rebrand the operation. And rebranding the operation is not an easy thing to
do. We -- the company was operating under the Direct Line brand before. We changed it
to -- and rebranded it to VERTI. And our levels of retention and patterns of new business
have not suffered materially. The 99% combined ratio shows well the focus on technical
management of the company. As I mentioned before, this is all in spite of the worst hail
season that the company has suffered in years.
Finally, Malta. MAPFRE MIDDLESEA's decisive actions on the motor business and
successful partnership with Bank of Valletta continue driving successful value creation.
We're back into profitability on the Non-Life side, which was a major goal for us in '17. And
our total combined ratio for all operations, Life and Non-Life, stands at 96.5%, which is a
decrease of 10.1 points versus last year. So tremendous improvement also in our Maltese
operations. On the Life side of things, the total assets under management at the end of
the Third Quarter of '17 stands at more than EUR 1.8 billion, which is up 11.4% from prior
year. We enjoy very healthy market shares in both Life and Non-Life in Malta: 77% Life;
34% in Non-Life.
In a nutshell. And I'm finalizing right now, we believe we are invested in EMEA in a region
with growth -- very good growth opportunities. The projected GDP forecasts are as you
can see on the table in front of you and make us believe that our expectations are
relevant and positive.
Now let me turn the word to Alfredo Castelo, Chief Executive Officer of our North
America region, who will explain you in detail the basis of our U.S. operations restructure.
Thank you very much.

A - Alf redo Castelo MarÃ­n
Thank you, Jaime. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to be presenting MAPFRE's
restructuring in the U.S.
As you will see in my presentation, we are simplifying our operation in the U.S. to make
sure that we are able to deliver profitable growth outside Massachusetts.

FINAL

As Jaime has mentioned, this restructuring has 3 main levers. A geographical footprint. As
has been already announced, we are going to be exiting 5 states. We are also going to
reduce the number of regions from 5 to 4. And we are going to give more emphasis to
the Northeast region with the appointment of a CEO for that specific region.
The second lever. And this is a very important one, is to focus in our core business. We're
going to want to focus in Auto and Homeowner business. As you may know, MAPFRE USA
also offers commercial lines, auto and small policies. But we are going to focus the
strategy for commercial lines in only 3 states: Massachusetts, California and Florida. And
it's very important to mention that digital business is something that is of strategic
importance for the group and for MAPFRE USA. And this is the reason why we have
launched VERTI in the U.S.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our third lever is to have a more customer-centric organization. Digital transformation is
going to be critical in our strategic plan. In that sense, we have created a digital
transformation office. And also, we have created 2 very important areas, business clients
(sic) (business & clients) and business support, to make sure that we are able to run an
efficient operation that is providing first-quality service to our customers. And as said
before, because of being more focused on the customer and recognizing the importance
of operations in the Northeast, we are appointing a CEO for that region.
Before I explain the restructuring, I think it's worth sharing with you how we see the
market and also our operations, our profitability initiatives in the U.S. We have to
acknowledge that the market context is challenging for personal line carriers. We are
seeing higher frequency and severity in Auto business. We are seeing many weatherrelated claims and wildfires in California. And as Jaime mentioned, the combined ratio for
the market is at 106%.
While this is happening in the market, in MAPFRE Insurance, we have been very much
focused in improving our profitability through a number of initiatives. I'm going to be
referring to the most important ones, the first being rate filings. We have taken rates in 36
-- 36 times in Auto business and 97 (sic) (17) in Homeowners, this in the first nine months
of 2017. It's important to mention that we have enhanced our pricing system outside
Massachusetts. We are also strengthening our underwriting and claims guidelines. I also
want to mention that we have working -- been able to have the systems to validate all
technical matters to minimize premium leakage. It's worth mention that we have also
spent lot of time in looking at the improvements of our agency management. Actually, as
you can see on the screen, we have cancelled more than 300 agency contracts because
of poor performance.
In order to improve the quality of our new business, we have also -- we are introducing
comparative rater strategies. And this is to minimize adverse selection. Also on the claim
side, we are trying to reduce our loss expenses through automation of processes and
also the increase of the use of our preferred repair shops.
And the last strategy, the last profitability strategy refers to strengthening our technical
areas. We have a new Chief Actuarial Officer and a new Chief Technical Officer. These 2

Page 28 of 44



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2017-12-01

people, together with their teams, are going to be leading and making sure that these
profitability initiatives are implemented in 2017.

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

I also want to provide you with some information about our performance in the U.S. as of
September. And I would like to start by sharing with you the information of our
Massachusetts operation, the operation in the state of Massachusetts.
As you may know, we are the leading insurance company in Massachusetts in Non-Life.
And we have significant market shares in Auto business, in Homeowners and also in
Commercial auto. As you can see, we are showing a 5% growth in Massachusetts and this
is driven mainly because of our Auto business. As you can see in the screen, I think these
figures confirm that Massachusetts, for us, is a mature and a very profitable state. We are
running the business with a 96% combined ratio. It is worth mentioning that our main
distribution system are independent agents. But we also have a very important
agreement with AAA Northeast.
Outside Massachusetts, as I said before, we have focus on the implementation of all our
profitability initiatives. This is the reason why we are showing a negative 8% growth
outside Massachusetts. As you can see on the screen that most of the reason for this
decrease is coming from our New Jersey book of business, 34% decrease; New York,
17%; and Connecticut, 9.8%. On the positive note, I would like to share with you that we
are seeing some improvements in our Auto business in 2 large core states. I'm referring
to California, with almost 6percentage point improvement; and Connecticut. The figure
you have on the screen had been impacted because of 2 cat events. As you may
remember, we have a tough winter in the Pacific Northwest region, where we have 2
operations; one in Ohio in Oregon and the other one in Washington. The good news is
that the second and the Third Quarter are showing a very much improved loss ratio of
75%. And also, these figures include the impact of Irma in our Florida operations.
Before I move to the next slide, I would like to point out here that we are hoping to see
further improvement in our operations outside Massachusetts because we are going to
be -- start earning all the rates we have taken in those states.
Let's now talk about our restructuring. And you can see on the screen that we have
identified 3 different categories of states: core states, development states and exit
states. We have 11 core states, the one of New England plus Connecticut, Washington,
California, Oregon, Ohio and Idaho. We have also identified 3 development states:
Florida, Pennsylvania and Arizona. And the state I have already mentioned, the state we
are going to be exiting.
Let us look in more detail through each of these states. And let me start with what we are
calling core states, where we want to focus our initiative to have profitable growth. As you
can see, these core states have a contribution of 91% of the premium of MAPFRE in the
U.S. and 135% of the earnings. Actually, these 11 states are showing a 95.5% combined
ratio.

Page 29 of 44

FINAL

Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2017-12-01

Why have we considered these states as core states? The first reason is because our
brand recognition in the New England region. Of course, it's also very important for us,
the scale and the leadership we have in Massachusetts and also our book of business in
Connecticut that also give us some scale. In relation to California, we have a multidistribution strategy that is showing excellent results. And it's also worth mentioning that
we have an agreement with AAA not only in Massachusetts. But also in Washington,
Oregon, Ohio and Idaho. This will help us in improving our businesses in a profitable
manner in these states.
After, we have the category of development states. And these states are the states that
will be subject to further profitability actions. Actually, in both Florida and Arizona, we want
to reinforce our pricing, our distribution fundamentals prior to considering further
expansion plans. In relation to Arizona, I think it's also worth mentioning that this is a
friendly state from a regulatory point of view. And this, I think -- we think, this will help us in
being able to implement all our profitability initiatives. Arizona, as you can imagine, give us
also access to a Spanish-speaking population. In what refers to Pennsylvania, this is a new
state for us. And the figures shows that this is still an immature book of business. But this
will give us the opportunity of having in one state a complementary distribution strategy
between MAPFRE Insurance and VERTI.
Let us now talk about our exiting states. There are, first, New York and New Jersey. Why
we have decided to exit New York and New Jersey. This is a state -- these are 2 states,
especially the one of New York, that are highly regulated. They are very litigious states.
And we also have to acknowledge that there is a -- we have lack of scale. We lack scales
to be able to be competitive. Because of that and because of our high expense ratio, we
have decided to exit these 2 states.
It is another reason for Indiana, Kentucky and Tennessee. Of course, we lack the scale
because we have been operating there for not that many years. But what I think is very
important is that we lack automation. It means that we have to improve our system in
those states. But will mean further investment. The idea for MAPFRE is to focus our efforts
and to focus on our investments in a reduced number of states in the states I have
previously mentioned.
In relation to the exit process, let me first talk about New York and let me share with you
that we have already engaged the services of an investment bank that is going to pursue
the sale of our New York subsidiary, MAPFRE Insurance Company of New York.
As far as Kentucky, New Jersey, Tennessee. And Indiana, we are taking all necessary steps
to produce an orderly withdrawal of our operation in those states. Let me highlight that
we are very much committed, with our customers and agents, to make sure that during
this process, we are able to provide a good customer service to them.
Regulatory compliance will determine the time required to complete this exit strategy.
As I mentioned before, we have a new strategy. And because of that, we also have to
have a new structure to have both completely aligned. The first measure we have taken is
Page 30 of 44



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2017-12-01

FINAL

to reduce the number of region from 4 to 3. We are going to have a new operational
structure, that the idea is to bring the decision-making process closer to the states of
operations, both from a technical and a business development point of view. And also, we
want to provide additional empowerment and accountability to our regional leaders. This
will be underwriting, claims and operations. They will have authorities in these 3 very
important areas. So as you will see, we will be having the Northeast region, East Central
region and the Western region.
I referred before to the importance of digital transformation. And this is very important
not only for MAPFRE USA, for MAPFRE Group. That is the reason why we have been
working in the past two years in the creation of VERTI USA. This is a truly digital insurance
operation. As Jaime said, we did a soft launch last month of October in order to fine-tune
our processes and our pricing. We are looking at making the official launch of VERTI this
month of December. This is a company that is going to be focused in the state of
Pennsylvania and will only offer Auto insurance business.

Bloomberg Transcript

VERTI also plays a very important role for our digital transformation in the U.S., as MAPFRE
Insurance is going to leverage what we are going to be learning out of the VERTI
operation. And we will be able to utilize some of the investment that we are going to
make in VERTI Insurance.
I think it's very important to mention in what refers to MAPFRE Insurance, we want to be a
more customer-focused company and a company that is able to have operational
digitalization. Let me share with you 2 very important initiatives. We have already created
an intelligent automation process competence center in Webster in Massachusetts. And
also, we have been -- we are going to be strengthening our predictive analytics team. We
have implemented during 2017 3 very important models for marketing, underwriting and
claims.
I'm going to finish with 4 key messages, the first one being the new structure we have in
the U.S. to focus on our core markets. As I said before, we want to reinforce our market
position in Massachusetts and New England. And we want to have a very much focused
approach to be able to show profitable business outside Massachusetts. The second
message refers to having a more customer-centric organization with regional
empowerment and accountability. The third one refers, I just mentioned, digital
transformation to meet the changing customer expectations and operational efficiencies.
And the last one and, to me, the most important one, because this shows our
commitments in order to improve our profitability in the U.S. operations are our goals for
2020.
As you can see on the screen, we are looking at a 4% average growth in the next three
years, with a combined ratio of 97% and a return on equity of 8%, in line with one of our
peers in the U.S.
Let me finish by saying that this is our new strategy in the U.S.. And we aim to position
MAPFRE USA for success through a focused business strategy. Thank you very much.

Actually, I would differentiate the short-term and medium-term impact. Short term, I think
that the costs related -- it will be related to severance payments or legal and investment,
banking fees. And we don't expect these expenses to be relevant. What I would like to
highlight is that in the medium term, it's not we are going to be seeing costs. But we are
going to be seeing savings, reduction in costs because of having less administration
expenses, regulatory-related expenses and controlling expenses. And of course, because
of this new strategy, we want to see our loss ratio improving in the following years. And
we don't see, I mean, more expenses than the ones I had mentioned. And as I said
before. And this is important to highlight, we are not expecting relevant expenses out of
this exit strategy.

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much. Next one comes from Francisco Riquel. And it is, what are the
start-up costs that we should expect from the online launch in Pennsylvania?

A - Alf redo Castelo MarÃ­n
Yes. In relation to this, we are having -- we already have the experience because we have
launched our other VERTI operations. And we are going to have a very prudent
investment approach. Actually, we are going to be focusing just in one line of business.
And this is going to be Auto business; and we are going to be focusing in just one state.
And this is the state of Pennsylvania. We are going to be having a very deep control. And
we will be monitoring the performance of the company. And based on that, we will be
aligning the investment. I think it's very important to mention that MAPFRE Insurance, our
traditional insurance in the U.S., is going to benefit. And we are going to see synergies
because of our investments in VERTI.

Thank you very much. Next question comes from Maria Paz Ojeda from Banco Sabadell
(sic) (JB Capital Markets). In Germany -- she wants to know, in Germany, what kind of the
life insurance products are we targeting?

FINAL

A - Jaime Tamayo IbÃ¡Ã±ez
Yes, I'll take this one. Yes. The type of business that we're selling in Germany on the Life
side is essentially risk business. And we're not contemplating at this point any savings
products to be distributed in that country. The way we're distributing this business, as I
mentioned before, is through our digital platform online. We have identified the German
market as a market or an environment where these type of small face-value products are
sold in a sizable and material fashion. So again, just to confirm, just only risk business on
the Life side.

A - Natalia NÃºÃ±ez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Jaime. Next question comes also from Paz Ojeda and is about
Turkey. 2017 has been -- is being an excellent year. And is this sustainable? What could we
expect for 2018/2019?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jaime Tamayo IbÃ¡Ã±ez
Yes. And definitely, '17 has been an excellent year. The results are there, as I explained
before. And the regulation in regards to MTPL, MTPL business or third-party liability Auto
business is -- represents a big chunk of our portfolio, almost 50%. And what we're doing,
we have already started the process of terminating, as I mentioned before, over 400
production sources of this business in the Turkish market. Waiting to this business to come
back to what we understand are technical levels of profitability. Although the regulation
called for a steep decrease in rates, the regulation also produced a slow inflationary
somehow increases on a per monthly basis. So we believe that in the upcoming second
half of '18, we should be seeing a more stable market in this sense. Our commitment to
the Turkish market is total and complete at this point, I would say as well.

A - Natalia NÃºÃ±ez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Thank you. So much. Now we are coming back to the U.S.A. business. Francisco Riquel
from Alantra is asking, do you plan to sell any of the portfolios in the U.S. from the states
that you are exiting? What P&L shall we expect from the portfolios in run-off for 2018, '19?

A - Alf redo Castelo MarÃ­n
Yes. In relation to the first question, we have a legal entity operating in New York. And we
are looking at the possibility of selling this company. In what refers to the other states,
New Jersey, Kentucky and Tennessee and Indiana, what we are looking it has the
possibility of selling the renewal rates to other carriers. What refers to the run-off of the
exiting portfolios, as I have just mentioned, we have been implementing a lot of
profitability initiative in those states and, because of that, we don't see the run-off of
these portfolios to have any negative impact in our performance in 2018 and the following
years.

Thank you very much, Alfredo. We have another one from Francisco Riquel from Alantra.
He wants to know, apart from your core region of Massachusetts and surrounding states
with Connecticut, we -- why do you still remain in so many states?

FINAL

A - Alf redo Castelo MarÃ­n
Actually, as you can see, we're operating in 19 different states. So we have made this
thorough analysis. And we consider that with the actions we are taking, exiting 5 of them,
we can have a more focused approach. And we will -- it will allow us to improve
profitability. We are very committed in being able to improve our results in the U.S.. And
we are going to be making also a very thorough analysis of the performance of the states
we are remaining.

A - Natalia NÃºÃ±ez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

That's very clear. Thank you. So much. Regarding the states, Silvia Rigol from BBVA is
asking. And it is a question that has a lot of interest from the analysts and investors. After
interest rate increases that we have seen in the U.S. during 2017, is there any possibility of
an impairment in the goodwill associated to MAPFRE USA in 2017 or 2018?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yes, I'll take it, Silvia. Thank you, Silvia. First of all, let me say that we're running -- I mean,
we are estimating our assessment regarding our impairment test twice a year. So far, I
mean, we carried out this analysis as of June. And we're preparing for the year-end. So
far, we do not have any evidence -- strong evidence nor weak evidence of any potential
impairment test for 2017. Let me say as well that the -- both the rising interest gives 2
different consequence: a small amount of future cash flows. But also, an increase in our
financial income, that are very well correlated. So we do not believe in the short run that
the -- we can have any impairment test done on the U.S.

A - Natalia NÃºÃ±ez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Thank you very much. This one comes also from Silvia. She's asking about, could merger
between Europe and Asia operation be seen as a way of masked results? Do you
maintain the current disclosure separating by countries? What is the ROE of the new
Eurasia unit for this 3Q of 2017?

A - Jaime Tamayo IbÃ¡Ã±ez
Sure. I'll take this one from Silvia. The restructure and the consolidation into the new
Eurasia region will take effect on -- as of January 1st, '18. So currently, the disclosure
remains total. And will continue to remain total. To give you just a good example, is that
the APAC, the Asia Pacific operations essentially are formed by our insurance companies
in Philippines and in Indonesia. The Philippine company has always been disclosed and will
continue to be disclosed, its results, on an independent and separate basis. And in
regards to ABDA, ABDA is a publicly traded company in the Indonesian market. So the
information is totally public. So the answer is, no. There is no way that we are -- that our
intention is to mask in any way, shape or form the results of any of these 2 regions.

If I may, something regarding the ROE. I mean, the full disclosure within the regions will be
presented at the year-end. And so on for 2019. And so we don't have with us this
information for the Third Quarter 2017.

FINAL

A - Natalia NÃºÃ±ez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Next one comes from Silvia Rigol also. She wants to know if there is
any room to reduce the acquisition cost ratio in Italy, currently in 24.5%.

A - Jaime Tamayo IbÃ¡Ã±ez
Yes. Our Italian operations from an acquisition standpoint, the acquisition ratio -acquisition cost ratio is kind of a blended ratio between the direct -- the pure direct digital
business. And a very important agreement that we have with Fiat, which carries a more
higher acquisition cost. But on the other hand, that this high acquisition cost on the Fiat
agreement is offset by lower loss ratios and lower administered -- administration expense
ratios. So the blended ratio will not see much movement as long as our Fiat business
continues to grow and continues to offset the improvements that we're making on the
other side of the operation, which is essentially 50% of the business, which is a pure
automobile direct business.

A - Natalia NÃºÃ±ez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Thank you. So much. And now, I will ask to the broadcasting, if we can go to the Page 86
of our presentation. This is regarding the MAPFRE Insurance 2020 target, because there
are different questions about that. And I think it's worth clarifying them. These questions,
one of them comes from Silvia Rigol. And she wants to know if the combined ratio and
ROE in MAPFRE USA is an average between 2018 and 2020, or only 2020? And also SofÃ­‐
a Barallat from Caixabank BPI wanted to know if we can give her more additional details
on the guidance provided for 2020 for MAPFRE Insurance? So I think it's worth mentioning
this and clarifying this slide.

A - Alf redo Castelo MarÃ­n
Okay. These are the targets we are establishing for 2020. So this means that we are
targeting significant improvements in our combined ratio as of the First Quarter. So the
Third Quarter, we reported 101% combined ratio. We are looking at being able to bring it
down to 97% in 2020. And the same applies to the return on equity. We are looking at 8%
return on equity in 2020. Now we have reported a 5.6% combined ratio in the Third
Quarter of 2017. So again, we are looking at a combined ratio that is in line with the one of
our peers in the U.S.

A - Natalia NÃºÃ±ez Arana

+++presentation
Hello, again. Thank you for staying with us. Now we have the anticipated closing remarks
from our Chairman. And we have the best panel we could have today for the Q&A
session at the end of the -- at the end of the closing and wrap-up remarks from our
Chairman.
So please, Antonio, whenever you want.

A - Antonio Huertas MejÃ­as
Thank you, Natalia. As we have seen this morning, MAPFRE's underlying results are very
positive, showing continued growth and solid performance despite the cat events. The
impact of these exceptional events was manageable, thanks to our effective cat
protection program, which can still act as a cushion should there be further events in the
year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Additionally, we should expect to see the fruits of the U.S. restructuring plan presented
today. And we will continue focusing on managing our capital position.
I would like to highlight the great exercise that MAPFRE has done today. It's a very good
experience of transparency, facilitating to you clear and complete information about how
MAPFRE is doing things, how MAPFRE is facing the cat events and how MAPFRE is
preparing the future, restructuring its American operations.
At this point, I'd like to send -- to say a few words about the situation in Puerto Rico.
Puerto Rico is a very good country. We know well MAPFRE started to do business there in
1989. Until now, the island -- Puerto Ricans are living in a very difficult situation. The Maria
Hurricane after the Irma Hurricane, both have affected strongly the island. And Puerto
Ricans are now still living in a very difficult condition. As Puerto Rican, having a Puerto Rican
company there, we would like to send our warmest greetings to the island, to the Puerto
Ricans, to our customers, to our employees and, in general, to all of them.
They are still living without enough energy power. Most of the public infrastructure are still
out of service. And they are trying to recover their daily lives little by little. We expect to
help them and to serve the island, to serve our customer with our more excellent services
in these next weeks.
Now let me say a few words about trends and innovation. New algorithms, ever greater
computational capacity and big data, are unleashing technological revolution in our
business. And I believe insurance is going to face more dramatic changes in the next 10
years than it has seen in the past century. Insurance, as we know -- as we know it, buy it,

FINAL

sell it, underwrite it and service it, is changing beyond all recognition. We are witnessing
changes in the essence of the insurance model with the emergence of the new risks,
cyber risk with imitation of the others to cover, for example, manufacturer risk there rather
than drivers and also, the reduction in frequency in many other risks, for instance, much
fewer corrections.
The backbone of all changes we are seeing focuses on the empowerment on the
connected client. Nowadays, control is neither in the company nor in the agents' hands.
It's the customer and that is giving rise to changes in processes, businesses models and,
ultimately, releasing a new digital and connected reality.
There is a key element that should not be overlooked when analyzing the impact that
digitalization is provoking in the business world. And that's the human element. This will
require us to analyze, for example, how these changes affect employment, business and
the organizational changes that we are facing.

Bloomberg Transcript

Based on these circumstances, we have been developing strategic initiatives, which are
changing the profile of our group and how we work. We are promoting multichannel
development as a solid guarantee for growth and reaching new goals. For intermediaries,
it's not only about technology, in other words, digital distribution and service, which is not
necessarily a threat for them. Digital means to have a more effective sales plan, to be
more professional and also to offer the client new opportunities and easier interaction
gateways.
We have also reinforced the internal structure with 3 dimensions: the local, each country;
the regional, it's the geographical grouping of countries; and the corporate level. We have
strengthened self-governance. So we have now agile and flexible decision-making
organizational structures. But which also guarantees a strict control at all levels.
A global corporation, such as MAPFRE, in such a regulated industry can't afford to leave
anything out. The information system and professional behavior of our teams must be
excellent.
The 2016-2018 strategic plan has been adapted to include the following new strategic
initiatives that will enable us to accelerate our transformation. Firstly, SAM 3.0, Automobile
Insurance 3.0 that we are working on that. And the new reality of the Auto, including
connected vehicles and even autonomous ones, with innovative insurance solutions.
Secondly, smart predictive models will reinforce our efforts in the analysis of information
to automate process -- processes and determine trends and behavior patterns.
Thirdly, our large cities plan. The great urban centers are becoming increasingly more and
more important because of the concentration of population and wealth. Insurance
distribution, broad services solution sometimes need to be different for this environment.

FINAL

And fourthly, digital health, strongly linked to what I said before in the previous slide,
believe that in some countries, we need to offer simple and digital solutions for health
insurance.
And last. But not least, the digital challenge, which involves an important transformation
process for the internal structure, new teleworking initiatives, schedule flexibility, shared
knowledge, new forms of remuneration, et cetera. Our people need to be ready for the
new digital world.
We are already working on the first phase of these initiatives, with management and work
groups composed of experts from different countries, skills and with the aim of producing
solutions every six months and achieving the core target by the spring of 2019.
And finally, it's time to wrap things up. We are sustaining revenue growth across every
geographic area in all of our main products. The programs we have already implemented
to enhance efficiency, increase automation and reduce costs are transforming the group
and helping us to increase savings. In turn, we are investing most of these savings in
digitalizing operations to produce a greater return in the medium term.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our financial returns are also beating our peers thanks to the highly professional
management of our investments. The MAPFRE business model and the strategy of
focusing on profitable growth, accompanied by a very high solvency margin at a very low
level of debt, will guarantee healthy growth in the coming years.
Thank you for your participation and active attention in this event. I hope that you have a
new weekend. But before that, now Natalia will lead the Q&A session now. Thank you very
much.

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Antonio. So as we said before, we are going to recover some last
minute questions that have come from the different presentations that we have had
today. First one comes from Juan -- sorry, from Maria Paz Ojeda from Banco Sabadell (sic)
(JB Capital Markets). And it's regarding Eurasia. She wants to know what are the synergies
that could be expected by integrating 2 regions with so many differences, Asia and
EMEA?

A - Jaime Tamayo IbÃ¡Ã±ez
Well I'll take this one and as I explained before, the synergies are related essentially to
the different levels of speeds that we have in our strategies in Europe and -- versus Asia.
We see our European strategy as an immediate short-term strategy, whereas we have a
much mid; to long-term view in Asia in that sense. We believe that by integrating APAC or
Asia into EMEA, the level of efficiencies, resources -- the allocation of resources in order
to support the Asian operation will be certainly increased. The differences inside -- in size,
sorry, which has -- which was outlined in my presentation before clearly show the need for
Page 38 of 44



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2017-12-01

this integration. At the end of the Third Quarter of this current year, total premiums for the
APAC region amounted to EUR 56 million, which is kind of immaterial at this point. So...

FINAL

A - Natalia NÃºÃ±ez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Jaime. Another one for you, I guess, from -- it's for Italy -- it's
regarding Italy. Claims ratio is heavily up in 2017 by 5percentage points. Could you
elaborate what's behind, please? Acquisitions cost ratio is down by 5 -- 50%. Why?

A - Jaime Tamayo IbÃ¡Ã±ez
In regards to the claims ratio, the main impact justifying or explaining this increase is
weather. We have more -- we've had more weather, essentially rain and hail in the -- in our
Italian operations. So this is a question of increased frequency in our business in Italy. In
regards to acquisition costs, it's down. And it's down somehow by design, in the sense
that we have an upcoming rebranding next year into VERTI. So we have decided to slow
down our investments in marketing in order to continue the business. Also, there is
another component of this impact, which is that we're getting much improved reinsurance
commissions from our core strategies. So this would be the explanation.

A - Natalia NÃºÃ±ez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Jamie. Next one comes from Juan CÃ¡novas, Fidentiis. And it's
regarding, can you provide detail about the provision release potential in real estate?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yes, I'll take it. Thank you, Juan. Perhaps I was too optimistic during my presentation. What
I mentioned is that we've seen a positive trend, particularly in commercial units. And also
an increase in trends. They're more -- we see more appetite for latent units as well. But
let me say that we got a huge investment in real estate, over EUR 2.2 billion and any small
release in the real estate provision will be significant. But it is extremely difficult to focus -foresee at the right -- at the moment, if -- I mean, the schedule of releases. And how (the
run up) will take place in 2018. But we are more optimistic that the -- in previous year. But
it's too early to conclude on this.

A - Natalia NÃºÃ±ez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Fernando. And now, we have another one from Michael Huttner in
JP Morgan. He wants to know what's the outlook for the ASISTENCIA in 2018?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Thank you, Michael. I take it as well and let me elaborate a little bit about ASISTENCIA. And
first of all, let me say that there are no promises and that this is the third year of losses.
The first was a small loss; in the second year, we -- where we did just a lot of restructuring
in our business with a lot of cancellation of loss-making portfolio and so on; and this year
we -- let's say, we're cleaning up our assets, writing down a lot of intangibles, goodwill,
software and also changing some the income recognition as well, in order to have a more
solid robust balance sheet. Also, we are reducing as well our overheads, closing down
some operations. For sure, 2018 will be a more positive contribution in terms of a
Page 39 of 44



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2017-12-01

significant reduction in losses. There is still some minor fine-tuning to be done in 2018. But
it's too early to predict that the turnaround point will be in 2018 or perhaps 2019. But the
loss will be significant lower than the -- if any loss in 2018, that -- this current year.

FINAL

A - Natalia NÃºÃ±ez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Thank you very much. This one comes from Silvia Rigol from BBVA, Michael Huttner from
JP Morgan, Niccolo Dalla-Palma from Exane, Paz Ojeda from Banco Sabadell (sic) (JB
Capital Markets). So it has a lot of interest. And the question is regarding how do you
expect to achieve ROE of 11% in 2018? Net profit expected for the consensus is around
EUR 850 million. So shareholders' equity should drop by EUR 1.1 billion to reach this ROE.
Will you achieve this ROE? You already reaching combined ratio target. Impact of
reinsurance on ROE targets? So it's everything about the ROE target.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Antonio Huertas MejÃ­as
Thank you, all of you, for the question. There is an unanimous interest to know how we
are preparing the next year. It's true. Next year, 2018, will be very, very challenging for us.
We have already said that we could expect to reach an 11% ROE during -- at the end -- by
the end of 2018. And we have to work hard. We expect that the units, that they are now
getting excellent result, will continue doing the same thing next year. And units on the
recovery plan, they are doing their best to improve the results and they can contribute
with very positive results next year. And we have already implemented a new cost
contingency plan to reduce expenses and to improve the general amount of our internal
expenses. We are still very positive. We think that we have to do our best. But we think
that there are many factors -- many, many elements ahead of us that can help us like the
tailwinds in order to reach this objective. In terms of the reinsurance pricing, as Eduardo
said before, it's a -- it's early to have a clear opinion about that. But we think that we can
combine our both businesses, that is permanent insurance and reinsurance as well. And
we can assumes and transfer the differences in prices that we can get with the new
renewal of contracts mainly in the Caribbean area. We are still -- as a conclusion, we are
still very positive with our ROE target for the next year.

A - Natalia NÃºÃ±ez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Antonio. Thank you. So much. Now our next question comes from
(Secure Investment). And it's about what is your plan on the Life business in the EMEA?

A - Jaime Tamayo IbÃ¡Ã±ez
Well EMEA, we have essentially 3 operations, Life Insurance operations, one, which is -- in
terms of size, the more material one is in Malta. And in Malta, we will -- the idea, our plan
is to continue building on our competitive position in this market. As I mentioned before,
we enjoy a very strong partnership with Bank of Valletta, not just from a distribution
standpoint. But also from a product production standpoint and a shareholder agreement
in the joint venture that we share with them. So on the savings side of thing -- of the
house, we will continue in Malta to building in -- on our competitive position in that market.
Germany is just a start-up. Germany has a different strategy. The distribution, we do not
have a bancassurance agreement there. Distribution is purely online. And the product that
we have currently in the market is a small face-value or a low face-value product, just on

Page 40 of 44



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2017-12-01

the risk side of the coverage side. Then Turkey, in Turkey, we have a Life Insurance
company, which is small at this point. And our idea in Turkey is to continue growing above
inflation. That is important for us. And given the size and materiality of that operation in
that market.

FINAL

A - Natalia NÃºÃ±ez Arana

Thank you very much, Jaime. Now the next set of questions are regarding the dividend
upstreaming. Ivan Bokhmat from Barclays, Andrew Sinclair from Bank of America Merrill
Lynch, Paz Ojeda from Banco Sabadell (sic) (JB Capital Markets) wanted to know about
this upstreaming. And what level of cash remittance could you expect to be paid from
your subsidiaries to MAPFRE Group in average year as a proportion of net earnings? Also
is bearing in mind the small net profit that MAPFRE will generate this year, what could be
expected for the dividend upstream for 2018? Is it in the same line? Where could GLOBAL
RISK be included in terms of dividend upstreaming? And again, what's the outlook, in
general, for 2018?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yes, I'll take them, there are many. First, I mean, we're quite happy, I mean, with the
contribution of dividend from the International business, one of the lesson we learned is
that we should aim for a better diversification among the regions, otherwise, I mean,
MAPFRE Spain and MAPFRE RE will remain as the cash cow, well the only entities paying
dividend. So we're happy with this 2017 distribution. Regarding the different or the
increased growth in 2017 and its part of the policy I mentioned. And the subsidiaries
should upstream enough dividends for dividends to shareholders, also overheads and
interest expenses. And which is important is any additional capital injection in our
associates because we had to reinforce the capital structure or because we have to
compensate some losses of the current year. This is exactly what happened in 2017. And a
large part of the dividends were allocated for -- increase the capital position of Direct Line
Italy and also MAPFRE ASISTENCIA. So if there is not any significant loss in any unit in 2018,
we spread the upstream flow from subsidiaries to be reduced compared to 2017.
Regarding MAPFRE RE, you mentioned a small contribution. We believe and we expect a
strong net income contribution from MAPFRE RE. So. So far, we expect the same level of
dividends from MAPFRE RE as last year. GLOBAL RISK, what we did is, as you know,
GLOBAL RISK has small stake in MAPFRE -- in MAPFRE EspaÃ±a, it was part of the
restructuring the business. So MAPFRE -- GLOBAL RISK what it's doing is retaining part of
the dividend pay for MAPFRE EspaÃ±a in order to rebuild part of the capital structure. We
don't see a strong contribution from GLOBAL RISK in 2019, since they have to rebuild
again the capital restructuring in order to maintain its current rating, with -- by the way,
MAPFRE GLOBAL RISK needs it for commercial purposes.

A - Natalia NÃºÃ±ez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Fernando. Now we have a question regarding the investment in the
Direct Line Italy business. Silvia Rigol from BBVA asks what's the return on investment of
the purchase of Direct Line? Why it's so low almost three years after the acquisition? The
capital invested was EUR 550 million. Then income in 2017 expected could be in the
region of minus EUR 40 million. And for the next year, it's still expected low income -- net
income.

FINAL

A - Jaime Tamayo IbÃ¡Ã±ez
Well the ROI of our Italian -- essentially, our Italian operation, obviously, is not -- is
negative. We are posting -- expecting an important loss still for this year. Improve -- much
improved from prior year in the range of EUR 14 million. But that -- you have to bear in
mind that we are coming from a loss of EUR 54 million in the prior year. We have been
managing the company. This would be the -- will be the second full year of management
of our Italian operations. We take a long-term view in our operation in Italy. We believe
that our entry into the Italian market in one of the largest automobile markets in the -within the European Union is a major step forward in our international strategy. We have a
sizable market share on the direct digital side of things. And we really will strive to, if not
break even, be very close to break even in 2018. But again, our view is long-term in terms
of our presence in Italy.

Thank you very much, Jaime. This one comes from Paz Ojeda and it's regarding the 2020
combined ratio target in MAPFRE Insurance. This target is -- we have said it's 97% and
that's not including VERTI. Could we expect a similar impact than the one we have seen in
MAPFRE's Spanish motor business line from VERTI Spain?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alf redo Castelo MarÃ­n
I'll take this one. As you can imagine, VERTI U.S.A. is a start-up operation with higher cost,
we have to make some investments in this new operation. But I want to highlight that we
are going to be having a very cautious approach to our investment, our strategy in VERTI
in the U.S. I mentioned before that we are targeting to have a 97% combined ratio for
MAPFRE Insurance in 2020. If we include VERTI in this number, meaning to say, MAPFRE
U.S.A., both VERTI and MAPFRE Insurance, the combined ratio will go up by 1percentage
points. This is our projection for VERTI by 2020.

Thank you very much, Alfredo. Now we have a question from Javier Bernat. He would like
to know if we can give him an outlook for the 2018 Iberia business and, specifically, for Life
Insurance business?

A - Antonio Huertas MejÃ­as
Thank you. As you know, the Life Insurance in Spain is passing a very volatile situation. The
low interest rate environment has (applied) the market to be very conservative selling
different products. Saving products coming from the general distribution of
bancassurance are more weak -- are weaker. And now, all the companies, even the
bancassurance companies are trying to sell unit-linked products where we can get better
returns and to offer better products to our customer. It's very difficult now to see or to
forecast what's going to happen with the life insurance. We expect an increase of
protection products is always a very, very interest in the customer to buy these kind of
products. But as well the unit-link are well received by the customers. And we are creating
new products with very, very interesting return and as well with a mix of coverage that
could be very, very interesting for them. For that, we are putting all of our efforts to sell

these kind of products and trying to make the most of our networks, even the traditional
agents and our bancassurance agreements.

Thank you very much, Antonio. Now the next one is regarding ROE 11% target. Andrew
Sinclair wants to know -- or want us to clarify if this ratio is a headline ROE target or a
return on tangible equity target.

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

No. Thank you, Andrew. It's the pure vanilla ROE. It's not adjusted by tangible or intangible
fixed assets.

So we have 2 more questions. We are ahead of time. So we have 2 more questions. One
comes from Paco Riquel from Alantra. He wants to know if we can update on the outlook
for Brazil in 2018. Do you see premium income growth resuming now that the economy is
turning around? Do you expect to offset lower financial income with an improving
combined ratio? Any specification to improve the high combined ratio in motor insurance?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Antonio Huertas MejÃ­as
Thank you. Absolutely, yes, about the 3 questions. Brazil has lived in very difficult
conditions for the last three years. But now, every figures about the economy showing a
good recovery. As you already know, Brazil is leaving the recession in its economy. And the
forecast for the development of the country, it's more positive about the next year. The
correlation between economy, the growth of the GDP and the insurance is clear. But in
Brazil, it's less than the others because of the lack of penetration of the insurance in the
majority of the society in the country. For that, we are very positive. We think that leaving
apart the situation occurred during the last three years, the next future is very positive in
terms of growth and we expect that. About the second question, if the decrease of the
low -- of the financial income, if we -- it could be upset by the improving of the combined
ratio, I am very positive as well. We think that it's smart. We need to do it and we have to
live with lower interest rates and improving as well at the same time. The combined ratio
mainly in motor unit, you asked in the third question. Motor insurance has enough room to
improve. And we are doing our best to do it. We are reinforcing our teams. We are
introducing new control measures. And we are trying to be more efficient in the motor
unit, reducing expenses, getting better with our agents, trying to improve the
underwriting and claims processes. For that, second question, we are very positive, we will
get better increases next year in Brazil. And we think we can maintain the margins in the
main lines. But as well improving in Auto due to the measures that I have already
commented.

Thank you very much. And there is just one last question that just came in, is coming in
another one from Niccolo Dalla-Palma. But this question is, we have to ask you. Do you
have M&A opportunities? Or do you see M&A opportunities on the horizon for the next 12
months?

FINAL

Always, always.

A - Antonio Huertas MejÃ­as
Always. We are very positive because it's a -- it's natural for MAPFRE to be alert about
new options, new opportunities in other markets. But as well, we are very conservative.
We have defined our strategic markets. And we are clear with that. We are not in a rush to
do not adequate operations. But always, it should be an opportunity for our group. But
now, we don't have any specific operations over our table.

A - Natalia NÃºÃ±ez Arana

{BIO 19480994 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Very clear. So that's all from the Q&A session. I would like to thank
you all the questions that you have sent us. We have answered more than 50 questions, I
think. And the participation has been great. And also I would like, if it's possible, for you to
fulfill the survey we have given to you at the end of the screen, you have. And if you fulfill
that, it could help us to improve in the next editions. Thank you very much. And I don't
know, if our Chairman wants to say goodbye.
