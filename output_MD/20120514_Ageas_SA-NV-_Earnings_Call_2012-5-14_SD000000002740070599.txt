Presentation
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Ageas call for analysts and institutional investors. I
am pleased to present Bart De Smet, CEO, and Christophe Boizard, CFO.
(operator instructions) Gentlemen, please begin.

Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you, all, for dialing in to this call and for being
with us for the presentation of the three months 2012 results of Ageas.
As usual, I am joined in the room by my colleagues of the executive committee,
Christophe Boizard and Kurt De Schepper, and our investor relations team. I will take you
briefly through the main highlights of the past quarter and leave sufficient time for Q&A.
Ladies and gentlemen. our Insurance activities started well in 2012, with improved results
in inflows in nearly all segments, but especially in Asia. Both the performance of our Life
and Non-Life activities evolved as expected.

The net result of our Insurance activities improved by 15%, compared to last year, to
EUR155 million. The positive variance was mainly driven by our Asian segment, up more
than 40% to EUR43 million.

FINAL

Life was up by almost 20%, with good margins, but also overall higher net realized capital
gains.
The segment's Non-Life and Other remained in line with last year, with a combined ratio
of 101.9%, slightly up and mainly as a result of the winter-related events in the Fire
activities in Belgium.
The inflows in the First Quarter increased by 17%, year on year, to reach EUR5.7 billion,
with grow reported across Life and Non-Life at 14% and 27% respectively.
For the first time ever, as you will see, Asia past the EUR2 billion by-quarter level. Of
course, this includes the contribution of our non-consolidated partnerships, which
accounted for a large part of the increase.

Bloomberg Transcript

In total, the non-consolidated partnerships at 100% represented EUR2.8 billion of total
inflows, about half of our reported inflow levels. This contribution was boosted by the
inclusion of the new partnerships in Turkey in Non-Life and in Luxembourg in Life. On slide
4, you will find the full breakdown of inflows by country.
At the Group level, we reported the net negative result of EUR84 million, with a net loss in
the General Account of EUR239 million, and EUR213 million of the latter is related to the
legacies.
Finally, as a key message, our balance sheet has remained strong, with the shareholders'
equity of EUR3.48 per share, and a net cash position in the General Account of EUR1.3
billion as at March 31.
The solvency levels remain stable and strong as well, compared to end 2011, and are at
207% for our Insurance activities, 237% if we include the General Account.
Moving to slide five and the subsequent slides, you will find the traditional details on the
performance of the various Insurance activities. The net result of EUR155 million in
Insurance breaks down into EUR126 million in Life, EUR26 million in Non-Life, and EUR3
million in Other.
The Life performance is up 19%, supported by better financial margins in Belgium, and
strong results in Asia across all countries.
Non-Life was slightly up, EUR1 million, with an improved result in the UK compensating for
a lower result in Belgium. The UK activities benefited as well from some capital gains,
while the result in Belgium remained below expectations, suffering from more claims

costs in Fire and less favorable results in Motor. The contribution from Asia and
Continental Europe remained steady.

FINAL

The segment, Other Insurance, including our UK retail distribution activities, saw a decline
in the net result from EUR4 million to EUR3 million, with revenues up 8%. These figures
underline the tough and competitive retail environment in UK, linked as well to the general
economic conditions.
Focusing now on our four segments, and starting with Belgium, I would highlight the
following. Inflows were satisfactory at EUR1.8 billion, with Non-Life up 5%, and Life slightly
down 4%.
The sales in Life are good, taking into account the continuing low interest environment,
and the fact that we benefited from focused commercial campaigns last year. In Non-Life,
premiums increased across all businesses, but especially in Fire.
Net profits remained solid at EUR78 million, with the Life result up to EUR73 million, fueled
by better investment margin, and Non-Life down to EUR5 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

The picture here is mixed with a better operating performance in Workmen's
Compensation offset by lower results in Fire and Motor, as already mentioned.
I'd like to highlight here as well our decision to review the calculation methodology of the
combined ratios to bring them more into line with market practices for Non-Life products,
with discounted insurance liabilities, in Disability, and Workmen's Compensation. This
impacted, especially, the Belgian segment.
At total Ageas level, the change had a positive impact on the combined ratio of the past
quarter of 0.9%. You will find a detailed explanation on this on slide 10 of the pack. It also
implies that we will no longer report, in the future, a combined ratio excluding Workmen's
Compensation, and the figures for previous year have been restated.
In the United Kingdom, Non-Life gross written premium increased further to EUR534
million this quarter, driven by good growth in both personal and commercial lines, and a
continued growth from Tesco underwriting.
The total net result improved from EUR5 million to EUR17 million this year, fueled by NonLife. The key explanatory factors were the continuing improvement in Motor, together
with net realized capital gains, offsetting seasonal claims in Household related to winter
weather.
In UK, the combined ratio improved substantially, from 106% to 102.3%, thanks to Motor
and Household.

FINAL

This brings me to Continental Europe, where we also saw a sustained net profit, fuelled
especially by good Non-Life performance. The total inflow levels were up to EUR1.1 billion
due, to a large extent, by the inclusion of the partnership in Turkey and Luxembourg, and
increasing the inflows compared to last year by more than EUR500 million.
This masked the lower inflows in Portugal, which benefitted throughout last year from unitlinked campaigns, which were timed to end this year in April and haven't been counted
yet in the First Quarter's inflows.
The net result improved to EUR17 million, with higher results in Non-Life compensating for
the small decrease in Life.
And then, finally, Asia. As already indicated, this segment did extremely well, with
excellent inflows exceeding EUR2 billion for the first time ever, and also a net profit up to
EUR43 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

We are particularly pleased with the high quality of inflows, reflecting the special focus we
have installed last year on regular premiums. Recurring premiums in the First Quarter
accounted for roughly 70% of total inflows, with a noticeable pick up in sales through the
bank channels.
Other positives included double-digit growth percentages in all countries. The net profit
improved, especially thanks to the Life businesses, as a result of further organic growth in
the underlying businesses, but also as a result of some higher capital gains, and also few
positive results[ph].
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like now to hand over to Christophe to take you briefly
through the General Account.

Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Thank you, Bart. So, ladies and gentlemen. I am now on slide 11 and 12, to give you some
explanation about the General Account. As already mentioned earlier in the presentation,
the First Quarter's result of the General Account showed a loss of EUR239 million, of
which EUR213 million is explained by the legacy issues.
This can be broken down by the negative impact of EUR132 million related to the
settlement with BNP Paribas and Fortis Bank on the RPN(I) and the Tier 1 Instrument, as
already announced on February 7 of this year; we released several press releases at the
moment of the transaction.
Furthermore, we have a charge of EUR191 million related to the lower value of the call
option on the BNP Paribas shares. This reflects the decrease in implied volatility, from 49%
at the end of 2011 to 33% at the end of the quarter. At the end of March, the value of the
call option amounted to EUR204 million.

Page 4 of 25



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2012-05-14

These negative elements were partly offset by a positive result of EUR112 million on our
stake in Royal Park Investments, which is now in our book at EUR894 million.

FINAL

You will remember that when we presented the result for the 2011 year end, we already
gave you some hints about the fact that RPI would, very likely, show a recovery in the First
Quarter of 2012, and that is the case with this good result of EUR112 million.
So why is that? We benefitted from higher mark-to-market revaluation of the investment
portfolio. If we take the indices based on the US real estate CDO, things that are in the
RPI portfolio, we have an increase of about 8%.
On slide 13, you have the net cash position. This net cash position increased to EUR1.3
billion at the end of March, this was the result of the settlement of the BNP Paribas
transaction, improving our net cash position from the EUR700 million we had at the end of
last year to the EUR1.3 billion. But this was expected; we mentioned this in the press
release when we disclosed the transaction with BNP Paribas.
One needs to take into account, though, that the dividend payment at the end of May will
reduce the position by EUR200 million. So we will have EUR1.1 billion at the end of May.

Bloomberg Transcript

If we go to slide 14, no comment, apart from the revaluation of the put option, the plus
EUR172 million. You remember that we recognized this put for the first time at the end of
last year. We have to update this every quarter.
There is no impact on the P&L, but we have to review the valuation of the two
components; the present value of the market value of the 25% of AG Insurance, and to
review and to take into account the write-down in the non-controlled interest. And the
balance of these two elements gives this EUR172 million.
On slide 15, you have the solvency, but not much comment as it is unchanged.
And now I would like to go slide 16 and to give you some comments on the investment
portfolio. The total value of our investment portfolio recorded as available for sale on the
IFRS at fair value increased to EUR62.5 million (sic; see slide 16). This is largely due to
higher market value following the overall yield and spread drop on both sovereigns and
corporates.
Unrealized gains increased to EUR3.2 billion, almost double that what we had at the end
of 2011. Most of this increase comes from our bond portfolio.
On slide 17, we give you the second important message with respect to our portfolio. We
have further reduced our exposure to Southern European sovereigns to EUR2.3 billion,
coming from EUR3 billion at the end of 2011. This is the amount at amortized cost after
non-controlling interests; we have not given the fair value here, but the amortized costs
as we think it is a better indicator.

{BIO 15168443 <GO>}

Thank you, Christophe. Ladies and gentlemen. this concludes the introduction, and I would
now like to hand over to the operator and open the call for questions. As usual, can you
limit yourself to two or maximum three questions to allow everybody to ask questions?
Thank you.

Questions And Answers

Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen. we will now begin our Q&A session. (Operator

Q - Benoit Petrarque

{BIO 15997668 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Three questions from my side. First one is on the share buyback. We see you have now
net cash of EUR1 billion after the payment of the dividend. Do you think you could
restore[ph] share buyback, and what would be the trigger for you to start it again? Are
you looking at macro; are you looking at specific items on Ageas' balance sheet, or --? I
just wanted to have your thoughts on that one.
The second question is on the Belgian bonds which increased to EUR17.3 billion. I just
wanted to know where you go on that, and how you look at it now. You talk about redomestication in Belgian operations; do you try to better match the Belgian liabilities; do
you have ratios in mind? Are you going to go further with investing in Belgian bonds?
And then finally on Royal Park Investments. This is the first time the debt figure I think is
below the fair value, so is there any reason to become more optimistic on that one? Also,
you just come back on the 8% revalue[ph] increase you mentioned; I don't really get it. Is
that on the entire portfolio, on specific lines?
And then, could you remember me what is the accounting on Royal Park Investments
under IFRS, because I was not aware that the investments were at fair value, and now you
seem to mention that you have a positive mark-to-market in Q1. So if you could just
remember a bit of the accounting there, thanks.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay, Benoit. I propose to take question one, and start with two, then hand shortly over to
Kurt, our Risk Officer, and Christophe who will take the question on RPI.
The share buyback, I think we have to repeat what we've been saying in the past, is that
we first of all, since the restart of the Company, always have given a lot of attention to the
solvency position, and also the cash position. And that was the reason for the

Page 6 of 25

FINAL

instigation[ph] of the concept of discretionary capital in order not to be obliged, one day,
to rely too quickly to capital markets.
So the order of use of cash that we have announced in 2009, and I would say still stands,
is first, invest in business, then give back to shareholders, and three, use it to pay back
debt holders. If you look to reality of the three past years you can see that the balance
between these three possibilities to use cash has been rather equal, although we have
this priority.
We have almost spent about EUR750 million to EUR800 million for each of the three
categories, and I think, with the buyback last year in August, we have shown that if an
opportunity arises, that we have the flexibility and the willingness to revert the priorities
that we have set in our strategic positioning.
As we have had with the shareholders' meeting of April, first of all the approval to
cancel[ph] the shares we bought back last year, and also again a possibility to if one day
management and Board decides that it is wise and the ideal moment to maybe launch a
second buyback program, the flexibility is there.

Bloomberg Transcript

But at this moment, we take into account a number of elements. First of all, we have to
pay out of the EUR1.3 billion the dividend. We also have to keep some flexibility if there
would be, maybe in the coming period, a further action to be taken in the remaining
RPN(I) CASHES. As we all know, the circumstances are extremely volatile in financial
markets, so we do not have any concrete decision to announce today about a buyback.
This is something that we will, as we did last year, assess continuously.
The second question, the Belgian bonds, we indeed increased our position by, on the one
hand, reducing further peripherals. We also did, in the First Quarter, some sales on shortterm Belgian bonds to replace them by longer ones in order to compensate the duration
gap caused by selling longer Italian and Spanish bonds. We also sold some Dutch and
French bonds.
So we have, of course, internal limits in the sense that we cannot invest in Belgian bonds
until, let's say, 50%/60% of our assets. We have no pressure at all from the Belgian State,
so I would say this is really a decision we have taken in full autonomy, and it will stay like
that.
Kurt, do you want to add something?

A - Kurt De Schepper

{BIO 6240700 <GO>}

I think Bart correctly mentioned the fact that we try to concentrate some of our
investments in our specific liability countries. That's true for Portugal; the same will apply
to Belgium. There are a couple of elements there that play; for one, you know that if you
look at a yield compared to risk that that, perhaps[ph] with those liabilities, appear
interesting.

Page 7 of 25

FINAL

Secondly, and as mentioned before, there is a link in many of our contracts of the
surrender value to the behavior of the Belgian bonds. So in terms of matching, that is a
good match. And finally, I think we can say that we have a good grasp of what the Belgian
macro risk is.
Now as Bart mentioned, we do not allow limited numbers. We are close to the maximum.
We review that, given the macro circumstances, things that are happening around us, and
we'll see how things evolve. Up to now, if we look at market value, that seems to have
been a very good decision.

Q - Benoit Petrarque

{BIO 15997668 <GO>}

To come back on the 50%/60% of the assets, is that on Belgian assets only, or is that on
the entire portfolio?

A - Kurt De Schepper

{BIO 6240700 <GO>}

The number that Bart mentioned was just a limit. We have not communicated on our exact
limits; it's lower than the 50%/60% that was mentioned now. You can say that, if we look
at the current situation, we are close to the limits we used to apply.

Q - Benoit Petrarque

{BIO 15997668 <GO>}

Okay.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kurt De Schepper

{BIO 6240700 <GO>}

And then the last one, the RPI?

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

On RPI. You have more detail on slide 40 of the presentation, that's the usual slide where
you have the KPI, you are right that we have good results, and we are more optimistic on
RPI. We have registered some positive elements as the increase in value. The 8% I
mentioned is an overall increase in the mark-to-market valuation of these instruments.
Most of them are related to US financial instruments, but you have this kind of index on
some websites.
But what I would like to highlight is the fact that, at the end of March, we were more or
less at the top[ph], and since end of March there is no further increase. So we will see
what the Second Quarter will give, but this was expected, as I mentioned in the
presentation. We already said that when we presented the year 2000[ph] results.
Among the positive elements, you are right in when we read the slide 40 it is the first
time that the fair value of the portfolio is above the outstanding debt. You remember that
last time, when we presented 2011, it was exactly equal, and now we are well over -- well
over by EUR500 million -- but we are on the right track, I would say.

Q - Benoit Petrarque

{BIO 15997668 <GO>}

To come back on the 8%, the fair value on the IFRS was EUR6 billion last year. I think you
had around EUR500 million of redemptions of principal, and now it's still the same level,
it's around EUR6 billion fair value, because of these 8% value increase.

FINAL

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

You have two elements. The fact that you have some redemption, but the fact that you
have increase this in the mark-to-market valuation, is the reason why you are still at EUR6
billion on fair value, but you have two opposite movements here.
And then I would like to give you some hints about the accounting, as you requested. You
are right, that the change in fair value, the changes go through P&L, are recognized for
P&L, but then you have an off-setting element, which is the impairment on the goodwill.
So you have these two big elements.
If you want to have a very well-structured and precise explanation about the accounting,
you should go to page 42 of the IFS; page 42, you have all the story. But you are right, the
change in fair value goes through P&L.

Q - Benoit Petrarque

{BIO 15997668 <GO>}

All right. Thank you, very much.

Operator

Bloomberg Transcript

Robin Buckley, Deutsche Bank.

Q - Robin Buckley

{BIO 3596512 <GO>}

Three questions, if I could, please. First of all, sorry just to come back to this question of
the buyback, but following up on your answer there, there seem to be two issues that
you're thinking about. Firstly, whether the opportunity to do the buyback is optimal; and I
guess by that you're thinking of the share price and returns that you would generate from
doing the buyback?
And then secondly, you were just talking about the potential other uses of the net cash
proceeds. So I'm just trying to work out which one of those two options is weighing most
in your mind. Is it you think that doing a buyback now's not attractive enough in terms of
returns? Or that there are just these other things that you'd rather keep the cash for?
The second question is just, having looked through the results, and looked at the
Continental European Non-Life result and the UK Other result, those continue to remain
relatively small in absolute numbers.
Given this was where you have done some recent acquisitions, I was just wondering if you
could perhaps comment on what the earnings for the Kwik-Fit Insurance, Castle Cover,
and the AKSigorta acquisitions are, whether those continue to be on track, in terms of
your plans, and how we should think about those earnings progressing in the future?
Page 9 of 25

FINAL

And then the final question is just related to the Non-Life operations, and I guess for
change in methodology that you have in the calculation of a combined ratio. You used to
speak about a 100% combined ratio target, so I was just wondering whether that target
changes, given this methodology and, indeed, whether or not you think that's achievable
for this year? Thank you, very much.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. For the first question, I tend to repeat what I have said. But on the buyback I think
the most important point in your question is the demand on what we think about potential
other uses of cash. I think that was not the intention of my first answer; we still look at
different possibilities. And I also pointed out in the very uncertain environment in the
eurozone, and everything what happens overall in financial markets.
So we will take into account, and I think it's, at this moment today, we are in an
environment where having some flexibility with cash is certainly, let's say, a stronger point
than[ph] being short in cash. So we will, the day when decision is taken whatsoever, it will
be announced. But it is, as I mentioned, not today the decision to be taken or announced.

Bloomberg Transcript

Two, Continental Europe, of course, as well, if you look to Continental Europe, where we
are active in Non-Life, it's in Portugal where we see that we have an increase in volumes
of some 5% where the market is more down. We have a more status quo in Italy, because
we wanted to give priority to profitability instead of volumes. And coming from a
combined that was in the beginning in above 105%, we are now in the lower 90%s.
In Turkey a bit the same, we had an acquisition not more than a year ago where the
combines were about 100%. By the end of last year, it was slightly under 100%s; this was
also the case in Q1. Volumes go up, so we always said that we tend to work towards in the
11-plus-% return on equity in a timeframe of some three years, and see, let's say today, no
reason not to believe that that will be achievable.
In the UK then, the impact of the distribution, there we could say that the contribution we
expected from Kwik-Fit, Castle Cover was triple. First of all, it's about an additional net
profit from the activities itself; second one was an additional net profit generated by the
fact that these distributors could generate additional business for Ageas Insurance
Limited in the UK; and the third was that they committed to reduce overall overhead costs
to create synergies.
And I would say for the first element, the increase of business and related net profit, is
today not yet at the level of our expectations, because there has been rather some
competition, and also a rather general economic difficult situation in the UK. So you could
say the first part is not today at a level of what we expect. The two other ones, so the
additional business to Ageas Insurance Limited, and a reduction of overall costs, has been
realized, even a bit more than what we expected.
So I would say this is something where we are on schedule, but also there, the real return
on equity achievements will be to be expected within two years.

FINAL

So if we look to the overall picture, the decision to invest further in Non-Life has also the
big ambition to create more diversification across Europe, we've seen too much. Also, the
First Quarter is a sign of that, that climate events in UK and Belgium are rather correlated
by being in more southern and eastern regions; we see that there is a diversification.
We also see an impact of different cycles in pricing and so, with the exception of Belgium
and UK, where we still are a bit above 100%, we are rather below 100% in all the other
areas where we are.
For the combined ratio, I would pass over to Christophe maybe to give some
explanations on the restatement, the impact of it, and also the target for the future.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Thank you, Bart. So on the combined ratio, the short answer is no, at this stage, we don't
want to change the objective, and the longer answer is the following.
First, the number of lines of business which are concerned is very limited. So at the end, it
is Workmen's Comp and some disability guarantee in the health lines of business, but it's
very limited and it regards Belgium and, to a smaller extent, Portugal.

Bloomberg Transcript

Why we won't change the objective is that, in the past, we used to communicate on
combined ratio without Workmen's Comp included, because here we had this long
duration in lines of business with a lot of effect coming from the discontinued reserves.
So what we trade is we've maintained the objective, but we include Workmen's Comp in
the combined ratio. So all in all, we don't think that it was worth changing the objective.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Also to finish that point, I think that when we say that we target 100% combined ratio, that
is a simple translation of our return on equity targets, so that remains unchanged at 11%.
So it means that in the hard[ph] part of the cycle, normally you do better in a percent, so
we still have some work to do as mentioned in the quarter also, to further improve the
combined to reach the target of 100%. Once we are there, we see that we are really
recurring[ph] able to reach that 100%; we do not exclude to put the ambition a bit lower.

Q - Robin Buckley

{BIO 3596512 <GO>}

100% this year, is that still likely?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

That's, in any case, the target we have set ourselves that we also use internally, towards
all the (inaudible) in terms of short-term incentive and so the target did not change.
Because, as explained, it is due to weather events. It came in the First Quarter where we
expect, in our target setting, some weather events and unfortunately, they came quickly
Page 11 of 25

early in the year and we hope that we will not pass our budget over the full year.

FINAL

That's great. Thank you, very much.

Operator
Michael Huttner, JPMorgan

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

I had a couple of questions. One on the Life operating, which seems a great number, how
much of that relates to the businesses where you can actually draw cash down, and how
much is businesses where you have no influence on whether there can be dividend or
limited influence? If you could maybe explain the dynamics there.

Bloomberg Transcript

The second, in terms of court actions, can you just say where you are now? I'm new to the
stock[ph], so I always struggle a bit. Is there anything pending, about to be announced, or
big thing which has been announced which is being renegotiated; anything like that would
be huge[ph]?
And then the last thing, on the put option, could you explain what this is? I understand you
went for the accounting, but I don't actually understand what the underlying is. Does it
have an impact on the cash you have, or is it a non-cash liability? I wasn't quite clear
whether I should pencil it in as being a potential positive for your dividend or buyback
ability. Thank you.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

I'll take the first question. The second is for Kurt and the third will be taken by Christophe.
If we look to the Life operations results, so the EUR126 million, EUR73 million of it is
coming from Belgium, so this is one where we expect, on a recurring base, dividend
upstream. Last year, it did not happen due to the Greek impairments.
We have EUR14 million coming out of Continental Europe; I would say a comparable
situation. There is EUR39 million coming from Asia where, of course, part of the EUR39
million is our Hong Kong entity where, again, we have some more flexibility than in the
four other joint ventures in Asia.
So I would say a big part of the Life profit is entities where the flexibility to upstream part
of the result is rather realistic.

A - Kurt De Schepper

{BIO 6240700 <GO>}

On the second question, Michael, the line was pretty bad; I understood that that was on
our court actions. There, we had those recent judgments, I guess those are pretty clear. A
number of them have been appealed.

As for things to come, things in court are always uncertain. I do not expect many, many
changes. We think and we commented that in the presentation on page 20, we think that
there may be an evolution of the FCC case. And perhaps in the investigation in Belgium,
we could see something coming up before year end.

FINAL

Then the third question, could you please repeat it? Was that on the RPN(I)?

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

No, it wasn't the RPN(I). I think it's not. It's the EUR172 million you show in the roll-forward,
what you call the revaluation put option. I didn't understand what it relates to, whether it's
cash. I'm new to this, so anything which you could say would be very helpful. Thank you.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

This is explained at length in the IFS, and was one of the main topic of the closing of 2011.
In a nutshell, we recognized here the put option that BNP Paribas has on the stake it has in
AG Insurance, 25%.
And the recognition that we have in G Accounts is compulsory under the IFRS rules. And
you have to consider that IFRS, in that case of option, imposes that you book as though
the action is exercised.

Bloomberg Transcript

So it means that, at the end of our agreement with Fortis Bank, we had to buy back the
stake of 25% and, in that case, you have a change in the non-controlling interest.
Once again, the way it is recognized, it is as though the option is recognized. So in that
case, you have to book a liability in your account corresponding to the net present value
of what you will have to pay at this moment, and this is the market value at this moment.
Against this, you have a write-down on the non-controlled interest. And why do you have a
difference, because the way the two components are evaluated are different.
On the liability, you are at the net present value of market value, so what we expect to
pay at this moment. On the non-controlled interest, you follow the results of noncontrolled interest, so you are on the shareholder value of AG, and the shareholder value
went up in Q1 of 2011. It's the reason why you have this positive balance.
You should go to page 54 of the IFS, note 21; you will have all the explanation maybe
more clearer than what I've given to you. But I've done my best to be short and to give
the substance.

Q - Michael Huttner

Lovely. Thank you, so much.

Q - William Elderkin

{BIO 3349136 <GO>}

I've got three questions, please. First of all, could you just comment on the overall
sustainability of the net profit in Insurance you've reported over the First Quarter, the
EUR155 million? I can see there's a couple of small positives here and there, but
particularly if you could comment in relation to a level of normalized gains we should
expect coming through the Belgium Life business and particularly, perhaps, in relation to
the accounting of the Property portfolio and unrealized gain that you have there?
Secondly, can you give us an update on the solvency of your Portuguese joint venture and
how resilient you expect that solvency to be?
And finally, I just wondered whether you've been undertaking any contingency planning or
stress testing in the event of a Greek exit from the euro, particularly given your still
substantial southern European exposures?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. The first point, the sustainability of Insurance profits. As you know, we do not give
an outlook on profits, and I think it's also, in the current financial environment, quite
difficult.
What you can say is, if you compare the First Quarter results to the ones we had a year
ago, because with some of the comments we talked about higher capital gains and so on,
you should see that the difference in net impact, compared to First Quarter last year, is
about some EUR10 million.
So you can say, in Belgium, we have had a net impact of EUR2 million more net profit out
of capital gains, compared to last year. In the UK it's about some EUR5 million, and you
also have some EUR2 million in Asia.
So knowing that we also had cap gains a year ago, you could say that with EUR120 million,
EUR125 million if we adjust for capital gains and weather[ph] costs you could set kind of an
underlying result off Q1, being EUR85 million Life, EUR25 million Non-life, and EUR5 million
in Other.
The second question was about solvency in Portugal. Kurt, could you update us.

A - Kurt De Schepper

{BIO 6240700 <GO>}

The solvency in Portugal is at about 200% now; you know that in Portugal we put a
significant amount of assets in held to maturity and so the valuation on that portfolio is not
reflected in that number.
Overall, because of the evolution of the First Quarter, we say we see that the level of
market values go up, compared to the cost factor[ph].
Page 14 of 25



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2012-05-14

The stress testing on the Greek exit is a difficult one. Yes, we have been giving that some
thought and, generically, we think that there will be an impact, but not something that
would have a dramatic impact on the whole.

FINAL

The numbers, as you know, we say that we do not take any remaining capital gains
position when it's netted into accounting our solvency numbers, and please do note that
the Greek exposure itself is virtually gone.
So it is about, what is the side effects, and you know as well as I know that it's very difficult
to estimate that, but we're feeling pretty confident about the situation.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Maybe a point I forgot to answer in the first question was the treatment of real estate. We
have real estate at amortized cost, so it means that you have, of course, the income from
rents, but we also have every time the depreciation of the assets. So this is the reason
why we have some EUR1 billion unrealized gains that you could say, over time, should be
passing through P&L if we manage this portfolio in a dynamic way.
And so normally, every year, we expect a certain amount of capital gains to be realized on
the real estate portfolio. In Q1 none of it has been included, because we did not sell any
building of any importance.

Bloomberg Transcript

The last question, Kurt, was more about the stress testing not only on the Greek exit, but
also the other countries I understand, other peripherals.

A - Kurt De Schepper

{BIO 6240700 <GO>}

Yes, the stress testing that we did was, indeed, make some calculation, some hypothesis
what could be further impact and, in general, we consider that out portfolio is pretty
balanced.
The big question is whether one moment in time would confronted with other defaults
and then, of course, the scenario becomes very, very different.
I think that concludes my answer to the question.

Operator
Albert Ploegh, ING.

Q - Albert Ploegh

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

A few questions from my side. First one, to come back on the Royal Park Investments, I
guess with the situation improving is there also maybe any opportunity maybe to sell your
stake to a third party or to sell maybe part of your stake; is it something that may be on
the agenda?

Page 15 of 25



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2012-05-14

Second question is, you mentioned something briefly on the FCC situation, but also
what's the situation with the mandatory convertible securities, with now elections coming
up in the Netherlands. Will that have any impacts in terms of potential negotiations; do
you expect delay there?

FINAL

And my third question is on the equity portfolio of EUR2 billion; you said still fully unhedged portfolio, or did you take our maybe some protection during the quarter?
And maybe one final comment to come back on the profit run rate, as I think you
mentioned EUR115 million to EUR120 million in Q1 if you claim[ph] for capital gains. Is that a
number you feel still comfortable with some kind of a run rate, or is there may be an
exceptional strong Q1 still? Thank you.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

I take the question on RPI. We don't want to sell or to review our stake for the simple fact
that, in case we had discussion with a third party, it is obvious that the base of the
negotiation will be the market value. So it means that we would lose most of the upside,
which is represented by the goodwill, because what we want to achieve is to have
recoverability[ph] value, which is much higher than the market value.

Bloomberg Transcript

So as I said in my previous answer, we have some improvement, market value is above
debts, but that is not sufficient. If we traded at market value, we would have a loss.
So I think it is too early to think of selling our stake in RPI. And what we would like to do is
to further improve the situation in RPI, but there is no intention to sell at this moment.

Q - Albert Ploegh

{BIO 3151309 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

FCC, I think we also mentioned in the past that we, as well as our counterparties which
are ABN AMRO, Dutch State, at the end would prefer a settlement compared to longlasting legal procedures.
You have, of course, a number of outside elements that sometimes can impact that. One
of them has been a number of Parliamentary discussions in the Netherlands with the
famous Commission de Wit, having elections maybe also can influence that.
But I think it's also important to mention that, as of the end of last year, the management
of all these files that the Dutch Government has taken initiative to intervene in the financial
sector in the years 2008, has been, let's say, delegated to a kind of a more neutral body
that is not immediately followed by the politicians. And okay, that probably could keep the
directional thinking a bit away from the more emotional reactions around elections.

Page 16 of 25



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2012-05-14

But as also mentioned in the documents, we continue in parallel the legal procedures, and
so for the FCC it's maybe one of the files where we might expect some progress in the
course of this year.

FINAL

A - Kurt De Schepper

{BIO 6240700 <GO>}

Now on the question on the equities, let me remind you, and you have the detail again on
page 35, that in the EUR2 billion equities, what you could call true equities, equities and
equity funds, represent more or less half of it, and there is a big chunk of real estate
funds in there.
The equities are situated in the consolidated entities situated in Belgium where we run
then to a protection of CPPI mechanisms, so we did not take any additional exposure
there, or protection there.
We did take a hedge in our Asian exposure, and we think that with those, at this moment
in time, we can stand some of the volatility.
As for the CPPI mechanism, I suppose that is a mechanism that is known to you; if
required we can give more detail. But basically, it is a mechanism that makes that, when
market goes down, you have an automatic selling process that starts up.

Bloomberg Transcript

And then finally, perhaps last comment on equities, you know our accounting mechanism,
where when you are below the water since a year or below 25% that you have an impact.
So as time goes by, we may see some volatility coming up there.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

The last question was whether the Non-Life result that we referred to, the EUR120 million,
EUR125 million, is a run rate. I would say, yes. But, like always, we cannot predict everything
that could happen. I think, from the positive side, you can have, indeed, the potential to
improve further what is the ambition in Non-Life results.
There is, of course, and I think to the remark from Kurt, that could be depending on the
devolution of the stock markets, additional impairments on equities. But there are, of
course, also still capital gains on real estate that our budget that are not realized yet. So
we believe that the run rate is rather reliable.

Q - Albert Ploegh

A few questions, please. Could you give us the actual amounts of realized capital gains by
entity in Q1?

FINAL

Second question would be, what was the impact in your P&L from downsizing your
exposure to peripheral Europe? And do you see a further downsize, going forward?
And then maybe on the investment portfolio, could you comment on your progress to
diversify to bank loans and intra-structural lending? Thank you.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay, the first question, and I'm giving figures after tax and minorities. So if we look to
Belgium, it was EUR25 million compared to EUR22 million. UK it was EUR6 million
compared to EUR1 million; compared to is always compared to last year. Continental
Europe was EUR1.2 million, compared to nothing. And Asia, EUR11 million compared to
EUR8 million.
So you could say, together, it's about some EUR44 million, compared to EUR32 million.

Q - Francois Boissin

{BIO 16045021 <GO>}

Thank you, very clear.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

For the second question about the impact of downsizing our portfolio of peripheral
countries. First on Greece, you remember that we closed at 23% at the end of last year.
And we managed to sell slightly above. So we have a positive impact of plus EUR5 million.
So it means that it was almost at no cost, but we reduced to almost zero.
Then on the reduction in Italy, the impact is minus EUR33 million, and in Spain, minus
EUR28 million. So these are limited amounts.

A - Kurt De Schepper

{BIO 6240700 <GO>}

So in total, it's about EUR60 million, because there is some compensation in the whole
pack[ph] of course, that we've done.

Q - Francois Boissin

{BIO 16045021 <GO>}

So this negative impact was more than offset by gains on what type of securities?

A - Kurt De Schepper

{BIO 6240700 <GO>}

Yes, indeed.

A - Christophe Boizard

{BIO 15390084 <GO>}

Yes, on other bonds, on some core[ph] country without entering too much into detail.

rates.

FINAL

A - Christophe Boizard

Then your third question was about the diversification of the asset allocation. So we are
making progress. You may remember that, during the last call, I mentioned that my
objective was to have some agreements up and running by the end of Q2. And I confirm
that it is still my objective. We are in advanced discussions with some banks, and I think
that we will be ready before the end of Q2.
And as I said, I confirm that the objective is to start with a 5% asset allocation, so
something about EUR3 billion. But, obviously, we will progressively reach this amount,
because the portfolio that we want to be in are not large enough to have a sharp rise in
the commitment. But it will be, over time, the 5%.

Q - Francois Boissin

{BIO 16045021 <GO>}

Yes, absolutely. Okay, thank you very much.

Bloomberg Transcript

David Andridge, Morgan Stanley.

Q - David Andridge
Just a question on your Asian Life business. We saw a strong improvement in the
technical[ph] margin, and I was wondering if that was going to be a sustainable result,
going forward?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

What we have seen is that, of course, you have the positive impact of, on the one hand,
further inflow. As mentioned in my short introduction, a first consequence of the fact that
we really supported, last year, the move from more single premium to regular premiums
that are, on average, more profitable.
So the part of the increase of this year is, I would say, the result of the high sales in regular
premium last year, and a very good persistency. The persistency, with the exception of
Malaysia where it still has to improve, is in most of the countries are reactive at 80% or
higher. If you look in to the press release I think we also tried to not give the impression
that the Asian result is one that you can multiply by four. So that would be creating a too
optimistic view.
I would say that, in line with what we did previously in trying to give you an underlying
result, that you should be able to expect, for Asia, a one-year result of some EUR100
million, which is above last year's level, if you correct it for the exceptionals we had in
Hong Kong, and in the equity markets.

Q - Benoit Petrarque

{BIO 15997668 <GO>}

A couple of questions. Just on the Portuguese JV, are you considering exiting the
Portugal? We have seen a transaction with Credit Agricole and BES; I think they sold their
BES Vida, the 50% stake. Will you be considering doing the same, considering you
probably want to decrease your exposure to Portugal?
And on the 5% target for the bank loans over time, what kind of yield are you looking for
right now? So you were talking about transaction potentially for Q2. What will be the yield,
please?

Bloomberg Transcript

And then on the slide 16, I see gross unrealized gains up to EUR3.2 billion, but I think you
just referred to the gains while[ph] you have probably positioned with also large losses.
So could you also comment on your gross unrealized losses, because I think the net
increased by EUR700 million on the investment portfolio? So I just wanted to check that
with you. Thanks.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay, in the past when we were questioned about Portuguese JV, the question was
more, will you increase your stake? And our answer was that we were not intending to
increase our stake, as we were happy with the 51%, 49%. Because it's also keeping, not
only our partner in the bank, but also the Portuguese Government fully involved in the
entity.
Now we have had to cope, in the past two years, with some tough situations in the
market, and also for the Portuguese banks, and think really works to change the business
model towards more Non-Life, more protection business, and more unit-linked, by
reducing substantially the saving insurance sales, because this was not sellable at a
profitable margin.
And the advantage of that will also be that, over time, the capital to be invested in the
entity will naturally decrease.
So Millennium bcp, the bank, has also had a complete change of management. We met in
the past month, sometimes with new management. They have not, at this moment, the
first priority the JV, although they continue what the previous management did to support,
as much as possible, its development. But we expect that potential discussions on what
the future of JV might be for them also will come up in the coming quarters.

we never exclude whatever option, if it is an option that would be beneficial for

And on the yield of the corporate loan, the range is between 180bp to 150bp; the spread,
the 180bp more for real estate. If we take into account our constraints, we are more
interested in the infrastructure, we are more around 300bp.

A - Kurt De Schepper

{BIO 6240700 <GO>}

And then on your last question, on page 16 we detailed the unrealized gains between
fixed income and real estate, which are the main components. If you look at the gross
unrealized gains on fixed income, you have the full detail on page 37 of the interim
financial statement, the largest negative positions in that amount. So I confirm that it's a
net amount of gains and losses. The largest amounts are concentrated in Portugal and
Italy; Portugal EUR155 million and Italy EUR129 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

Two comments I have to make; the numbers here are, the available for sale on the
Belgian portfolio, there is an amount of EUR4 billion, and ultimately that has also a positive
position. As for the Portuguese, you know the amount that has been put in to maturity and
there is, of course, also a relatively small negative position on that. So there's no real
large losses as you mentioned, at this moment in time.

Two follow-up questions, please. First one on what you are seeing in terms of P&C[ph]
prices in your main markets, if could comment a bit on what you saw in Q1 and the
outlook?
And second question was on the what you are seeing in Belgium and we saw a few
players actually focusing on savings products, guaranteed products in Q1, with special
campaigns, and other players focusing on unit-linked. You are basically downsizing your -seeing that you lost market shares in Belgium, could you comment on what you are
seeing on that market, and where you want to go? Thank you.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

The first question you ask was on rate increases in P&C?

Q - Francois Boissin

{BIO 16045021 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Okay. So what we see is that whereas in the UK there is a kind of more stable level of
prices, there has been in some pressure by the end of the year, mainly coming from
some direct insurers, but that pressure is gone again. So the way to increase rates, if
needed, is again open. But don't forget that we have seen rate increase in the UK over
the past few years of our accumulated base, some 50%. So it is a long way[ph] that has
been gone.

Page 22 of 25



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2012-05-14

FINAL

In Belgium, we continue to see rate increases. If you look for instance to AG Insurance on
its own, the increase of Fire inflow was some 10% in the First Quarter, and 6% of that was
price increase, and 3.4% was more portfolio growth. If you look to Motor, some 2.3% was
for the tariff increases. As you know, this takes almost two years before the full portfolio is
gone through this process.
And I would say, with the weather-related events that we have known in Belgium for now
the four/five past years, this is something that is rather accepted by the public as a whole.
So it's not that there is huge competition from some players to attack the more traditional
players. So the market share in Non-Life also increased and continues to increase for
Ageas Insurance quarter after quarter.
If we then look to the second question, the savings product unit-linked. If you look back,
unit-linked products always have been primarily sold by banks, so bank insurers. Banks are
more and more, let's say, driven in their commercial approach to the clients by MiFID, and
by the profile they make of their clients. And our main partner, which is BNP Paribas, Fortis
Bank has an overall rather prudent client base; I think that 90% of their clients have a more
defensive profile. So it means that they are very cautious in offering unit-linked if it's not
fitting with the investment profile of the client.

Bloomberg Transcript

So what we are working on, and we see the first progress at the end of Q1 and expect
that will be positively impacting the next quarters, is that with a new series of unit-linked
products with a capital guarantee, that we expect sales to go up. They will not go up to
the level of the number one player in Belgium in this area, which is KBC.

Q - Francois Boissin

{BIO 16045021 <GO>}

Okay. And with regards to the guaranteed products, what is the level of rate that you
guarantee on your business? And how would you describe your positioning versus your
competitors?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Let's say, in the Belgian market, the guarantees offered, you know there's always a 0%
guarantee offer, but the highest guaranteed offers are between 2.25% and 2.75%. AG
Insurance was in part of First Quarter 2.75%; this will now be lowered for a number of
products, to 2.50%. There also have been products where the cost loadings have been
changed from a one-off upfront cost[ph] to a one-off upfront cost, but also a regular
yearly cost loading on the funds under management. Which means that you could say
that, on average, the competition is around 2.25%.

Q - Francois Boissin

{BIO 16045021 <GO>}

Okay. And competition is more aggressive, or just in line with you guys?

A - Bart De Smet

{BIO 16272635 <GO>}

Well, let's say it depends. It's, in many cases, also linked to campaigns. What we see is
that some players move up, others go down. So for us, a much more important point of
Page 23 of 25



Company N ame: Ageas SA/N V
Company Ticker: AGS BB Equity
Date: 2012-05-14

FINAL

comparison is not the gross inflow, but it's the funds of the management. And there we
see that AG Insurance still have some 27% market share in Life in funds under
management.
The point we raised end of last year was that we expected, and we have seen it in
November, a huge competition from the State bonds in Belgium; that's not been
replicated. Of course, at that time, the 10 year bond in Belgium was almost 6%; today it's
a bit more than 3%, so that offer has become less attractive for clients.
Also see that on savings amounts, accounts in[ph] banks offer 1% plus some loyalty
premium, and as you might have read today some EUR225 billion is currently on these
savings accounts, coming from some EUR200 billion a bit more than a year ago. So the
appetite of Belgian citizens for more risky products is still rather low.

summarize this call with main conclusions, two of them. First, the results have been good
for our First Quarter, typically impacted by some seasonal effects. Inflows levels are
excellent, and this is also reflected in our expectation for the year, where we expect
inflow globally to out-perform the ones we had in 2011.
At the Group level, we cannot ignore the important progress that has been made this
quarter in solving part[ph] of our legacies, both the transaction with BNP Paribas on the
CASHES and the Tier 1, and the initiatives to further simplify and align our legal structure,
are important steps.
I think this summarizes the key points I wanted to convey to you this quarter. Thank you,
once again, for your continued interest and support. Do not hesitate to contact our
investor relations teams, should you have outstanding questions. Thank you for your time,
and I would like to wish you a very nice day. Goodbye.

Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you, all for attending.
