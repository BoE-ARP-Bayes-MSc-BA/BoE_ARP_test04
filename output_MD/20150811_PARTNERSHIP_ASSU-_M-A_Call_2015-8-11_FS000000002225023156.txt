MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Tom Cross Brown

{BIO 1648625 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. My name is Tom Cross Brown, Chairman of Just Retirement.
I'm very pleased to say to you today that we are making a recommended all share offer
to the shareholders of Partnership, which represents a fantastic opportunity to bring
together two very strong businesses together with, as you've heard many times, their
particularly special intellectual property.
The next Slide sets out an overview of the key transaction terms. The proposed
transaction is indeed an all share merger, as I've said, of Just Retirement and Partnership.
Both Boards have unanimously recommended the merger, which will be achieved through
the issue of 0.834 new shares in Just Retirement for each Partnership share.
The exchange ratio is expected to result in a split of 60% to Just Retirement and 40% to
Partnership shareholders, and I'm pleased to say that the largest shareholders in each of
us, because each of us, as you know, have majority private equity shareholders, are fully
supportive and have given hard irrevocable undertakings to accept.

FINAL

A new Board of the combined Group has been agreed, comprising a balance of directors
from each company. I'm particularly delighted to say that Rodney Cook will be staying on
as Group Chief Executive, with David Richardson as Deputy Chief Executive and Simon
Thomas as Chief Financial Officer. I will be stepping down to become Deputy Chairman of
the new Group, and I'm very pleased to say that Chris Gibson-Smith, the Chairman of
Partnership, will be the Chairman of the combined Group.
The combined Group will be JRP Group Plc. We just couldn't bear to make it Just
Retirement Partnership Group Plc. Imagine how long it would take you to type out email
addresses, et cetera, et cetera. But there will be no immediate branding changes to our
propositions, though the new Board will have the opportunity to conduct a branding
review post completion.
Finally, the Board of Just Retirement expects that JRP Group will pay dividends in line with
Just Retirement's existing dividend policy for the first year post completion. As you would
expect me to say, we are convinced and really do believe that this transaction will make us
stronger together, which will be beneficial for both policyholders and shareholders.
With that, I'm very pleased to hand over to Chris. Thank you very much.

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Tom. Morning, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us so early. I'm
Chris Gibson-Smith, and as you've just heard from Tom, I'm the current Chairman of
Partnership, Designate of JRP Group Plc.
We know that this merger is an exciting opportunity. It has strong strategic rationale, and
we'll lay that out before you this morning. It has clear financial benefits. It has better
outcomes for customers and it will create enhanced returns for shareholders, and we'll
show you all of that.
Within our sector, we're currently facing into significant demographic changes and a range
of economic opportunities in the new environment, both in the UK and internationally. And
we are convinced that the combination of these two businesses, which both have, as
Thomas has said, outstanding intellectual property at their core, will allow us to build on
and accelerate each company's existing growth strategy. And we believe that our
strengths will be reinforced and that the differences between the two companies are in
fact complementary.
The greater scale we create with the JRP Group will enhance our existing standard with
trustees in the defined benefit de-risking segment, with these two businesses already
accounting for over 5% of UK bulk annuity transactions in 2014 on a pro forma basis.
In the retirement market, JRP will be an important presence with around 280,000 existing
in-force annuity customers, and with a total population of 12.3m people over 65 in the UK,
both as a future opportunity for the business, as we stand, we are paying the pensions for
around 2.5% of all UK pensioners.

FINAL

This merger brings together the two most customer focused and specialist insurers in the
retirement market, and through our combined scale and combined IPs, we'll compete
more effectively with the traditional insurers. We will position ourselves as the consumer
champion with the intent to further disrupt the markets to deliver yet better outcomes for
our consumers and customers. And we will produce a product set, which serves the
customer throughout retirement and will be differentiated by our specific expertise.
The financial rationale is compelling. Through this merger, we expect at least £40 million
of annual pre-tax synergies. These will drive meaningful earnings per share accretion for
both Just Retirement and Partnership shareholders from 2017 onwards. And the merger
structure allows both sets of shareholders to share in the value creation equally now and
in the future.
Now, JRP plans to raise approximately £150 million of equity as part of the merger. The
strengthened capital position will cover expected non-recurring integration and
transaction costs, provide further comfort over the transition to Solvency II, and underpin
our future growth initiatives and product development, and you'll hear more about that.
And finally, just to say that to this stage, and it will continue, the senior staff of both
companies have engaged very constructively. I've no doubt that they will create a new
force in the retirement market.

Bloomberg Transcript

But to hear about that in detail, let me introduce the Chief Executive Designate of the
new company, Rodney Cook. Rodney?

Rodney Malcolm Cook

{BIO 14008420 <GO>}

Thank you. Thank you, Chris, and a warm welcome to all of you this morning, both here
and on the line. It's my pleasure to be joining Chris, Tom, David Richardson and Simon
Thomas to present this merger to you. Importantly, we also have with us this morning
Partnership's CEO Steve Groves, who's giving this transaction his strong support. I'd also
like to acknowledge Steve's significant contribution as the two of us have worked
together over the past months to get this deal to fruition.
As Tom said, we believe that Just Retirement and Partnership will be stronger together,
and this merger of equals represents a truly exciting opportunity for both of our
companies to accelerate our current growth strategies. You'll see from the deal details it
creates meaningful value for shareholders, with cost synergies driving accretion to
earnings, embedded value and also to capital over time.
It is also, as the Chairman said, strategically compelling. The combined Group will have
increased scale, efficiency and also standing in the marketplace to accelerate growth in its
targeted segments. I would like, of course, to highlight to you especially on that point the
greater opportunities we now will have in the defined benefit de-risking segment.
Also, the merger will strengthen the competitive position of our Group in the fast growing
UK individual retirement market. The merger creates a powerful consumer champion, well
Page 3 of 23



Company N ame: Just Group PL C
Company Ticker: JUST L N Equity
Date: 2015-08-11

equipped to deliver improved value to consumers in that market.

FINAL

Importantly, the cultural fit between our organizations is crucial. Both of our companies
have achieved what they have to date by putting the customer at the very heart of their
strategies, long may it continue.
Thirdly, on a combined basis, our intellectual property will now be outstanding, with our
complementary data – mortality datasets and underwriting expertise coming together and
driving further progress in improved risk selection.
And fourthly, the combined distribution reach that our Group will have creates significant
scope to deepen the relationships in the financial intermediary channel, and to give a
better offering to our corporate business partners, and of course to improve our sales
efficiencies.
Moving then to the right-hand column, of course I know you'll be very keen to understand
in detail the financial benefits of this merger. They are significant, and David will take you
through them in detail shortly.

Bloomberg Transcript

In summary, we are very confident that this is an attractive transaction from both a
financial perspective and the strategic rationale. It will deliver earnings accretion post the
equity raise for both Just Retirement and for Partnership shareholders, following the
complete delivery of at least £40 million of pre-tax cost synergies.
If you now turn to Slide 6, Tom has already covered much of this so I'll just quickly touch on
a couple of the more significant transaction terms. So the exchange ratio has been
agreed between the parties based on the relative contributions from the two companies
to profits, premiums from sales and also capital positions. And importantly, the market
share price performance over the last several months. This exchange ratio, as you clearly
can see, represents a merger of equals.
You should note, as Tom said, Permira and Cinven continue to be strong supporters of
both companies and have agreed irrevocable lock-ins in relation to their shares.
As I mentioned, we expect to generate at least £40 million of annual pre-tax cost
synergies, and that the full run rate will be achieved in 2018. Of course, to deliver those
significant cost savings there will be some integration costs, and we expect around £60
million of pre-tax costs will be incurred over the first two years post completion.
As Tom also said, as part of this transaction we have decided – the Boards have decided
to raise additional equity capital for the combined Group to cover the three aspects: the
integration costs, the transaction costs, to smooth our transition to Solvency II that you all
appreciate is coming, and importantly to support the strategic growth initiatives that we
have in mind. We envisage, therefore, to raise approximately £150 million of fresh equity.

FINAL

As to dividends, we expect JRP will continue to pay dividends in line with Just
Retirement's existing dividend policy for the first full year post the transaction completion,
and of course with the capacity to improve those dividends over time as the combined
Group realizes its cost and strategic benefits.
Given the timing of this transaction, current Just Retirement shareholders will receive the
final dividend later this year based on our performance to June 30, 2015, and existing
Partnership shareholders will receive an interim dividend declared today of £0.05 per
share for the six-month period to June 30, 2015.
Looking now at Slide 7, I would really like to reemphasize the attractions for us from the
defined benefit de-risking segment. As you well know, the UK is one of the world's largest
defined benefit markets, with roughly £1.7 trillion of aggregate liabilities across in excess
of 6,000 pension schemes.

Bloomberg Transcript

And you can see in the top left chart that the bulk annuity market and the de-risking
activities were unaffected by the 2014 budget, fortunately. And you will note from the
forward-looking part of the chart, in the different shading, that recent analysts suggest
that the annual defined benefit de-risking sales may reach a colossal £25 billion by 2020.
So this segment has delivered important diversifications for both of our companies, as it
now represents approximately 50% of the combined annual new business annuity
business for Just Retirement and Partnership. Both of our companies have already
established competitive propositions, particularly in the small and medium enterprise
sector of this market. Individual underwriting based on medical and lifestyle factors has
become an established option for employee benefit consultants advising their mid-sized
pension clients.
Now, looking forward from here, we believe we will become a preferred provider in that
SME sector and also, importantly, will enable ourselves to more effectively compete for
the slightly larger defined benefit cases.
If I could address with you the retail market on Slide 6, the first critical point to make is this.
There is an enduring demand for individual retirement products in the UK. Looking at the
pie chart, various market studies have indicated that around 7 in 10 customers, when
asked, would prefer to receive a pension that was guaranteed for life.
Legislation has also recently been supportive. The abolition of the death tax is applying
equally to guaranteed income solutions and also to drawdown. The FCA's positive
conclusions that annuities bought in the open market are good value and the recent Dear
CEO letter to product providers placed tougher requirements on them to encourage their
customers to shop around, and both of these we feel over time will potentially increase
our addressable market.
As the bar chart shows, recent quote activity levels have been encouraging over the past
four months. Now, this points, in our view, to a potential gradual rise in individual annuity
volumes in the second half of 2015. We believe that this merger will create a stronger
Page 5 of 23



Company N ame: Just Group PL C
Company Ticker: JUST L N Equity
Date: 2015-08-11

retirement income specialist and, even better, to serve the constantly changing demands
of individual retail customers in and at retirement.

FINAL

Vesting pension customers all too often have been rolled over into relatively poor value
products in the past. We believe our improved market position will enable us to give
those customers better value options when they access the open market.
Of course, Just Retirement and Partnership have and continue to be committed to
developing new customer solutions, positioning us to maximize the opportunities in the
post-budget world. We have launched recently retirement focused regulated advice, a
first for the industry. We've extended the TOMAS service to pension scheme members.
We've launched a flexible pension plan supported by a state-of-the-art drawdown
platform, and we've also both launched modern guaranteed income for life solutions. All
of these achieved at around April 7 this year.
Moving to Slide 9, as I said, JRP will continue to be a consumer champion. We will continue
to disrupt markets positively to deliver better outcomes to both pension trustees now,
through defined benefit, and also continuing to retail customers. We expect to build on
the innovation credentials of both of our teams, and through JRP continue to introduce
new products and services to drive further growth in 2016 and onwards using, importantly,
what will now be our outstanding joint underwriting IP.

Bloomberg Transcript

Secondly, we are also better placed, having reestablished a strong basis in the UK, to
invest in new technology, business capabilities and some geographic diversification, the
latter building on our existing initiatives in both the U.S. and in South Africa.
Moving now to the right, let's just remember what it really means for customers in the
open market. We've illustrated here a real example to show the superior value we can
create for customers. This is a typical 64 year old approaching retirement, admittedly with
a moderately impaired medical history.
JRP is able to quote an individually underwritten annuity rate around 20% higher than the
traditional life insurer quoting without those medical and lifestyle factors. This is also a
better value and securer proposition than other product options for customers facing
retirement, such as fixed interest investments and bank account savings.
On Slide 10, one of the key strengths of JRP will be, as I said, our outstanding combined
intellectual property. So together, Just Retirement and Partnership will become the more
effective competitor in guaranteed for life solutions. We believe we can improve our risk
selection that will give greater capital efficiency through individual underwriting based on
those medical and lifestyle factors.
Our underwriting capability is increasingly important, both in the defined benefit de-risking
sector and of course in the retail market, where we already participate strongly. We
believe the significance of this individual underwriting will now accelerate both,
importantly, for healthy lives and impaired lives, as the open market option becomes
increasingly accessible to more retail customers.

FINAL

Together, we will utilize the key features of both of our businesses, because we both
have long and substantial mortality datasets. Just Retirement, of course, also has a new
generation PrognoSys underwriting system and Partnership have years of fully developed
mortality curves, and we intend to bring those two intellectual properties together.
We will have around 280,000 in-force customers, as the Chairman indicated, and
alongside that a very experienced medical team to support underwriting of the more
complex individual cases. The outstanding IP will provide clear commercial benefits across
pricing, reinsurance, reserving, and of course future product development initiatives.
So, to my final Slide for the moment. I'd like to talk about distribution. Just Retirement and
Partnership have well-established relationships, five-star relationships, in fact, with all the
major employee benefit consultants, and we expect this merger will serve to strengthen
the quality of our proposition to their clients.
The two companies, as you know, have historically primarily focused on the intermediary
channel reflecting of course our greater past focus on individual business. Our
intermediate relationships are complementary, and of course they will now encompass
the vast majority of national, regional and specialist IFA firms.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now, aside from deepening these relationships in our core distribution channels, the
merger will also be additive to distribution through our corporate partners, as shown in
the bottom left, because Just Retirement and Partnership have relationships with a
number of blue chip institutions, and they are, as you can see, complementary.
And finally, the combined Group will have the enhanced potential for geographic
expansion, levering Just Retirement and Partnership's initiatives in South Africa and the
U.S., as noted in the bottom line.
So thank you for being here with us. I hope you are equally excited by that. I'd now like to
pass on to David to cover the financials for you in more detail. David?

David Louis Richardson

{BIO 18045016 <GO>}

Thank you, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. I'm David Richardson and I am Deputy
CEO Designate of JRP Group plc.
There are clear financial benefits to this proposed transaction. I'd like to focus on three of
those in the coming Slides, namely earnings per share, accretion, cash generation and
capital.
Let me start with earnings per share on Slide 13. We anticipate meaningful earnings per
share accretion on a post-equity raise basis for both Just Retirement and Partnership
shareholders as a result of the merger. This will be driven by the material expense
synergies which we expect to achieve and we expect to be fully phased in by 2018.

Page 7 of 23



Company N ame: Just Group PL C
Company Ticker: JUST L N Equity

FINAL

These businesses are very substantially similar, and hence the combination creates the
potential for pre-tax expense savings of at least £40 million per annum. Those savings
would represent approximately 30% of the combined cost base of the two organizations.
We expect those savings to be achieved across a number of areas. First of all,
streamlining sales and pricing functions through the removal of duplicate quotes, sales
and pricing activity in both the individual and DB de-risking space. Secondly, by reducing
the office space utilized by the two groups. Thirdly, by removing overlapping IT systems,
development, licenses and support. And finally, by removing duplicate corporate
functions.
As I mentioned, we expect those full run rate savings to be achieved in 2018, and expect
to incur one-off integration costs of £60 million, over two years to achieve those savings.
Both Just Retirement and Partnership have recently undertaken significant cost
management exercises to reduce our standalone cost bases in light of 2014 budget
changes. The combined Group's proven expertise in achieving those cost savings
increases our confidence in delivering the synergies that we announced today.

Bloomberg Transcript

It's also worth noting that the £40 million is focused purely on cost savings. We have not
taken account of any other potential benefits – across the combined Group, which may be
achieved through improved commercial terms with our business partners or improved
access to financial markets.
Secondly, and moving on to Slide 14, we see high quality stable cash generation across
Just Retirement and Partnership's two books of business. The combined Group's cash
generation is balanced, with operating profits roughly split 50/50 between new business
and in-force. The relatively shorter duration of Partnership's in-force portfolio
complements Just Retirement's relatively longer duration book, reflecting the varying
severity of impairments within the two portfolios.
In addition, Partnership's 20 years of mortality experience comprises several underwriting
years which are fully developed, enhancing the robustness and maturity of the cash
generation from the in-force books. This will be enhanced further by the expense savings
that we talked about, which will increase JRP's cash generation.
The combination of these factors results in cash generation to support growth initiatives,
an expectation that the combined Group will pay dividends in line with Just Retirement's
current dividend policy for the first full financial year post completion, and over time the
cash generation should enhance the Group's dividend paying capability.
Moving on to capital on Slide 15. As at June 30, 2015, Just Retirement and Partnership's
economic capital coverage ratios were 176% and 156%, well in excess of their respective
Board minimum targets of 140% and 125%, respectively.

Page 8 of 23



Company N ame: Just Group PL C
Company Ticker: JUST L N Equity
Date: 2015-08-11

FINAL

As part of this merger, we have announced our intention to complete an equity raise of
approximately £150 million, which will enhance the capital position of the combined Group
to support its growth agenda. The capital raise will cover the £60 million of expected oneoff integration costs, together with other transaction costs. It will provide further comfort
over the combined Group's position under Solvency II and the transition to the new
regime and also, importantly, provide additional financial flexibility to pursue the Group's
growth initiatives, including product development.
Once the merger has completed, the combined Group will continue to evaluate options
to make its balance sheet more efficient, including the potential for accessing the debt
capital markets.
In terms of Solvency II, on Slide 16, I'll give you a quick update on progress for both
companies. Just Retirement's Solvency II program is on track to deliver its internal model
and application was submitted to the PRA on schedule in May. Partnership's Solvency II
program is also on track, aiming to deliver a standard formula approach. The option of
developing an internal model remains under review, so we can implement that as and
when appropriate.

Bloomberg Transcript

Both businesses submitted their matching adjustment and transitional measure
applications to the PRA during June, as intended. And as you would expect, for the areas
of the regulations where there are potential risks, both businesses are taking steps to
mitigate these, for example, putting in place equity release structuring to ensure they are
matching adjustment eligible assets.
Whilst the formal change of control application and process will be made to the PRA in
due course, pre-notification discussions have been held with the PRA regarding the
merger, including, as you would imagine, the potential Solvency II position of the
combined Group. In line with the rest of the industry, we expect final feedback on the
Solvency II positions of both companies during Q4 of this year.
The Board – excuse me, the combined Board of JRP is confident that we have the plans
and processes in place to safely manage the combined Group in accordance with the
Solvency II regime. In addition, once the businesses have been brought together, we
believe there is the potential for future capital efficiency within the combined Group.
Next, I'd like to move on to give you a quick update on sales and current trading. Both Just
Retirement and Partnership are successfully diversifying their business models, with
defined benefit de-risking sales replacing lower individual annuity sales.
Despite the challenges over the past 12 months, the combined business wrote
approximately £1.8 billion of new business. That exceeds the best year for either company
in their respective histories, so we're showing that we are recovering from the budget
announcements last year. As a combined business, we will be a significant player, well
positioned to compete with the larger incumbent insurers.

Page 9 of 23

FINAL

Across Just Retirement and Partnership, over £320 million of DB de-risking sales were
generated in the first half of 2015, and market feedback points to growing activity in the
second half of the year, which is very much in line with the historic seasonality in the DB
de-risking market.
From a Partnership perspective, we expect DB completions to remain lumpy, but the
current pipeline provides confidence in our ability to achieve our previously communicated
target of at least £200 million for full year 2015. Just Retirement also has a strong pipeline
of prospective DB opportunities, with a target of £300 million of further DB transactions in
the second half of 2015.
In the DB space, the Just Retirement and Partnership pipelines comprise transactions
across a wide selection of employee benefit consultants. This reflects both the increasing
recognition by pension scheme trustees of the benefits of adopting a medically
underwritten approach to DB de-risking. It also reflects the stronger and broader
relationships that both firms have formed with those employee benefit consultants.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the individual annuities front, since April, across both Just Retirement and Partnership,
we have seen a slight increase versus the first quarter of 2015 as advisors and customers
slowly start to return to the market. As Rodney mentioned earlier, customer behavior and
conversion trends have not yet stabilized, but quote levels for individual annuities have
begun to grow encouragingly, pointing towards a gradual recovery in the second half of
this year.
Perhaps slightly overshadowed by the merger announcement, but we are also announcing
our interim results this morning, so I would like to spend just one slide running through
those.
We generated £231 million of sales in the first half and maintained our pricing discipline to
ensure that new business covered its own capital requirements before overhead
expenses. Our cost management actions have been embedded and we are well placed
to achieve our GBP75m target for the full year.
However, as the majority of our operating expenses are new business related, over 90%,
new business profits are sensitive to the relatively subdued level of sales in the first half
resulting from the continued hangover in the run up to pension freedom changes in April.
As a result, in the first half there was a loss on new business of £2 million. This results from
our conscious decision last year to maintain our expense levels out of line with temporarily
subdued revenues in order to protect our technical core. Conversely, as sales recover, we
expect the benefit of operational leverage will flow through to the new business profits.
The in-force book delivered a strong contribution to profits in the first half of £13 million.
This includes positive mortality experience, particularly on our care business, and
increasing mortality margins due to the ongoing growth of the back book, together with
the relatively lower proportion of longevity risk reinsured on DB business.

FINAL

The first-half return on excess assets of £7 million represents a yield of approximately 3%.
As expected, this was lower in the first half as we allocated excess equity release assets
to new business during the latter stages of 2014.
That in total gave first-half operating profits of £18 million. The MCEV increased marginally
in the first half of the year, from £576 million to £590 million, or equivalently £1.44 to £1.47
per share. This increase was driven by the value of new business written in the period, a
reduction in the effective tax rate and partially offset by shareholder dividends paid.
We announced an interim dividend of £0.005 this morning, in line with our 2014 dividend,
which will be paid at the end of October.
So, finally from me, to summarize, this merger represents a compelling opportunity to
deliver clear financial benefits to both sets of shareholders. At least £40 million per
annum of cost savings will drive meaningful earnings per share accretion for both sets of
shareholders. High quality cash generation across the combined Group will support
growth initiatives over time and enhance our dividend paying capacity of the combined
Group.
And finally, the enhanced capital strength will provide increased financial flexibility to
pursue our growth opportunities and provide further comfort over the combined Group's
transition to Solvency II.

Bloomberg Transcript

I'd like to hand you back now to Rodney, who can you through next steps and conclusions.

Rodney Malcolm Cook

{BIO 14008420 <GO>}

Thank you, David. Moving now to the final section of our formal presentation today. Slide
21, the anticipated transaction timetable. Without reading the detail to you, the key
takeaway is we're targeting to complete in December 2015 and now, assuming CMA
Phase 1 approval is granted in mid-October, we expect to post documents to our
shareholders shortly thereafter and hold general meetings for both sets of shareholders
in November 2015.
Of course, the period between now and completion reflects the nature of the regulatory
approvals, both with the CMA and the PRA, that we are required to navigate through. Our
preparations are well advanced with respect to that.
So, before moving to Q&A, I'm not going to read all of this out, very clearly I believe that
we have made a strong case that Just Retirement and Partnership will indeed be stronger
together and, as the sign indicates there, onwards and upwards.
So I'll now move to questions. I respect the fact that while we think it's very exciting, the
Prudential are holding results just shortly and therefore I respect the fact that people will
need to go. But I will start with questions from the room before we move to those on the

line, and please take the microphone and state your name and company. And, Greg,
we're not allowed to have five questions today.

Q&A
FINAL

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Hi. Andy Hughes, Macquarie. I'm very confused about some of the things you're saying.
Obviously, you say both standalone groups have strong capital, great cash flows, and
you're raising £150 million of debt. I suspect the primary motivation for this is Solvency II,
given that your main competitor L&G has basically said this business model doesn't work
anymore and then moving to a reinsurance structure. I appreciate none of this is your
fault, but could you comment on the primary motivation for the deal and whether the two
businesses, if they didn't combine, would still need to raise capital, and what we should
say about capital going forward given that clearly this is to support the capital base of the
Company?
The second question, on the cost savings -

A - Rodney Malcolm Cook

{BIO 14008420 <GO>}

We're only taking one question. Thank you. David.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - David Louis Richardson

{BIO 18045016 <GO>}

Yes. Well, just to reiterate, what's driving this transaction is actually the strategic –
compelling strategic rationale and meaningful financial benefit for both sets of
shareholders. It isn't driven by capital. However, both Boards have decided the prudent
thing to do in association with the transaction is to raise equity of approximately £150
million, so it's equity, not debt.
That is first of all to meet – there's actually some one-off costs associated with the
transaction, about £60 million of integration costs to deliver the £40 million per annum
cost saving, so we think that's a good trade-off, together with some one-off transaction
costs which aren't nailed down but might be in the region of about £20 million.
The balance of that capital raise is really to support both the acceleration of our
strategies, so we view this as an opportunity to accelerate our existing strategies, so
having some financial flexibility to support that growth seems like a good thing to have in
place. And also, it does provide some further comfort over Solvency II.
I would point out that, in terms of the changes that L&G are making to their business
model, we already have that embedded in our business. We have significant longevity risk
transfer on both sides of the house at the moment.

It creates a lot of internal tension when you make me only do one question, so – but we'll
let that tension happen. Just in terms of bulk annuities, if you listen to the commentary
coming out of Legal & General and Aviva on the area that you've started competing in,
call it the SME space, both of them are saying margins have taken a serious hit because of
you guys. How do you square the circle? You're saying it's profitable; they're saying it's
not.

A - Rodney Malcolm Cook

{BIO 14008420 <GO>}

Well, just to be clear, they are actually competing with us in this space, so Aviva and L&G
have underwriting capabilities. So we believe that in the small end of the market, where
individual characteristics for types of companies exist, underwriting gives a better result
than the standard method.
Just so there's no confusion, all of the companies do underwriting, but they don't do
individual medical underwriting. So we also have within our combined Group the complete
skillset to compete with the other larger bulk annuity de-riskers, if that's an appropriate
term, because we do know how to underwrite on the basis of people's pension size,
occupation, postcode and so on. So we're bringing together both of those attributes.

Bloomberg Transcript

David, any other point on the margins on this?

A - David Louis Richardson

{BIO 18045016 <GO>}

Well, what we've seen today and we've said publicly before is that the margins we see on
DB are actually very comparable to the individual annuity space and we've found it a very
attractive segment.

A - Rodney Malcolm Cook

{BIO 14008420 <GO>}

And one of the other Group added benefits, of course, Just Retirement is an originator of
lifetime mortgages. In addition to ourselves there, we wrote another £308 million of
lifetime mortgages and we find that is an even more attractive backing asset in the
defined benefit space.

Q - Gordon Aitken

{BIO 3846728 <GO>}

Gordon Aitken from RBC. Now, actuarial consultants don't like corporate activity and
they're the gatekeepers to defined benefit business in the UK. Just wondering, are you
expecting any hangover from them until the deal completes in December?

A - Rodney Malcolm Cook

{BIO 14008420 <GO>}

I think the obvious answer is we are committed and we have a volume underwritten
arrangement for £150 million. So from an actuarial consulting perspective, they're going to

be presented with a new, stronger, larger capitalized company with another £150 million
of equity. So I think our story just became more compelling for them.
Next.

FINAL

Q - Jon M. Hocking

{BIO 2163183 <GO>}

It's Jon Hocking from Morgan Stanley. I just wondered whether you could comment on the
earnings recognition of the two groups and whether there's going to be any difference
between the standalone companies just in terms of speed of cash recognition.

A - Rodney Malcolm Cook

{BIO 14008420 <GO>}

Simon, is your mic on?

A - Simon George Thomas

{BIO 15219564 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hopefully so. Hello? Yes, it is. Yes. And what I would say is that we've spent a significant
amount of time from a diligence perspective working on the balance sheet of Partnership
and, to be fair, vice versa as well. And we've looked at the way that things are accounted
for and overall I think I'd say we're comfortable. So that's the most important thing to say
straight away.
There are differences in accounting. Some of those are driven actually by the way that the
reinsurance contracts work on Partnership's side of the fence. And I think it's fair to say
until we get the integration process complete and understood, I won't be able to tell you
the balance of business that will continue to go through those reinsurance contracts, or if
indeed more will go through those reinsurance contracts.
But in essence what we're saying is that overall I don't expect any substantial change.
Certainly, our consensus we're comfortable with and I think David is comfortable with his
consensus at the moment.

A - Rodney Malcolm Cook

{BIO 14008420 <GO>}

Where's the microphone? You've got it? Barrie.

Q - Barrie Cornes

{BIO 2389115 <GO>}

– Cornes of Panmure Gordon. Just one question, then. In terms of IP, over the last few
years you've both been talking about your IP being better than the other company's IP.
What are you going to do with that? Are you going to try and merge the two IPs? And how
long will that take, or will you use one company rather than the other, please?

A - Rodney Malcolm Cook

{BIO 14008420 <GO>}

As I indicated, it is our intention to capture the full benefit. So from Just Retirement's
perspective, it's not like we're merging with a standard annuity writer who has a lot of
past data but no matching medical history attaching to it. Partnership has got a full
extensive medical history.
Page 14 of 23

And the other exciting thing for us is, as David said, they've got concluded cohorts of
business because of their 20 years of history. So, Barrie, it is our full intention. It will take a
short while of course, a year or so, but we intend to combine that together and further
enhance our PrognoSys system's risk selection accuracy.

FINAL

Andy. We'll give you another go in one second.

Q - Andrew J. Sinclair

{BIO 17749036 <GO>}

Hi. It's Andy Sinclair from BofA Merrill Lynch. I just wanted to ask really on the outlooks for
both DB and individual markets. I noticed, I think, this is the first time that both companies
have put DB ahead of individual when you were going through your slide packs. I just really
wanted to see if that does signal a change of outlook for both groups, with DB being your
main focus going forwards, and equally what sort of outlook you're seeing for the
individual annuity market with completions. Thanks.

A - Rodney Malcolm Cook

{BIO 14008420 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Right. So we have no interest in abandoning the individual market and, as we indicated,
we've invested heavily. We've also built a drawdown platform and we can offer customers
the best of both worlds, the combination of guaranteed income and a drawdown
proposition. The individual retirement income market, around £20 billion per annum, so
strategically we're well placed. We are a consumer champion. So we most definitely want
to stay in that market.
Andy, you're a bit too cunning for us. It was deliberate, I'm sorry to say. If we kept putting
DB second, you'd think that it was an afterthought. We did put it first, because very clearly,
we intend to be a more robust competitor and we believe strategically we can be. And
after all, it is 50% of our business, and perhaps that wasn't quite so much in your face as it
is now.

Q - Andrew J. Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

It's Andrew Crean at Autonomous. Could I ask who actually is going to raise the equity
capital, because that makes a lot of difference to our valuations? And also, given that
there is some concern over Solvency II, judging by the questions, could you tell us a little
bit about the combined Group's debt raising capacity in order potentially to bolster the
Solvency II position from that aspect?

A - Rodney Malcolm Cook

{BIO 14008420 <GO>}

David.

A - David Louis Richardson

{BIO 18045016 <GO>}

Sure. So first of all, on the equity raise, unfortunately I'm going to disappoint you there,
Andrew. We're not going to give further details on either the timing or the structure of the
equity raise today. And all we wanted to do is give people time to digest the transaction,
and then we'll come back to the market in due course with the details on that.

FINAL

With respect to Solvency II and debt capacity, and clearly Partnership raised £100 million of
Solvency II compliant debt in March this year. Just Retirement indicated back in February
that it was keeping its options open in that regard and those remain open today.
And where we decided it was the right thing to do, there was material capacity there,
because at the moment (00:48:01 – 00:48:06) so the capacity is material. And we don't
have a precise figure for that, because you need to know what the Solvency II numbers
are for that, but clearly it's material because at £100 million we weren't even getting close
to the limit on just the Partnership side.

A - Rodney Malcolm Cook

{BIO 14008420 <GO>}

And in terms of leverage? Well, it'll depend on the terms of leverage.

A - David Louis Richardson

{BIO 18045016 <GO>}

Yes. So to give you – yes, to give you context, we're talking about combined EV of about
£1.6 billion pre-capital raise, so you can apply whatever leverage ratio you think may be
sensible in the market to that. Currently, the financial leverage across the two groups is
probably just over 10%.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Rodney Malcolm Cook

{BIO 14008420 <GO>}

Importantly, as you might imagine, we did have calls yesterday with some of our largest
shareholders on both sides. They understand the strategic rationale and were positive. Of
course, they're all going away to consider it carefully, but they took on board comfortably
the fact that the £150 million will be raised and they expect us to communicate. As David
says, we want to communicate with prospective new shareholders and existing
shareholders.
Andy.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Andy Hughes, Macquarie again. I'm going to ask two because Andrew asked two. The first
one is the timing. I'm shocked by why you didn't wait until the internal models were
approved before doing this merger. Why do it now, when you have the uncertainty in both
cases of the outcome of Solvency II, as you've highlighted? Wouldn't it be much better to
leave it until you know the case of the models?
Second question, on expense synergies. £40 million, presumably no EV benefit because
this is all acquisition costs, and shouldn't you be cutting a lot more, because you don't
need the high level of acquisition costs? Presumably you only need one lot of acquisition
costs, where you've had two before, and the acquisition costs are not in the EV and
they're very material for both groups. So why are the expense synergies so small? Thank
you.

A - Rodney Malcolm Cook

Right. David?

FINAL

A - David Louis Richardson

{BIO 18045016 <GO>}

Yes. I'll take the Solvency II one. You take expense synergies. Yes. So, on Solvency II, we
don't think the tail should be wagging the dog here. And this is a strategically compelling
transaction. The timing was right for both Boards and both sets of shareholders to go for
the transaction. And I think, as we've set out today, both strategically and financially that
the rationale is there.
Both companies feel comfortable with where they are for Solvency II. That's just going to
be further strengthened by the equity raise of approximately £150 million. So we wouldn't
let that be a hurdle to get in the way of something so compelling.

A - Rodney Malcolm Cook

{BIO 14008420 <GO>}

Simon, the EV, because there will be some benefit.

A - Simon George Thomas

{BIO 15219564 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, there will. But just going back on the synergy side, it's interesting, we've had
feedback from other people who are shocked by the size of the synergies in terms of
they're so large. So it's interesting that you're suggesting they're too small.
But one thing I would say is that clearly our companies are very similar. There's no doubt
about that. Particularly because we're in the businesses of both the IUA and the DB and
they're our major business lines. And as part of this process, both David and I have been
through a cost center by cost center review to actually establish what we think is a realistic
synergy that we can get out of this business.
And David highlighted that it's going to be £40 million per annum as a synergy saving.
And just to be clear what we're saying here, we're committed to actually say that we're
going to be saving £40 million in the year 2018, so the third year of this business. If so by
the end of December 2018, we will have saved £40 million from the addressable cost
base.
Now, in terms of where those costs will be saved, and I think you might be aware that I
think Partnership, their typical cost base, about 90% of their costs are acquisition related
and about 10% back book. It's slightly different for our business. We're about 70%
acquisition and about 30% back book.
What I'd say to you is that in terms of the £40 million, you could probably apportion that
across on that blended rate, so it might be, say, 80% acquisition and 20% back book. So
that would probably give you a bit of a steer as to where we're thinking.

A - Rodney Malcolm Cook

{BIO 14008420 <GO>}

Page 17 of 23

But once we've convinced the chief actuary that our maintenance expenses and systems
rationalization are realistic, then he will be able to provide a reduction in those expenses
across the existing book and that will increase the embedded value.

FINAL

Oliver?

Q - Oliver G. Steel

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

Yes. It's Oliver Steel of Deutsche Bank. Two questions, if I may. First, the £60 million of
restructuring costs, why so high? I mean both individually when you were cutting costs and
in fact as you are cutting costs, the restructuring costs were actually quite low, so this just
seems to be quite a high ratio.
Secondly, whose systems? So not so much the pricing and underwriting system, but
whose back office systems will you be using, and do you have enough capacity for both
companies' back books?

A - Rodney Malcolm Cook

{BIO 14008420 <GO>}

Simon, the second one, which is I think fairly, easily, given the very substantial growth
we've put onto the systems. Comment on that?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Simon George Thomas

{BIO 15219564 <GO>}

On the system side, I think, Oliver, and clearly as part of the detailed integration planning
we'll be looking at that. We'll be looking to take the best of breed from a systems
perspective. I can't tell you at the moment as to which systems we're going to be using,
but it will be subject to detail implementation and integration planning.
On the £60 million, shall I pick that one up as well?

A - Rodney Malcolm Cook

{BIO 14008420 <GO>}

Yes, because we don't consider that the 150% is...

A - Simon George Thomas

{BIO 15219564 <GO>}

Not particularly, no. I think from a market perspective I think 150% of the annualized saving
isn't particularly high. And again, though, what I would say to you is I'm not sat here with a
complete breakdown of exactly what's in that £60 million. There are effectively areas
where we believe there will be costs, including, of course, the IT migration processes, the
changes we have to put in terms of the structure of the business, and unfortunately of
course there will be some redundancy costs going through there as well.

Q - Andrew J. Sinclair

{BIO 17749036 <GO>}

Andy Sinclair from BofA ML again. And you mentioned that you've got quite similar
businesses, but your Group capital targets for – the Board capital targets for the two
businesses are quite different. And I just wondered if you could talk about what might be

Page 18 of 23

the material differences between the calculations and likewise where you might be
coming out as a combined Group capital target.

A - Rodney Malcolm Cook

{BIO 14008420 <GO>}

FINAL

Just be quick on this, because I'd like to take some callers who are waiting.

A - David Louis Richardson

{BIO 18045016 <GO>}

Yes. And economic capital, as you know, Andy, is not a – it's not a universal and a uniform
standard applied across all companies in the industry, so unfortunately you're not always
comparing like for like. I think one of the things which the combined Group will need to
focus on once it is formed is setting those capital targets. It's going to be very important.
But I think naturally by the time of completion, which we expect to be December 2015,
there's going to be much more focus on Solvency II than economic capital measures.

A - Rodney Malcolm Cook

{BIO 14008420 <GO>}

f I could just ask whether there are callers on the line. I respect the fact that people
weren't able to be here at such short notice. They may have already dropped off for...

A - Rodney Malcolm Cook

{BIO 14008420 <GO>}

Q - Greig N. Paterson

{BIO 6587493 <GO>}

Just on the individual side, on the panels for the retail life phase, you're both on most
panels. Don't you get kicked off ? Isn't there some revenue dis-synergy there?

A - Rodney Malcolm Cook

{BIO 14008420 <GO>}

We don't believe that there are any material dis-synergies. In terms of our business
planning, we've allowed for some small potential downside on the individual market.
Importantly, being two new entrants and growing in the DB market, we actually see the
positive synergies there more than offsetting any small dis-synergy in the individual space.

Page 19 of 23

But I'd have to say, Greig, you've got two companies with five-star reputations in the IFA
market. We're on different panels, as it happens. So I believe that given our outstanding
service from each company, we can be retained on all of the panels that we're currently
on.

FINAL

Q - Andrew J. Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

It's Andrew Crean of Autonomous again. Can I take you back to Slide 7 and the projection
you've made of the bulk purchase annuity market, because I know when Partnership came
to market it was quite heavily reliant on a market forecast of sales, and particularly the
2015 forecasts there because certainly in the first half sales in bulk purchase are
significantly down. And Lane Clark & Peacock, who I think are the biggest players in this
market, are suggesting that actually sales will fall to about £8 billion or £9 billion this year.
So are you confident of that sales projection from the market?

A - Rodney Malcolm Cook

{BIO 14008420 <GO>}

It's a number of external bodies' views. It's only appropriate for us to represent the
supposed experts in the market. The critical issue for us is that we're going to take a
growing market share, and I'm happy to take an increased market share in a £10 billion
market, quite frankly. And forgive me, if it continues on that trajectory, we will continue to
grow with that.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Simon George Thomas

{BIO 15219564 <GO>}

I think, Andrew, in terms of the 2015 figures, though, I think certainly we're comfortable
that for the second half of this year we're expecting something around the run rate of
about £300 million, against what we originally for the first half of this year were
suggesting about £200 million. So in terms of pipeline, we've got a strong pipeline
coming through at the moment.

A - Rodney Malcolm Cook

{BIO 14008420 <GO>}

So just to remind everyone, Partnership have advised the market around £200 million for
the full year, and we're talking about an additional £300 million for July to December on
top of the numbers that you have in your pack.

Q - Fahad U. Changazi

{BIO 15216120 <GO>}

Good morning. It's Fahad Changazi from Nomura. Just a very quick question. In terms of
the combined Group's proportion of longevity risk transfer, could you remind us what it is
currently and whether you have flexibility to change that going forward, and for example,
utilizing more reinsurance for bulk annuities?

A - Rodney Malcolm Cook

{BIO 14008420 <GO>}

Just so that you're aware, Just Retirement has a treaty for bulk annuities with 55% risk
transfer. David, perhaps if you could just talk about the treaties?

A - David Louis Richardson

{BIO 18045016 <GO>}
Page 20 of 23



Company N ame: Just Group PL C
Company Ticker: JUST L N Equity
Date: 2015-08-11

FINAL

Yes. So on the Partnership side, roughly two-thirds of our in-force retirement business
longevity risk is reinsured currently. And on open treaties, we reinsure 50% on the
individual annuity side. On DB, we adopt more of a facultative approach, so there isn't an
open treaty that sweeps up all new DB business as it comes through. We do that on a
case by case or we bundle it up. So there's not a uniform percentage on that.

A - Rodney Malcolm Cook

{BIO 14008420 <GO>}

And so for us, as I indicated, 55% of DB risks are reinsured on a full risk transfer and in the
individual space 45%. So I think we'd take it as a compliment that L&G has decided to
follow our methodologies.
Andy.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Hi, guys. A question on what happens when you merge the two longevity bases.
Obviously, you have different views on different parts of the risk. I remember Just
Retirement wrote off a third of their VIF just before the IPO, because you have to reunderwrite the book. Is the potential that when you take on the Partnership business on
Just Retirement's basis, you have to take a very aggressive charge to the longevity
bases?

Bloomberg Transcript

And the second question I guess on the IP of Partnership. So we were always told that
Partnership had fantastic IP because of the data they've collected. I mean, have you guys
learnt anything about each other's respective market positions as a result of this process?

A - Rodney Malcolm Cook

{BIO 14008420 <GO>}

David?

A - David Louis Richardson

{BIO 18045016 <GO>}

Yes. In terms of IP, one area on due diligence where we do need to be careful on is, as it
were, opening the kimono on IP because of the competitive issues. So we have done due
diligence on each other's IP, but not on the same level of granularity as you would do on
everything else.
But what we've learned from that confirmed what we thought, which is that we actually
have very complementary IP datasets. And our heritage is very much in the more heavily
impaired end of the market. Just Retirement's is more in the lightly impaired and lifestyle
end of the market. And we've always said that consistently, that we've come from
different places.
We do overlap quite significantly in the middle. By putting the two IP datasets together
we'll actually fill the gaps, and that's why we think we'll have an outstanding IP dataset at
the end. It's not a question of one dataset overtaking the other. It is very much a question
of bringing the best together.

{BIO 14008420 <GO>}

FINAL

Right. Just so you know, and there are lawyers in the room, there are extremely strict rules
from the CMA in terms of two companies coming together at this point in time. We must
remain active competitors until the transaction's approved by both regulators and the
deal is concluded, and we do intend to actively compete.
And therefore, in terms of intimate intellectual property, we haven't exchanged that. But
critically, we are aware of each other's what we call A-over-E, the actual experience over
expected experience. And the two teams have got quite comfortable with how both are
performing on that critical measure.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

I guess the key thing that worries me is how fast you assume that wears off over time. I
mean...

A - Rodney Malcolm Cook

{BIO 14008420 <GO>}

How fast...

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

How fast are you seeing that wears off over time towards the population, i.e., the decline
in that mortality loading, which is I guess one of the reasons you had to re-underwrite your
business.

A - David Louis Richardson

{BIO 18045016 <GO>}

Well, yes. I think – so, for example, that's – and this is very much bringing together two
relative strengths, but one area where Partnership brings something to the table is we've
been doing this for 20 years. So as a result, we've got a number of underwriting years
that have been through that full run-off process, and so we actually have very strong
insight into that run-off pattern of that excess mortality. So that's something we can bring
to the combined Group.

A - Rodney Malcolm Cook

{BIO 14008420 <GO>}

Right. I think I need to bring proceedings to a conclusion. I don't want to get a rude call
from my old friend Mike Wells from Prudential to say that I held up all of the important
people for his meeting.
So a compelling proposition jointly from expense management and savings and also from
the strategic rationale for growth going forward. I commend it to you and thank you very
much for your attention today.
