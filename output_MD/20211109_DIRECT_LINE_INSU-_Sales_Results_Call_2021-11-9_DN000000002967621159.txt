Presentation
Operator
Hello, and welcome to the DLG Third Quarter Trading Update Conference Call. My name
is Juan, and I will be coordinating your call today. (Operator Instructions)
I will now hand over to our CEO, Penny James to begin. Please, Penny go ahead.

Penny James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Thanks, Juan. Good morning, everybody. Now, I'm sure you have all read through the
results and I'm conscious they're not that long. So, really this is about giving you a chance
to ask any questions.
Just for gathering your thoughts, what I thought I'd do is brieﬂy pull out a few key
headlines from the quarter for you. I think the -- I'd best summarize that is we continue to
do the right things and remain disciplined, while making good progress on the
transformation and positioning ourselves well as we look ahead.

So the ﬁrst thing I'd highlight is that despite challenging market conditions, we've
continued to grow own brand policies. So, we were really pleased to have maintained a
strong growth in both Commercial and Green Flag that we delivered through the ﬁrst half
of the year. In Home, as we expected, and I think highlighted at the half year, the market
has got more challenging in the second half. I'd say, whilst we continue to grow, the rate
of growth has slowed. And ﬁnally, Motor, our own brand policy count stabilized reﬂecting
our improved competitiveness as we began seeing some of the beneﬁts of our new
system coming through.
The second point I was going to make is that having been at COP26 last week, it would
be remiss of me not to mention the progress we're making on climate strategy, which is
one part of how we're positioning the business for the future. So, we've committed, as we
told you before, to the Race to Zero and we are working to set Science-Based Targets
covering Scopes 1, 2 and 3 emissions. But also I'm really clear that for all the talk of
commitments, which is important, we've also got to keep it simple for customers to go
green themselves.

Bloomberg Transcript

And that's why we are excited to launch our new electric vehicle proposition for Direct
Line. It makes the switch to electric easier for customers and builds on our already strong
position in the growing EV market. so alongside the beneﬁts that we're seeing coming
through from our new Motor platform, there's a real sense of momentum in the business
as we head into the New Year.
And the third point I was going to draw out is that we are on track for the full
implementation of the FCA's pricing practices review having successfully met the product
governance deadline in the third quarter. Now as with any large regulatory change, we
expect there to be volatility in the market in the ﬁrst few months of next year as the new
rules bat in. However, over the medium term, there will be no changes in the attributes
required to be successful in this market such as strong brands, great customer service,
and so on and so forth. So, we remain conﬁdent in our outlook.
So, summing up our transformation progress, delivery of new propositions and improved
competitiveness, combined with our focus on disciplined underwriting, means we're well
placed as we look ahead. And that's why we've reiterated our combined operating ratio
guidance of 93% to 95% over the medium term, normalized for weather, of course, and to
be between 90% and 92% in 2021.
Now just before I pass back to Juan to open the lines for Q&A, I just want to remind
everybody of our Investor Insight Session that we'll be holding our commercial business
on 17th November. As I've told you before, it's an area of our business that service through
its transformation and that's driven the strong growth that you've seen in today's results
and throughout this year. So we're really looking forward to giving you a bit more color
and insight as to how we've achieved it.
So I will pause there, and I will pass back to Juan to see whether you've got any questions
on the lines. Thank you.

Questions And Answers
Operator

FINAL

Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And our ﬁrst question comes from James Pearse from
Jeﬀeries. Please, James, your line is now open.

A - Penny James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Hi, James.

Q - James Pearse

{BIO 21233776 <GO>}

Yes, thanks. Hey, guys. Hey. I hope you're all well. Just two questions from me please. So
another strong quarter for Commercial. How sustainable are those, and those levels of
growth in that business going forward?
And then the second question is, can you give us an idea of the percentage point beneﬁt
the claims repair network gives you in terms of claims severity inﬂation? Or I guess put
another way, what is the diﬀerence between the level of severity on claims that go
through your garage network and severity inﬂation outside of your network? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Penny James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Yes, sure. So Commercial, I think the ﬁrst thing is what's driving the growth. And I think
there are probably three things underpinning that growth. The ﬁrst is that we've invested
in technology that's enabled us to really support customer service over the last few years.
So we won another award for kind of broker hub electronic hub last week. And you can
see both in the broker side and the customer side, the service levels and ﬂexibility that
people have is ahead of most of the markets. So that's the ﬁrst big win. And I think
alongside that that held up through COVID unlike some of the competitors. So that's
been a real advantage.
The second thing that's driving it is we've got pricing models in there, we've had Radar
Live in for some time, so ﬁrst part of the business that's done that, which has enabled us
to really start reﬁning the pricing in those areas and that in itself has given us beneﬁts
through this year as well, and it's driven some of that growth.
And the third thing is that the market has hardened throughout this year in commercial, to
some extent in the SME space, less than other parts of the market. But what that's meant is
kind of more business has been coming to market than usual. So when I look forward, I
think the momentum that drives the ﬁrst two of those continues. I think we'd expect to see
the market get more competitive again as it does in its sort of natural cycle as we move
into '22 and beyond. So what does that mean? So when we look at this business, we don't
see something that's probably growing at 15 -- 12%, 15% per annum as it has done this
year. We think that's probably a bit rich because it's had the additional tailwind of the
market. But we do see a business that can grow upper -- mid to upper single-digits going
forward on a continuing basis and that's how we view it. So we're pretty proud of what it's
done this year.

The second one on kind of the beneﬁt of network and severity inﬂation generally. I'll give
you a feel for what's happening in severity. I think the ﬁrst thing is, we know we have an
advantage because there is benchmarking done across the industry and so on, so we can
very literally see that. We don't give that detail out, James, because it's clearly very
commercially sensitive in terms of the points diﬀerential and so on. But to give you a
ﬂavor of what's going on in severity generally, I think we've been kind of -- I think we
ﬂagged at Q1, we're probably slightly above our usual 3% to 5% range. At Q2, we said it
was sort of coming in just inside. Broadly, it's running around somewhere at the top of
that 3% to 5% range and maybe slightly outside that if you include some of the real
COVID factors that are still having a little bit of eﬀect. So people driving premium cars, for
instance, cleaning costs, those sorts of things are still knocking around. But the biggest
driver at the moment, that's putting kind of upward pressure in there will be around, I
suspect, for a little while is second-hand car costs, where you've seen a big spike because
of consumer demand and lack of availability in the new car market. So I think we kind of
expect to see some continued inﬂation probably somewhere around the top-end of that
range as we have through this year, driven by that eﬀect and to see that for some months,
yes, I think.
What does having a network do for us in that, gyuys? Certainly we have been able to
manage some of those costs in a diﬀerent way. We've been able to be more ﬂexible in
certain areas, we've been ﬂex [ph] what we do on the repair side. So we know that there
are beneﬁts from having the repair networks that come through, especially when things
spike. But I can't give you the numbers for competitive reasons, I'm afraid.

Thank you. The next question comes from Greig Paterson from KBW. Please, Greig. Your
line is now open.

Q - Greig Paterson
Hello, everybody. Can you hear me?

A - Penny James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Hi, Greig. How are you?

Q - Greig Paterson
(inaudible) The -- two quick questions. One is, wonder in Home due to the FCA pricing
review, you've consistently said that you're moving renewal rates down in a steady way to
achieve the pricing rules by the ﬁrst of next year. I was wondering in percentage terms,
how much further you still need to go to achieve that on the renewal pricing?

And the second thing, in Commercial lines, in the third quarter, I was -- including NIG and
SME area (inaudible) business, what is the net rate that you are carrying year-on-year sort
of premium rate minus claims inﬂation? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Penny James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Brilliant. And thanks, Greig. So FCA pricing, and where are we? So I guess, and in
particular kind of focused on Home, well, ﬁrst thing to say is, we're on track because I
think that matters. Second thing is, we've delivered all the product fairness elements,
which I think is relevance to your question. And kind of we're set for year-end, if you like.

Bloomberg Transcript

What's happened on renewals? Now, we've said over the last three years that we've been
progressively tightening, setting margins in the book with which we're comfortable and
bringing those in, and we set those basically in the 5-year, 10-year points primarily. So as
we come into this year, we've been kind of dealing with those tails each year. We've done
a bit more today -- so a bit more over the course of this year, which we can sort of see in
the AVP numbers. So even though I think the AVP on Home overall is pretty ﬂat even
though we've been putting inﬂation through and as we go, and that's because we have a
side that is we've done a little more tightening in those margins at the end of 10-year [ph].
So when we actually put the sort of product fairness elements and the product
governance elements of the rules in September, we didn't make a step change for that
because we have been doing that incrementally over a number of years is perhaps best
indicator I can give you.
I think the remaining bit, therefore, where the pricing rules come in is, is the leveling up of
the 10 years and that's kind of the process that will happen in the early part of next year.
So perhaps that gives you a feel for what's happened in that space.
I think on Commercial --

Q - Greig Paterson
Sorry Penny. Is there going to be dramatic -- I'm just trying to -- is it something we need to
be shocked by or is it going to be fairly second order? That's what I'm trying to ﬁgure out.

A - Penny James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

I'm not going to make predictions. It's legal for me to price indicate, so I try it [ph] with a
little bit of caution. But if you look back to even the kind of the FCA original business case
and so on, you can see that there is a not insigniﬁcant correction in the numbers, in the
new business numbers in the Home book when they did that modeling. So I don't think
it's unreasonable if I got that modeling right to expect something. And I think the other
thing that people will have to think about is what's coming through in inﬂation and
inﬂation in Home has been running top-end of 3% to 5% and really with one eye on what's
happening, construction cost and so on, so actually, there is some inﬂation out there. So
I'm not sure it's about. The other thing I'd say is, it will vary, but from segment to segment,
brand to brand, channel to channel.

So when I say that we expect some volatility at the beginning of next year, I think people
will put their rates into the market on Day 1, and then that'll be a process. Remember, it
takes six weeks or so -- the renewal notices go out about six weeks ahead of renewal
dates, so there'll be will be some time before it's clear, what all eﬀects are on both new
business and renewals, and we -- you should expect, I think the market to make
adjustments as all those data points become clear. So I think we'll be and we've kind of
ﬂagging that there'll be volatility in Q1. And I wouldn't over read any particular direction,
you're seeing that for any particular player because I think that will all kind of even out
across that quarter, if that helps at all. I think the important thing when you stand back is
we have the levers we need, we've got experience in this market. We're comfortable with
our position in coming in, and we've been very careful in Home to take our volumes early
in the year before it got too competitive. We've backed oﬀ a little bit as things have got
competitive in the second half. So, we're very comfortable with where we're coming into
that process, and we've got the levers to deal with it and we will all see kind of what the
best route through the early weeks is when everybody's prices are in the market.
Sorry. You asked a question on Commercial as well, about rate carry. Yes, I don't think
we've given the rate carry numbers in here, but we are carrying ahead of inﬂation around
6 points something like that inﬂation running in the 3%, 4% somewhere around there.

Q - Greig Paterson
Thank you. Cheers.

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Thanks, Greig.

Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from Freya Kong from Bank of America. Please,
Freya, your line is now open.

Q - Freya Kong

{BIO 20097488 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. Two questions, please. So ﬁrstly, given that you've talked about
severity sort of getting worse since H1 driven by used car prices and market pricing
remaining quite stubborn, how comfortable are you in being able to price the severity
inﬂation going into next year?
And secondly, could you comment a bit more about the competitive dynamics that you're
seeing in Home? Given the slowdown in growth that we've seen in Q3, do you think this
will continue into 2022 or is it very dependent on the FCA trading volatility? Thanks.

A - Penny James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Brilliant. Hi, good morning, Freya. On Motor ﬁrst, I think the punch line is if you look at the
ABI data, the market is down about 7% year-on-year. For us, we're pretty ﬂat. So, what's
going on there? Well, the reality is that the market adjusted in January to lower frequency

Page 6 of 22



FINAL

Company Name: Direct Line Insurance Group PLC
Company Ticker: DLG LN Equity
Date: 2021-11-09

and that hasn't really risen since, and there's lots of good reasons. But that might be the
case, so whiplash and so on and so forth, that could be driving that. But however it got
there, it's kind of reduced for lower frequency, and hasn't really risen as a whole, the
variation within it, but as a whole. We've reduced the shallower amount and we've been
passing inﬂation through to your point, throughout the second half of the year. So, we lost
share in the ﬁrst half, because we've taken a shallower route and we started pricing
inﬂation towards the end of the ﬁrst half. But actually as we've come through the second
half, we've improved our competitiveness, if I could say the word, as we started to see the
pricing beneﬁts coming from the new platform launch. And so even though we've been
putting inﬂation through, we're still seeing beneﬁts, and that's why we've kind of
stabilized the policy counts regardless of putting inﬂation through. So, it's very clear that
our aim is to continue place pricing severity through, and we wait with curiosity to see
where the rest of the market -- when the rest of the market will stop pushing.

Bloomberg Transcript

And on Home, yes, you're right, the shape -- I mean, Home has done -- I'd like to say,
we've got a crystal ball, but that's not the case. But Home has done kind of exactly what
we predicted it would do. We -- it was -- it's been pretty ﬂat with relatively low inﬂation
and relatively low premium inﬂation for the last few years. And it kind of remains low at
start of the year. We pushed pretty hard and actually we have some, good [ph]
manufacturing beneﬁts coming through, strong claims management and so on, that
enabled us to grow and improve our loss ratio through the ﬁrst half, which is a magic you
always want to replicate.
Now as we moved into the second part -- second half, it's got more competitive. We think
by September again, it was something like 7% oﬀ year-on-year, the Home market. Now
our read on that and our -- what did we expect, because logically, long term customer
values increase in a post pricing practices world. So, our belief is that that is driven by
pricing practices and people's entry points into pricing practices trying to drive share as
we go into that. If that's the case then logically people will adjust that thinking as they get
into the post pricing practices world what they do -- what that does to price for them to
judge rather than us. But as I say, we are pretty comfortable on Home with where we're
coming in, the pricing practices to be able to kind of hold rate coming through and still
be holding the book ﬂat growing slightly after strong growth in the ﬁrst half feeling pretty
positive for that. Yes, I pulled [ph] that.

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

FINAL

Hi, Thomas. Good morning.

Q - Thomas Bateman

{BIO 21707516 <GO>}

Just on the Motor pricing, I think investors checking from the outside are seeing pricing
down 7%, claims inﬂation 5%, and there's a big kind of 12 point gap there. And I think
there's lots of moving parts in between, driving behavior, whiplash, new cars et cetera.
But I don't know, can you help us give us the numbers to bridge the gap as to why -- it's
not a 12-point gap for the rest of the market.
And the second question is just on the transformation changes, there's a lot of good talk
about improving accuracy in the pricing. But when do we -- should we expect to see sort
of the changes are -- actually travel for both Motor and Home or more material change in
the direction of travel policy count on both Motor and Home?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Penny James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Okay. Look the challenging tone of the second question, I will come back to that. Okay. I
mean, I can only do so much to tell you why other people are pricing, what they're
pricing, that's for them to tell you. But let me give you -- if I can ﬁll in some components, if
you like that might be the case. So, I think you're right that the answer lies between claims
frequency, severity and including whiplash and preparation for pricing practices, and any
other people can tell you how they're drawing those lines.
But what's happening on frequency, I think we said at half year driving miles are pretty
much up where they were pre-COVID and that's obviously continued. Frequency remains
below 2009 levels. For us, they're still trickling upwards. For us they're kind of close to still
approaching the pricing assumptions that we've been running with. So that's good. But it
is a critical assumption, so there may be some variation with a few points there in people's
positions, don't know. But broadly, there is a beneﬁt relative to 2019 levels at the moment.
In terms of severity, people are calling out -- sometimes we call out lower numbers than
competitors because I think what James asked, we have some beneﬁts from the repair
centers. But yes, you've got to say that it's been somewhere around the upper end of 3%
to 5% for the last couple of years, and those two years where the claims inﬂation haven't
been priced yet by the market, because they've been oﬀsetting them in some sense
against frequency beneﬁts. So you think you've got that plus whatever is ahead still to
come in some shape or form.
And then oﬀsetting that you've got whiplash few points depending on who you are and
whether you use the government numbers, very unclear at the moment what the beneﬁts
of -- it's just too early to know where the whiplash reform beneﬁts are going to land. So
again, you've got an assumption in the mix. So I think all of that kind of point you to the
Page 8 of 22

FINAL

market is 7% down, which means they really haven't priced a couple of years of inﬂation.
So if you take -- if you assume that it's logical because frequency is down, it's still -- there's
still a gap there, whether 5 or 10 or whatever will depend on some of those assumptions,
but there's clearly a gap.
So I think that's where the market really is and people may be making choices. I think as a
practical point with PPR [ph], that's the only other thing that I would sort of ﬂag, that if you
make a pricing change now, you've only got a few weeks beneﬁt from it. So, there comes
a point where you kind of apply most of your pricing resource to what could 2022 look
like rather than what 2021 look like. So, I'm not sure now, I'd be over-reading movements
in the back end of this year because just because the volume of resource that we'll be
focused on post '22 well than anything you do now has little validity or is only valid for a
few weeks. So, so sort of -- I think the story from here, it was not very exciting in 2021
whatever direction it goes and because most advantage is going on 2022. But a
shorthand answer to all of that is the market hasn't priced all of inﬂation. We've been
pricing inﬂation. We got more of the kit bags to come as we can kind of put resources
back on to delivering beneﬁts that's currently focused on getting us over the line for
pricing practices.
So we're feeling pretty positive actually as we go into next year, which leads us on to
transformation, which is your second question. So, what's -- kind of what are the beneﬁts
and so on. So I think why we got more competitive through this year, through the second
half, really because I think and I probably ﬂagged it way back when -- when you move
over to the new platform, before you even do anything with it, you gain some increase
sort of ﬁdelity in the pricing because you're no longer translating languages, pricing
languages into the deployment languages and so on. So you keep some granularity in
that, that you didn't before, and we always thought there'll be some beneﬁt attached to
that. So that's part of I think what's improving competitiveness.
We've also started the process of bringing in more external data sources. At this stage, it
will be bringing us up to some of the better players in the market rather than taking us
way ahead of anywhere. So we have a list that we are working through of model
improvements that are backed up behind that, which bring in other sources, new diﬀerent
-- use diﬀerent techniques and so on and so forth. At the moment, we are not putting
many of those through because we're focused on getting pricing practices safely over the
line. But those are sort of in the wings and building ready to go, which is why we're quite
optimistic about the deployment opportunities as we go through 2022. And then on top
of that, there are expense beneﬁts, which are attributable to platform, which come as the
book migrates over which will be over the next 12 to 18 months we'll build and really that's
around customer self-service levels. So it enables self-service in a way that we couldn't
have done on the previous platform. If I give you an example, so 100% of claims can be
done self-service, now probably around 20% or something like that. So, and there are
similar eﬀect on the sales and service side. So, it enables us to start evolving that as the
book goes over and migrate over. So that's the other area to look for over time. So feeling
pretty positive about the pricing position coming in relative to the markets and lots on the
kit bags come through yet from the transformation.

Hi, Penny. Good morning, Alex.

Q - Alex Evans

{BIO 22496014 <GO>}

Good morning, Penny. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to have a little bit
more color on when you say pricing in line with severity claims inﬂation, you're meaning
sort of across the total, but -- because when I look on a new business perspective at least,
it looks like pricing for Churchill is more in line with the market and you're essentially
saying pricing for the market is not taking into account inﬂation. So is it fair to assume that
you're sort of quite materially ahead in the Direct Line brand there?
And then, I just wondered if it's possible to give a bit of color of where the key drivers of
growth is coming in Motor at the moment? Is that sort of more Churchill based relative to
sort of the existing Direct Line?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Penny James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

I think you're right that it will vary because when I say that sort of portfolio levels, there will
be some variation underneath it. But philosophically, it's going in everywhere where we
make some trading choices around that as well. So it's going in on new business as well. I
think the key drivers of growth, certainly we have seen PCW come back faster than direct
as we've pulled out of the pandemic. I think there's all sorts of reasons for that and the
oﬀset is we've seen renewals on direct hold up really, really well and strengthen. So as a
book, probably not much story, but the new business story is deﬁnitely versus renewal
story has deﬁnitely kind of diﬀered between the two channels, I think is the essence of the
picture.
So yes, pricing going through everywhere, but we do make diﬀerent choices in diﬀerent
segments and diﬀerent channels. So it's diﬃcult to say it necessarily, and through this
year, PCW stronger than Direct on new business, but not so on renewals.

Q - Will Hardcastle

Hi, good morning, everyone. Quick question on home insurance actually, just thinking
about the inﬂation levels and whether these have changed at all as the year has gone on. I
think you mentioned you're running at the top end of 3% to 5% in Home as well. I guess,
do you have any procurement contracts that help to mitigate inﬂation risk here or would
you say you're equally exposed as to wider market, things like labor cost, material
inﬂation et cetera?

A - Penny James

{BIO 22230376 <GO>}

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Great question. So I think, look, we're somewhere around the upper zone there. I
wouldn't over read that. I think we get quite granular on whether it's 3% or 4%, it's
somewhere around the top. And I think over the course of the year, I think it's fair to say
that it's been pretty -- it's run ﬁne all the way through. We're still kind of -- it's running
pretty ﬁne inﬂation. We're conscious of though as we look at construction costs it's only a
relatively small part of the book, it's the ﬁrst thing to say. So a lot of Home claims are
jewelry and electrical goods and carpets and so on and so forth, and although we are
seeing supply chain glitches, in some of those places, this thing that's really changing that
you can't maneuver around for want of a better description that's changing the face of
things and lots of things cash -- are cash anyway. Really the drive -- the questionnaire is
more around sort of construction costs where clearly there is inﬂationary pressure across
the markets, not just in insurance. And our sense is that we've kept it tight through this
year and we've been able to manage it within that zone. But if that pressure keeps
building then there is kind of some inﬂationary pressure because we are not immune.
And in terms of contracts, you're right, we have contracts with suppliers that roll at certain
date. So, you do get some protection for a spell [ph] that may not be there forever, and I
suspect that's the same with other signiﬁcant players as well. So our sense is that there is a
kind of building pressure in the market that might lift oﬀ slightly and that we're kind of
monitoring that very closely, which is why I say we're sort of actually around the top of the
range, yes.

Q - Will Hardcastle

{BIO 22230376 <GO>}

That's really helpful. I guess just -- this is probably my naivete, but construction as a
percentage of Home claims, are we talking 10%, 20% by the sounds of what you're saying,
is it in that range?

A - Penny James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

It's in that, Will, and it's quite diﬃcult to peel apart because even within a -- even within a
claim it depends if you have an [ph]escape of water claim, it depends on what component
of that is, so it's not even as simple as escape of water claims we will be doing and so on
and so forth. But it will be that's fair rather than higher.

Thanks. Thank you very much. And two questions please. For the ﬁrst one -- good
morning, Penny. The ﬁrst one is on Motor mix. How has the mix been developing over the
last few months? And just looking forward into the FCA's reforms, is there any danger that
more established players or insurers like yourself could lose out on new and younger
drivers in the ﬁrst few months of the year if there's kind of continued competition?
And then my second question, which is slightly diﬀerent around [ph] the theme of today,
but how should we be thinking about investments and income guidance looking out over
the next couple of years in a rising yield environment?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Penny James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Brilliant. And I'm really excited because it means that Neil got a question. So just on mix, I
think the story on mix, it's really a COVID one rather than a pricing practices one at the
moment. So -- because you saw through 2020 -- want to my years right 2020 and into
2021, there were less new drivers coming into the markets. We saw sort of AVP do some
strange shapes through last year because of that and because of less new cars in the
market. Now, although that's correcting, but not corrected, I would say, so there is still
some mix shift in the market. I don't think our book is doing anything particularly drastic
compared to anybody else's in that regard or not consciously so. So I think that's probably
the story on mix still correcting if you like.
I think coming into next year, I don't know how -- I don't know that there is a particular
feature of what will happen to young drivers versus anything else. But certainly, I expect,
you will see people have more ﬂexibility of pricing in segments that they don't have large
back books in. So you may see some movement in that space or people creating subbrands or targeting the diﬀerent channels, or that's kind of what will happen. So I don't
think there is a clear outcome of automatically X, Y, and Z will happen. I still think the big
players have dominant forces in this market, so you may see some nimble players doing
speciﬁc things, don't know, but I wouldn't over-read at this stage what will happen to any
one particular player. I think we'll let it settle out, of course, in the next few months. Neil?

A - Neil Manser

{BIO 5571223 <GO>}

So I'll take investments and income. So thanks for the question. So, yes, so you pretty well
remember, we ticked up the investment income guidance for this year from 1.5% to 1.6%
at the half-year. If I look at what's happened since then you've clearly got rise in risk free
rates through to now, but you've seen a kind of a consistent slight tightening on credit as

FINAL

you go through the second half of the year. So net-net, I think I said at the half year, the
1.6% for this year is pretty much a good platform for next year.
If you look longer term, the impact of rates will start to feed through the book, but
obviously, we only -- the maturity proﬁle is that we are kind of reinvesting a third of the
portfolio each year. So it takes a while to work through the book. So I think underpin -- so I
think, the good thing it basically underpins where we are today. I think it needs to move a
bit further when we start to see credit markets moving to get a lot more upside.

Q - Ivan Bokhmat

{BIO 15378004 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi, good morning. I've got a couple of questions please. So the ﬁrst one is back to the
guidance and combined ratio. So for this year, you're talking about 90% to 95%, and if my
math is correct, that means that for the second half, you'll be at the top end of your midterm range or possibly slightly above it. So I was just wondering if you could maybe try to
outline the main drivers combined ratio to return back into the range for 2022, is it mainly
expenses? Do you have any particular assumptions on pricing, et cetera?
And the second question is actually on capital. So maybe also for Neil, maybe you could
give us an update on the capital generation second half. And just related to your
comments about ﬁrst quarter being very uncertain, do you think it will be appropriate to
expect to return to 160% solvency ratio with your capital distribution at the year-end?
Thanks.

A - Neil Manser

{BIO 5571223 <GO>}

Excellent. Thanks for the question. On the core, the simplest way to think through is the
90% to 92% with a 3-point beneﬁt versus the 93% to 95% is all down to Motor frequency
in the ﬁrst half. So, that was about -- when you size that's about 3-point kind of in a vertical
[ph] is one-oﬀ beneﬁt, that's what's ﬂowed through into the 90% to 92%. Clearly between
ﬁrst half and the second half, there's always a split between when reserve releases come
through and don't forget, in the ﬁrst half, there is no weather as well, although all these
numbers are normalized. So things in part [ph] is the one-oﬀ beneﬁts from low frequency
in the ﬁrst half. It shouldn't -- you shouldn't take anything from that guidance. They've
been consistent with the medium term 92% to 95%. That's the ﬁrst point.
And second point on capital, we -- as I said at the half-year, we're looking to move back
down to the mid of the range. So the 160% still a position today. Of course, any
uncertainty, we will generally take into account within the SCR for that type of risk rather

than within the range. But let's see when we get there, we'll be excited to. We're still
pretty conﬁdent on the capital position January [ph].

Maybe one follow up. Would you consider another buyback, if you're well above the
range?

A - Neil Manser

{BIO 5571223 <GO>}

So, of course, any decision we take on that will be done year-end. You know our track
record, which is, if we've got -- if we think we have excess capital, we have consistently
returned to shareholders. And I think given where we are today, we're buying back stock,
we think is a very attractive price in the marketplace.

Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for taking my call. Two questions please. First
question is around whiplash. What have you seen so far? I think, Pen, you had a comment
earlier saying it's still early days to see where it will land. So I'm just wondering whether
you could give some color on this and also when do you suppose this should settle at
some point? And second is on share buyback. And I think you've always commented on
you're buying back the share at quite attractive price, good ROE. But if I look at your
buyback program, which started on the 9th of March, your share price was GBP3.20, and
then if I look at the share price now, even at just the interim dividend, it just shows your
buyback hasn't really done anything to the share price. I mean, at the full year, would you
reconsider going back to the special dividend because that seems to be the preferred
way to income holders? Thank you.

A - Penny James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Whiplash, I mean, not much to add really. I think whilst -- so when it was eﬀective 31st of
May, I think whilst the industry was ready, I'm not sure that all these ﬁrst [ph] claims
management ﬁrms and so on had got their heads around the process. So we saw a sort of
slowdown through the summer while things work through the system, if you like. So I
think at this stage, nothing that meaningfully, we would ﬂag out. And we'll give a little bit
more color at year-end, by hopefully which time, it will be clear on what's happening,
whether there are any trends of note in that.

And on the share buyback, this special dividend question, I guess we're open minded.
We don't have a kind of we have to do one or the other. We look at the position at the
time with the evidence we've got. At the moment we think a buyback is the best
approach. I'm not sure that either necessarily will be driving the share price today. And
the return of capital is a long-term game. We're returning capital because it's the right
thing to do to create value in the long term. So I'm not sure it's necessarily such a driver of
short-term share price, of course.

Good morning. Hi, Gordon. Are you there?

Q - Gordon Aitken

{BIO 3846728 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hey, Penny. How are you doing? Yeah, so couple of questions please. First, what do you
think happens to the price comparison channel post January 1, 2022, and maybe you can
talk about next year, but also talk about over the medium term, given that it's going to
take customers a while to change what they do?
And also another question on the pricing review. From what you've said, my sense is that
you think you've repriced your back book, probably maybe to a slightly greater extent
than others, if you can say if that's right. And if it is, do you then need to -- or the beauty of
it, you don't need to raise new business rates as fast as others. So is this an opportunity to
either gain share or to gain margin? Thanks.

A - Penny James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Thanks, Gordon. So PCW, I think perhaps the way -- if the FCA achieved what they set out
to do, it will reduce the amount of movement in the market. So in that sense, you may -you would -- actually, some of the things that you are seeing in the market now around
Home pricing and people trying to take share, and so would again suggest that customer
-- people believe that customers will stay around for longer in this set of scenarios, in
which case, you would see less volume moving logically through -- well, any acquisition
channel, including the PCW. So that said, I think there are many things that drive people
to move insurance products, service, changes in lifestyle and so on and so forth, so I think
there's still plenty of ammunition left in the PCW channel as well. So it's not the only thing
driving it. That's probably the position on PCW.
In terms of pricing review, I'm not going to predict or tell you what I think our pricing will
do versus other people's. But we have, yes, taken the action that we think we need to take

Page 15 of 22



FINAL

on the tail, so we are not coming into 1st of January, trying to make those adjustments.
Those have already kind of gone through the book, if you like. I would imagine that others
with large books have been making moves as well, but that's a question for them rather
than for me. I would say that a lot of those players sit around the ABI table, which had
long before pricing practices came onto the horizon had set themselves some guidance
as to how it addresses. So I'd be pretty conﬁdent that people have been moving that
books. You'd have to ask them how fast and to what degree. So you're right that 1st of
January is much more about leveling up pricing in the early 10 years of then kind of
dealing with any tail issues. So that's where the focus will be. I don't have a crystal ball as
to where others sit in that path, so whether our movements will diﬀer from theirs and to
what degree.

Good morning. Just on frequency, I think lots of comments about the 2021 experience.
Just interested to get your take on how much of the frequency improvement is actually
sustainable. People are using cars in diﬀerent ways, diﬀerent times of the day. Do you
think we're going to remain below 2019 levels? If so, how much?
And then kind of same theme of claims inﬂation, are you seeing any trends to kind of
repairing cars rather than titling them, and hence putting more people through your
garage networks, but then maybe that is leading to a bit more of a backlog because then
you have to ﬁx the cars and that might be aﬀecting that promoter scores. Just any
comments around that might help.
And then secondly, lots of commentary again around FCA reforms and pricing practice.
Interested to get your take around the duty of care, which I believe has led us a timeline
now from Parliament seeking to get your thoughts around add-ons and any other things
we should be considering around that. Thank you.

I love that. I'm sure that's three questions than two. So frequency, I think we said -- I think
we said at half year and is still the case that driving miles deﬁnitely back up to prepandemic levels. Frequency, still below, and I think we are assuming that it remains below.
I won't give you the exact number. But why are we assuming that? Because when we look
at -- the diﬀerent kind of mileage is largely commuter traﬃc changing shape. And when
we look at our business and other businesses, we think the mix model ways of working
and so on will continue in some shape or form. That thing is diﬃcult to predict is exactly
what -- where that point will end up. So that could use still judgments in that. But that
movement, although still increasing, is kind of -- the frequency levels, although increasing,
are kind of trickling up rather than having stock moving or shooting up. So it feels as
though we're starting to move into the sort of endpoint territory, so -- and that will be a
little below what it was in 2019. But you're still susceptible to increase -- lockdowns or
actually on the other side, increasing conﬁdence over time. But when we look at -- when
we look at this from an operational perspective rather than a frequency perspective, and
we look to our people, there really is a move to hold on to a sort of mix model way of
working and I think lots of businesses are seeing at that. So I think it's reasonable to
assume that there is a structural long-term beneﬁt there. The exact amount to that, we will
all zero in on over time. So I think that claims frequency.
The second part of the question was the severity, yes, so it was around what are we doing
in the repair centers and what opportunities and what risks are there. So you know, there's
a number of factors kind of evolved in a kind of the severity question. So supply chains,
for instance, we're seeing bits and pieces, sometimes there are delivery issue, sometimes
there are particular parts issues. All of them at the moment seem to be kind of
smoothable out rather than crisis levels, if you like, rather than creating real constraint with
the exception of the one, which is second-hand car prices. You're right that we can ﬂex in
the repair centers, especially with frequency down. So there are some -- like everywhere,
there are skill shortages at the moment. You're seeing that across pretty much every
industry. So there is some of that happening in the repair network beyond that, not just
ours. But actually, with the frequency levels that they are, we're able to do a greater
proportion in house and so that gives us a beneﬁt overall. So I think it's fair to say that
having a repair network is an advantage, especially when severity is spiking, especially
when it's spiking for the reasons it is. So certainly the case. What all that works out to in
terms of our inﬂation relative to others? Too early to tell. So we would say we're at the top
end of the range, somewhere around there, and (inaudible) what they're seeing
separately.
And the third question was duty of care question. So it's a completely diﬀerent, I think
duty of care, so a few things I rounded [ph] on the call maybe it's close to a few, but -- so,
yes, deﬁnitely the FCA will do something to bring a duty of care or something of that,
make sure legislation requires them to do so I think over the course of next year, next
summer, I think. When you talk to the FCA how do they think about it, they think about it
as they consider NGI that they have done a lot of things that they want to do. So they say,
duty of care raising the bar across all kinds of areas of ﬁnancial services. So the fact that
they've done pricing practices, vulnerable customers and in our industry and they've
done IDT before that on the distribution side that kind of saying or literally saying actually
we think we've covered the bases in GI. So until you see the detail and then due to
consulting [ph] until December, no one will know exactly what that means. But I'm
conﬁdent that it's not aimed at TI, if you like, and I'm conﬁdent that we'll be less impacted
Page 17 of 22



Company Name: Direct Line Insurance Group PLC

Date: 2021-11-09

than some other industry areas and we'll wait and see. I've got a long way to go before
we know what the exact path that is.

FINAL

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Okay, that's very helpful, Penny. Just one point of clariﬁcation. Are you -- because of the
price of second-hand cars, are you repairing them more than you are pricing them oﬀ,
and is that not that -- it's not leading to any backlog in your repair networks?

A - Penny James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

So you did ask that question, and I forgot to answer it. So we will be. It will change the

Good morning.

Q - Faizan Lakhani

{BIO 20034558 <GO>}

I just had a few questions. Could you potentially look to run-oﬀ your most proﬁtable
distribution channels to maintain the margins on your back book? That was question one.
Question two, if you chose to further that inﬂation in household, some commentators
have pointed to a beneﬁt from COVID from lower levels of burglaries and being more
aware at home, could you potentially quantify what beneﬁt if any, you had from COVID
over the past nine months?
And the ﬁnal one is a small question. Could you provide a split between the businesses
that are in the short tenure versus with the tail that you've already dealt with? Thank you.

A - Penny James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

I didn't quite catch the last one. But let me just start the ﬁrst. Run-oﬀ is an extreme work,
so not planning to put any parts of the business into run-oﬀ, if that's the question. I think
the real essence of this is, when we look at our book segment by segment, cohort by
cohort, we can make choices about where we hold prices and in areas where it's sensible
to do so, we will seek to -- we will make the choice basically to protect shareholder value
within the bounds of being comfortable that it delivers fair outcomes for customers. As I
said, we've already been through the latter question, so our focus will be on what delivers
Page 18 of 22

FINAL

the most value for shareholders and we will dial in and out of segments with diﬀerent
brands and diﬀerent channels as appropriate, to get that. But you know -- but we're not
putting any parts of the book into run-oﬀ.
Inﬂation in Home, I think was the second one, where broadly what -- I think it's all very
muted now, and pretty much back to COVID levels. There are some mix diﬀerential. So,
you're getting, (inaudible) costs are lower, because people identify them faster, largely
because they're in the homes. We possibly think some increase in things like drains, which
might be the key with the number of houses having surveys, because the housing market
has been more buoyancy, we're seeing more claims on things like sort of damage in the
home because there are more people in there. So mix shifting overall pretty much dialing
where it was pre-COVID.
And I didn't catch all of the cheeky third question.

Q - Faizan Lakhani

{BIO 20034558 <GO>}

You mentioned that you've done a lot of work around the tail in terms of sorting out the
issues regards to the FCA pricing review and there is still some work to be done on the
short of 10 years, that will probably happen in in January. Could you potentially provide a
split in terms of what you categorize as tail and actually what's tail in your back book,
roughly a percentage?

A - Penny James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

No, the way we think about it is over a ﬁve-year, 10-year, we check every customer policy
price so that's way we think about it. So, I don't think it's really -- I don't have the number,
but I don't, -- because I don't think it's relevant to say if X% or Y%. It's more the path every

Morning, a couple of questions from me. First of all, just a follow-up from the answer to
Gordon's question. If the FCA is successful in increasing retentions, lowering churn, how
does that change your kind of view on -- your view of marketing? How much money you
spend marketing, which is kind of the acquisition cost for the Direct Line brand going into
next year?
And then the second question on your EV proposition. I wonder if you can give some
more color on what you're doing there? And what -- is your market share of the EV new
business, higher than the overall business? And what kind of advantage does your claims
network give you in the EV given you spend a lot of money training people to ﬁx these
vehicles? Thanks.

A - Penny James

{BIO 15157212 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Brilliant. So I'm not going to give you a direct answer on marketing or what we're going to
do on marketing, because that's in the competitive side now, Alan. But I'll say this, over
time, the way we think about the amount of marketing spend that we do is linked to the
amount of value that we see in customers. So we will -- as we see what customer behavior
does through there and what retention levels do we will reassess the overall long-term
value equation for each customer and that will set the parameters on the acquisition costs
we're prepared to pay. So, it kind of works the other way round. So, we do have a view as
to what we'll do on Day 1, but really it's much less important than overriding point that it
will ﬂex over time, dependent on how that -- how customer behavior settles in the new
market.
EV, yes fantastic. So we believe there are [ph] published market share numbers on EV
segment, so proving something is diﬀerent, but we believe we punch beyond our weight
in terms of share, partly because the customer introduction -- to introduce the
relationships with someone that we have and we traditionally have done, and we've got
good insights because for some years, we've been doing that. And so that's given us
insight on repair around EVs over a number of years.
What are we doing for customers? So obviously, we're oﬀering an insurance product, but
we're also oﬀering a package of things around that to help customers make the transition,
including access to various charging network, discounts on that, help with getting
subsidies, education online to diﬀerent cars ranges, diﬀerent attributes, so we've teamed
up with it with a startup called Electrifying who do a lot of that research content and are
super engaging around that, access to people to come and set up charging points when
you drive and so on and so forth. So the full kind of package of things that an individual
customer will have to go through to move to an EV and the aim is just to make it in line
with the brand as easy as we can for people to make that transition. So that's really kind of
the aim. We continue, as you say, to invest in the training of our mechanics and our
engineers to get them all EV. And it's not just EV, it's actually a lot of the technology that
goes in cars, modern cars around that as well so that we can be leading edge. And as
time moves on and our pricing capabilities improve, then we'll seek to bring those. Today,
there's not much ability for us to use that knowledge in our pricing. But at the time, we
see that as a real opportunity as well. So there's a package of reasons why we think we
Page 20 of 22



Company Name: Direct Line Insurance Group PLC

kind of have the right to be successful in EV building on our start that we already have.
And this proposition for customers is one piece of that tick [ph]

Yeah. Thank you. I would thank you. Wow. Well so questions of 1.5 times release, but look,
I'd just leave you with, I think we feel well positioned in the markets at the moment, we're
on track for pricing practices with positive about how we position both in the mark to
market given its challenges and in Home coming into PPR and we know we've got a
number of levers up partly, some of which you are already aware of and some of the
transformation will bring us beyond that. So, we feel positive about how we're set as we
look ahead. And the ﬁnal thing I will do is a plug, for November 17, for anyone who wants
to understand a little bit more about our commercial business and what's been driving
the growth there. But other than that I should stop there and thank you all for joining us.
Have a good day.

Operator
This concludes today's call. Thank you so much for joining. You may now disconnect your
lines. And enjoy the rest of your day.
