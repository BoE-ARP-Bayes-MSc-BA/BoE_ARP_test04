MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, good morning or good afternoon. Welcome to the Conference
Call on the Results for Three Months to March 31, 2016. I am Cher, the Chorus Call
operator. I would like to remind you that all participants would be in listen-only mode and
the conference is being recorded. After the presentation, there will be a Q&A session. The
conference must not be recorded for publication or broadcast.
At this time, it's my pleasure to hand over to Mr. Gianni Vitale, Senior Investor Relations
Oﬃcer. Please go ahead, sir.

Gianni Vitale

{BIO 19816633 <GO>}

Good morning and good afternoon, and welcome to Zurich Insurance Group's Q1 results

Mario Greco

{BIO 1754408 <GO>}

Thank you, Gianni. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us. And
I'm here, as you expect, with George Quinn, our Group CFO. And before we start
answering your questions, I'd like to have a few words about my priorities for the
remainder of the year.
As you know, while I work with Zurich, in the past, I started as CEO in the March. My ﬁrst
priority has been to develop a deeper understanding of challenges and opportunities for
the company and to identify the best way forward to help it achieve its full potential.

Bloomberg Transcript

This is an ongoing process involving discussions with key business leaders, with
employees, with brokers, with customers. What I can say today is that the group is
fundamentally sound, reserves are adequate, capital is strong and the brand is very
strong. That gives us a very strong foundation on which to build over the next months and
years. My second priority has been to build conﬁdence in Zurich. Conﬁdence is vital to
our success. It can only be achieved through transparency, through clear communication,
and by delivering on the group's strategic objectives.
Today, (02:22) step in the right direction and they provide early evidence that the
measures that we started last year are improving the performance of General Insurance
and also the continued progress in Global Life and in Farmers is visible and is supporting
the group results.
We expect to see further improvements during the year particularly in the second half.
And our capital position, as I said, is very strong still today. My third priority is to position
Zurich for the future. It begins with shaping a clear and simple group strategy for the next
years and a strategy that would diﬀerentiate us among our competitors in the eyes of the
customers.
As you know, we will present this strategy to you at our Investor Day on November 2017.
Until then, we will continue to provide you with as much transparency as we can into the
ongoing execution of our strategy and, of course, we will take measures between today
and November.
Thank you very much for listening and now, over to you, and George and I will be glad to
answer your questions.

We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The ﬁrst question is from Dhruv
Gahlaut, HSBC. Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Dhruv Gahlaut

{BIO 16209870 <GO>}

Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Firstly, in terms of PYD, you've had
a favorable result this quarter. Still, I think there was a negative movement in the
international and the other business. Could you give us further details where this is
coming from?
Secondly, in terms of real cost I saw (4:23) you're expecting $500 million odd this year.
Any changes to the overall number of $1 billion or are we still shooting for that this year?
Thanks.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thanks, Dhruv. It's George. So, ﬁrst of all, on the PYD. I mean, you're right. The overall and
paying for the quarter is 1.5% positive. With the negative impact, I mean I think, because
the way we've added together, appears to be an IM, but it's not. It's actually in the Group
piece of the reserve development.

Bloomberg Transcript

And actually, what's happened there is the original – the initial proposals from the units
was actually for a stronger PYD outcome, and we decided to strengthen other reserves
elsewhere for the Group recomponents (5:06) in the quarter. So I mean that's why you
see that negative impact in the chart in the appendix.
On the reorganization, I mean, the guidance that we gave at the full year around cost for
this year and next year, we haven't changed. The process continues. Under Mario's
leadership, we're looking at gain, eﬃciency and expenses. I mean it's an increased focus
area for us. We've made the comment several times today (5:29) being competitive,
being more eﬃcient and in fact, creating more room to invest for the future is absolutely
crucial for us. So there's no change to the guidance that we gave on the amount for the
claiming at this point (05:43)

Q - Dhruv Gahlaut

{BIO 16209870 <GO>}

Sorry. Can I just follow up on the ﬁrst point? So, are you guys saying that it's more of
cautious approach in terms of the way you've added reserve this time and it could actually
be that you – that this could get released in a few quarters?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

I mean, it's a small number, I wouldn't (06:06)

The next question is from Nadine van der Meulen, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.

Q - Nadine van der Meulen

{BIO 15200446 <GO>}

Yes. Hi. Good afternoon. Brief question. First of all, can you give a general comment on
the reserve positions? Are you comfortable with the reserve levels in both the U.S. and
Europe? And perhaps you can comment on that in a bit more detail?
And secondly, the Z-ECM quarter to-date, if you could provide update on that? And if not,
I believe – sorry that was I think 110%, and on top line, so premiums and life sales were
down, can you comment on top line pressure going forward? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

First one. Just (7:03) comment on reserve position on Europe and EMEA – I mean, we
have – sorry, Europe and the U.S. and we're comfortable with the reserving position on
both. They both contribute relatively modest positives to the overall positive PYD you've
seen for the quarter. I think most of the discussions we've had so far or we've had was
probably focused on the U.S. position, and maybe just a couple of quick comments on
that. I mean if you look at our U.S. book, I mean we have reasonably large proportion of
liability which is not uncommon for a big market commercial player. But then we have
workers' comp, auto liability, and general liability. If you look at the issues we've faced last
year, we've been focused on the auto liability line. If you look at the other components of
the book, but actually performed very strongly for us over a fairly long period now.
If you look at our workers' comp book in particular, which is about 25% of the book by
written premium. I mean we believe if we do a peer comparison for, I mean, for example,
IBNR as a percentage of the incurred or (8:13) 10-year to ultimate ratios, but generally
more conservative than the peer group. And, in fact, if we move to peer group or even
industry levels of reserving that would imply a reasonably signiﬁcant release from (08:29)
for the U.S. So overall, I mean, we feel comfortable with the reserve position that we have
for the group and for our major units.
On Z-ECM, I don't have updates for the quarter. And again, we've given a ﬁgure for the
quarter-end of midpoint range. That compared to the ﬁgure that we had at the end of the
year of 121%. It's come down with a combination of the on-boarding of the completion of
the RCIA acquisition and the impact of ﬁnancial markets in Q1. And that's principally
Page 4 of 23



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG
Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2016-05-12

interest rates rather than equity markets, so spreads. If I look at interest rates, I mean the
curve hasn't changed much since the end of the quarter. So I'd be surprised that had
been a signiﬁcant move. On top line, I think your comment was Life, is that right, or was it
GI?

FINAL

Q - Nadine van der Meulen

{BIO 15200446 <GO>}

On both. Well, on GI, I suppose it's as expected that those premiums are coming down,
but, yeah, on Life then particularly yeah.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yeah. Okay. Just one comment on GI. I think as you pointed out, I think we're just about
exactly where we guided people to expect this to be. I mean given the focus that we have
on proﬁtability for GI, is inevitable. But given the portfolio adjustments we're making that
we would give up, some of the lower-performing parts of the portfolio. And we'd expect it
to see a roughly mid-single-digit decline in premium volume. And that's what we have
today.

Bloomberg Transcript

On GL, I mean GL is a bit harder to judge. I mean EPE (10:02) is a relatively blunt measure
of volume. We can easily be impacted by the timing of some of the (10:10) larger CLP's or
the Corporate Life & Pension's transactions. From a new business value perspective, I
mean, year started very well both from mix and from model change, and I mean we don't
see an issue on the top line.
If you break up into the various parts and then we see strong performance in Latin
America, the joint venture has grown it. Local currency 29% in the quarter. I mean that
won't continue, but it's a very strong result. I mean and in general, we have small oﬀsets
elsewhere in the portfolio. But I mean the growth outlook for us, we expect to see growth
from the Life business through the course of the year. Mario?

A - Mario Greco

{BIO 1754408 <GO>}

Thank you. Can I add a comment – this is Mario speaking. Can I add the comment on
growth especially in GI? I think one of the most important corrections that were taken at
the end of last year then fully supportive that was abandoning the strategy called (11:11)
which was a growth strategy. And go back to the older principle of underwriting discipline
and underwriting focus.
And so you underwrite for proﬁt, you don't underwrite for size, for premiums, this is what
we're doing. And from that side, we will keep on doing that and the growth will just be a
consequence of it and if it is negative beat (11:38) And there is no way in which we can
solve an expense ratio issue by growing the size.
And if expense ratio worsens, we would take more actions on costs, but we will not
derogated (11:54) to underwriting discipline.

FINAL

The next question is from Paul De'Ath, RBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Paul De'Ath
Yeah. Hi there. And just – ﬁrst question is really a follow-up of I think Mario's comment.
And on the expense ratio and the correlation to the, I guess, expense eﬃciency programs
that you are running at the moment and previously you've guided to the fact that the
expense ratio should kind of remain ﬂat despite the cost coming down because of the top
line also shrinking, is that still the best way to think about it going forward, eﬀectively
(12:42) going to keep that expense ratio the level is at the moment? And that's the ﬁrst
question.
And then, secondly was just a question on Farmers and Farmers Re. Can you just remind
me the current state of play in terms of the Quota Share and position. I think, it's been
coming down recently, is it – is there a scope for it to come down further or are you now at
point where there isn't going to move around too much going forward? Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So, on the eﬃciency program. First of all, Paul. So the guidance that we gave was for this
year. So the expectation was that given the combination of the cost cuts that we are
making and allow the (13:29) impact on the top line, you see the expense ratio year-overyear be broadly ﬂat. That shouldn't be taken as a sign of the ambition that the Group has
for the cost ratio. I mean we'll have to come down further for us to be competitive, but the
guidance was really for 2016.
On Farmers, so the Quota Share as you pointed has come down signiﬁcantly in the course
of last two years. The old one is Quota Share, I think has come down from something like
18% and 14% to 10% last year, to 8% this year, I think we've been relatively clear that from a
longer term perspective we don't intend to be a reinsurer over time depending on the
exchanges needs and the ways in which we can support them. I mean lately that number
comes down further.
I mean one additional point. There was also an Auto Physical Damage treaty in place, also
Quota Share. Now it's entirely terminated at the end of last year. I mean that's one of the
things that obviously help us avoid some of the more negative impacts of the Texas hail
storms on the exchanges in Q1.

Q - Paul De'Ath
Excellent. Thank you.

The next question is from James Shuck, UBS. Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. I had two questions for you, please.
Firstly, on the General Insurance investment income in the quarter. It was about 8%
quarter-on-quarter I think in the note you referred to the inﬂation linked bonds in Latin
America, which is driving that. Can you shed a little bit more light on what's happening to
the running yield and what your expectation is for investment income going forward? I'm
surprised that LatAm inﬂation-linked bonds is a material contributor to total Group
General Insurance investment income.
Secondly, Mario just interested to get your thoughts around the organizational structure
of the Group. It strikes me that, at a Group level, you have the reporting, which is along
the lines of Global Life and GI whereas at the country level the individual units are around
very much at a country level. And there may be some disjointing features as a result of
that. So just interested to get your views on that. And just very quickly, if you're able to
shed any light on – if you have any exposure to the Canadian ﬁres, please, that'd be
helpful.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Okay. So, James, I'll start with the ﬁrst one. So you're right, I mean, ordinarily you wouldn't
see the Latin American business of a signiﬁcant impact, given the size of interest rates
there and the inﬂation moves, it does pick up a bit in Q1. Maybe to give you a sense of the
overall, which I think is more meaningful. I mean, the overall accounting yield for GI is
slightly over 2.6% in Q1. And that's slight up, I mean, very slightly up from the full year last
year. And the turnover is roughly at 2.2%. So, again, we have about a 40-basis point gap
between the book and the new money yield in GI currently. So, if things stay, we will see
some further erosion on the GI (16:46).

A - Mario Greco

{BIO 1754408 <GO>}

Yeah. On your question – this is Mario. On your question on organization, of course, I'm
looking at that and Zurich is world famous for a complex organization for having the
metrics triple or even four layers of metrics. So I'm concerned about that, I'm looking into
it and I am also discussing with the board and with the colleagues ways to simplify and
streamline the organization. But when we will have a decision taken, of course, we will
communicate and you will know it. But I deﬁnitely have in mind that the organization is to
be simple and has to promote accountability and the ownership of events.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

On the wildﬁre topic, James, I mean, I don't have something for you today. Obviously, it's
a too early stage here for us to have enough information from either reported claims or
even, given the limited or, in fact, no access to the area for us to survey and reach a
conclusion. Certainly at this point, I don't have something I can share with you on the
Canadian wildﬁres.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Could you just remind me what your market share is in Canada and I presume you have a
$275 million retention, is that right?

FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yeah. So the global cat program kicks in at $275 million. I mean obviously, we have more
reinsurance beneath that, you know depending on the size of the individual per risk
events can kick in and attach. I think for commercial, I mean our share, overall, is about 4%
for Canada. So relatively modest.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Thank you very much.

The next question is from Thomas Seidl, Bernstein. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you. First question on reserves again. I hear you are feeling conﬁdent on the
U.S. reserve, particularly workers' comp and when you look at the U.S. reserve triangles,
now half of your vintages are trending upward, so they show a negative development in
other workers' comp in particular, the recent years show a much more negative
development in the market. So I wonder what data you could or other evidence you could
give us to join you in the comfort about the U.S. reserve side. That's the ﬁrst question.
The second question, you had a rate increase of 2.5% across the portfolio in exchange for
the 5% drop in top line. How does this compare to claims inﬂation? How is net beneﬁt you
see from this rate change? And the third question, expenses admin seems to be fairly
stable, however, commissions trending. Is this something you expect to continue or are
we stopping at the 14.7% we are right now?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So I'll start with the U.S. reserve topic. So I guess to begin with, everyone is very familiar
with what we reported last year. And from a reserve perspective, I guess that's almost
entirely a U.S. issue. If you look at the two key things, commercial auto and the
construction that we talked about before, I mean, they're the two largest drivers.
Secondary impact is a small – relatively small sub-line of workers' comp which is the
Defense Base Act business that we exited in 2014.
I think if you look at workers' comp in particular, and even with DBA, the Defense Based
Act business and we have positive run oﬀ on workers' comp. I'll repeat the comments, I
think, I made in response to Nadine's question earlier. I mean, we have gone back to
study how we compare the industry in general, particularly on workers' comp, with
particular reference to the quality of the book, the mix of business that we have. So for
example, the extent to which we're rating guaranteed cost versus high deductible, the
Page 8 of 23



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG
Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2016-05-12

FINAL

extent to which paid claims would give (20:41) you anything about the quality of what we
rate versus the peers and then looking at the actual reserving position, both from an IBNR
standpoint and particular from, as I mentioned earlier, 10 years ultimate yield factor.
I mean, what that reveals to us would be the following. One is that the mix of business
guaranteed cost versus high deductible is not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent to the peer group.
Our pays are not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent to the peer group, but we are more highly
reserved.
So if you use that measure of IBNR or you look at those deal (21:18) factors and, in fact,
again, if we were to change the deal (21:22) factor or adjust the IBNR policy to one that
was either in line with the peer group or in line with the industry overall that would imply a
signiﬁcant release in reserves for workers' comp. Now, obviously, we're not proposing
that. We believe that the reserve position that we hold is appropriate given the risks that
we run. But, I mean, I think fundamentally, Thomas, our view of this is diﬀerent from yours.

Bloomberg Transcript

On rate increase, I think, we try to give a bit more information in the quarter. I mean, more
than just about the rate increase that we've beneﬁted from, but also, a sense of how that
rate increase impacts the diﬀerent tiers of our business. And of course, that's a very
important indicator from a forward-looking perspective.
And you see in there that – you see a combination of rate increase by diﬀerent tiers and
you see a retention rate. I mean, I guess, in common with the market, our best clients are
achieving small discounts, which simply reﬂects a relatively soft market environment and
the broad, very competitive market conditions. I mean, that would imply for me that, I
mean, not only it's rate in some areas, slightly negative but allowing for loss cost inﬂation
and margins are deﬁnitely softening overall for the businesses that we're in.
But, if you focus on where we're tackling the issues, so I guess we talked before at the
year-end around the lower performing tiers being the key areas of focus. And there you
can see that we're achieving signiﬁcant multiples of the overall stated entries for GI albeit
at a cost of lower retention. So, again, I think, that combination is to be entirely expected.
But on the connection side, I mean, we have a very small impact from the impact from
some of the mass consumer stuﬀ we've done in Latin America. We have a true-up on
commissions and our crop (23:19) business in the U.S. has a slightly negative impact in the
quarter. But at this stage, I'm not aware of anything that would drive the acquisition
element of the expense ratio, either up or down. I'm assuming the business mix stays
relatively consistent throughout the remainder of the year.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

And the rate, 2.5%, how does it compare to underlying claims inﬂation? Will you say, 1%,
1.5% claims inﬂation right now?

Page 9 of 23



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG

Sorry, I don't have a precise number. I mean, for me, the net sum for the market overall is
clearly slightly negative. I mean, obviously we're achieving more than the market because
of what we're doing on the portfolio and risk selection. I mean, I wouldn't disagree with
the number you gave, but I don't have a precise ﬁgure (24:03).

The next question is from Andrew Ritchie, Autonomous. Please go ahead.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Hi there. I guess I wanted to really understand a bit more about the beneﬁts from change
reinsurance as they might accrue over the year. I think Q1, this year; have still included
quite high large losses, at least one point higher than last year. And maybe just remind us
what you've put in place for large losses in terms of aggregate reinsurance protection. I'm
not talking natural catastrophe, I'm taking underlying kind of large losses. And just a
reminder of the fact that we started Q1 last year quite strongly, and then, we know what
happened in the rest of the year. So just remind us what arrangements there?

Bloomberg Transcript

Also, are there any other reinsurance beneﬁts in terms of the attritional level? If you've
ceded and done quota shares and some quite high loss ratio business, for example, are
there some earn throughs to occur there?
Second quick question, your friends at the road produced a comprehensive walk through
from SST to Solvency II. I see you've saved money by not doing the same thing. But can
you just give us directionally, would you kind of – I'm sure you looked at it. Is there any
sort of directional sense for you in terms of SST to Solvency II and any measure of
quantum you have in the past at about 70 percentage points to some of the subsidiaries is
not roughly still the right number? Thanks.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thanks, Andrew. Excuse me. So ﬁrst of all on the reinsurance side, just a reminder of the
aggregate cover we have in place. So as of January 1, we have an accident year cover
payer risk. Franchise is $15 million, deductible is $300,000, cover is $300,000 (25:45). I
won't give you a precise update on where that stands after one quarter, but we have used
a bit more than one quarter of the cover in terms of how much has been ceded to the
deductible.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

So you've used a bit more than one quarter of the deductible, you haven't use the cover
yet?

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}
Page 10 of 23

No. (26:05).

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

All right.

FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

On top of that, maybe just to give a touch more color. I mean, we've obviously added a
number of new reinsurance programs beneath that cover. So we have quota share on a
number places that was designed to bring the line size down more rapidly than we could
do otherwise. I mean, I hesitate to take one example and trying to enter some like a giant
projection of the future. But just to give you a sense not only the – I think the potential
beneﬁt of what we done on reinsurance but also the beneﬁt of what Kristof and the team
have done around underwriting.
So we have one of our larger losses and one of the components of our General Insurance
is a net $35 million loss. If that had happened on the last day of last year, it would be a
$50 million loss. If it had happened on a contract that we had written starting this year, it
would be a $15 million loss.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, we won't get all the execution absolutely perfect ﬁrst time at the gate across of this. I
mean, we will be impacted by the seasonality of – I mean, the diﬀerent risks that we run. I
mean, we're doing everything we can to avoid the pattern (27:24) that you saw last year.
And there's no reason for me to believe that that's a likely pattern for us to repeat this
year.
And, in fact, I mean, if you look at the aggregate cover in particular, I mean, to the extent
that we continue to see signiﬁcant large loss activity. We have one point more than Q1 last
year, one point less than the year overall. So we some improvements certainly versus the
second half of last year but we still expect some more to come. But if we do have the
same experience, we'll see signiﬁcant beneﬁts from the aggregate in the second half. I
hope not.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

And is there any beneﬁt the attritional level from the quota shares? I mean, I don't know if
your quota share some casualty business or something like that does come through.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

I mean, they're maybe a very, very small fractional beneﬁt on the ceding commission. I
mean, if it would be material, I would isolate to...

On the topic of my friends on the road, I mean, you're right. So we haven't done the same
thing. The ﬁgure that you referred to was – so, the 70-point was our estimate of what we
were seeing from an SST perspective versus what was typically standard model for most
of the local businesses that we have in Europe. So from an overall internal model
perspective, I think it'd be a bit less but there's certainly a signiﬁcant diﬀerence in SST,
Solvency ratio and a Solvency tier 1 (28:53) and SST is considerately more conceptive. But
I mean, I couldn't give you more than we gave you last year at this stage.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi, guys. Thanks very much. Just on your 5% reduction in local currency, the GI top line, is
there anything that could accelerate that? I mean, in terms seasonality and renewals or
further actions that you're taking on pricing later in the year. That's question one.
And secondly, in the Life business, I mean, you already alluded to LatAm being
exceptionally strong in the quarter and not to repeated. Could you explain that? But also, I
mean Asia Pac and LatAm both looked particularly strong. So I just want to get a sense of
what the current non-recurring elements are there and what's driving it? Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

On the 5-point reduction and I mean the risks, I mean, I'd refer you both to what Mario
said and his response earlier and some that Kristof had said at the year end. I mean,
proﬁtability is what matters most here, what drive the allocation of capital based on the
proﬁtability of the risks that are presented to us. We tried to make a reasonable estimate,
what we think the impact of that would be on the portfolio overall. And at this stage, we
see no reason to vary that estimate. Proﬁtability comes ﬁrst. So, if we have to drive it out,
we would. But at this stage, we don't expect to see that.
On LatAm, I mean, I wasn't trying to talk LatAm down or to give you the impression it was
one-oﬀ. I mean, it's just the strength of the business in Latin America given the local
economy and the challenges that some of the countries have there. I think it's a surprising
positive. I think we've said for some time though that we think that the growth rate that

Page 12 of 23

the joint venture has been achieving, at some point, will not continue at the same very
high level. And that's really – I'm really trying to reiterate the same point.

FINAL

So there's more element that's non-recurring. But just given the challenging environment,
it's very hard for me to imagine that we can sustain this kind of growth rate. We can still
grow, just not at 29% every single quarter.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

And sorry, just I know I've used up my two questions, but just on LatAm and non-life, I
mean that just looks materially better than a lot of other companies reporting. Your mix is
diﬀerent. Your product is diﬀerent. Your speech (31:24) diﬀerent. But still, I mean, are you
sort of happy now in the kind of in the 90s and combined ratio that this will be repeated?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So I think on the...

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

I won't hold you to it. Don't worry about it.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

I think on the LatAm side of it, I mean, I think the team that we've had in position – as you
know, we changed most of the management and they're over the course of the last 12
months to 18 months. We've got a stable team now down there for about 12. I think the
steps that they're taking have had an appreciable impact on the result. I'm not sure it will
immediately continue at the levels you've seen. I think it will probably edge up again as
we go through the year. But I mean, if you look at – you pick our largest business there, I
think it produced a loss in excess of $200 million last year. We're expecting to see
something more like breakeven this year, but not a low to mid 90 combined ratio, so we
have almost certainly some non-recurring elements in the results that you've seen here.

Q - Michael Igor Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Fantastic. Thank you. My peers are very good – or you're very good. Most of my questions
have been answered. But maybe in a bit of detail. On the tiering, can you explain a little
bit the beneﬁt, which is yet to come from the actions that you detailed on the last slide.
I'm thinking that, obviously, not all the price would have been earned through and maybe
not all the cancellations. So, maybe you can give some insight in that. I think maybe we
could do it, but I'm sure we can – we'd need the combined ratios for each tier.

FINAL

And then on a separate topic, and here I'm just – it's a stab in the dark, really. I had in
mind, but I may be completely wrong, but you had a plan or an idea to improve cash ﬂow
by reallocating capital and that might have involved some disposals. I can't remember
what disposal you did make year-to-date. But if you did, can you maybe give an indication
of how much they add to cash ﬂow or something and maybe if you're considering more?
Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you, Michael. Soon the tiering topic and the impact to come, so I mean, the
ﬁgure that we'd be discussing from a volume perspective is GWP. So the cancellations are
in the GWP already. Obviously, the bulk number – what we're talking about is the end
number. So the largest part of the beneﬁt from a rate perspective is not in the bulk at this
point.

Bloomberg Transcript

I mean apart from the obvious P&L beneﬁt of the rate increase in excess of the loss cost
inﬂation, if you look at the Tier 4 element, I mean, that's really only partly above rate. I
mean, it's really probably more about risk selection and picking the risks that we feel we
want the rate (34:28) and oﬀers, I mean, not just the rate/risk reward but we have the right
understanding, the right information and the conﬁdence in the loss control.
So I think there's a mathematical element. I mean, I think I haven't tried to do it here. I
mean, obviously I can see it in our internal forecasts. I think there probably is enough
information to make a reasonable stab at it. The thing that you probably can do, and it's
very hard for me to give you on is the beneﬁt of that risk selection and of course, that's
really important when it comes to the large loss topic that I covered in the earlier
discussion or the earlier question from Andrew. So cancellations and most of the beneﬁt
from tiering from a P&L perspective here to come.
On the cash ﬂow and the disposal, let me start from beginning. So, I mean, you've had it
so often you're probably bored by it. I mean, we're focusing the...

Q - Michael Igor Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Never. Never. Never. It's worth a lot of money.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So, we're focusing the retail footprint and the aim there is to simplify the network and
really focus our capital (35:35) what we believe we can achieve the scale that retail really
needs. Other than that, if you are in a niche position, we don't have that many niche
positions. It was actually nothing do with cash ﬂow. I mean, it was a capital reallocation
play, but it's not really to do a cash ﬂow. The things you've seen so far, I mean, since the – I
think you've had most of them already.
So, we thought with the Middle East run oﬀ topic, I mean, we are active on a number of
fronts currently. I'm not going to expect more to say on this on due course. I think just to
continue expectations about here. I mean we have a proven out disposal that would
tackle the (36:16) and 10% of the underperforming capital. So, I mean, it will certainly take
Page 14 of 23



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG
Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2016-05-12

a signiﬁcant step in the right direction, but there's much more to do to drive a much more
attractive return on the bulk of that allocated capital. I mean, you will hear more from us
on this in due course.

The next question is from Andy Hughes, Macquarie. Please go ahead.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Hi. It's Andy Hughes from Macquarie. A couple of questions if I could. The ﬁrst one was on
slide seven where I look at the diﬀerent tiers. It kind of looked from both the charts and
look at the total, the Tier 4 is quite small. Otherwise, you couldn't give the average of 81%
and obviously the 2.5% is that a fair comment?

Bloomberg Transcript

And I guess the second question was about the OOB stuﬀ. So I'm struggling a bit
because obviously the OOB result was quite low in this quarter and I know you're guiding
towards increased marketing spend in further quarters, but also you're saying that you've
retired a lot of expenses debt that would go through that line as well. So I'm struggling to
see how you're going to get to $800 million for the full year, is there anything I'm missing
there? Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

On Tier 4, I mean, we haven't quantiﬁed Tier 4. I mean, Tier 4 is not that small. And in fact,
if we look at Tier 4 from a contribution to loans perspective the last year is not small at all.
It's actually very signiﬁcant. I mean that's the key driver of that change that you're seeing
here. I mean, again, maybe just to emphasize again something I said earlier, it's only
partly about rates. (37:57) is far more about risk selection. So I wouldn't necessarily draw
conclusions about the absolute volume, the absolute rate and that's been the key driver
here. I'm not sure if we're trying to select things that we believe we have a good handle
on.
On OOB, also we have a relatively low number. For the quarter, we have a FX beneﬁt in
there that tends to – that will be one-oﬀ in nature. And therefore, it creates a lower than
expected run rate. I mean, we'll have a modest entries on the marketing side before we
get to the very end of the year. I mean, if you ask me today, I mean, I think we're more
likely to beat the $800 million than to wind at $800 million, but we got more work to do
to make sure that we can do that. But I certainly don't expect we're going to miss that
number.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

So, a follow-up on this Tier 4 side. Sorry, I was just curious how big it was in terms of
proportion of the – as a book. Because if you just look at the charts you can see that the

Page 15 of 23



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG
Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity

two of them are only – it's easier to scale, the Tier 1 and Tier 2 only slightly above the 81%.
And the Tier 4 has got a much lower retention. So, I mean, it's not like a quarter of the
premium income or anything.

A - George Quinn

I understood the question. And I deliberately avoided answering it.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

I mean, I think it would be more helpful. I mean, it's obviously not quarter, but it's not 10%
either. This is a signiﬁcant part of the overall portfolio.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Okay. All right.

Oh. Hi, there. Thank you very much. First question is for Mario. I know it's early days but I
wondered, are you thinking or can you share with us any initial thoughts about business
mix changes like, for example, moving more into personal lines, getting away perhaps
from the commercial line focus.
Second question, more for George, is you've obviously got quite big premium reductions
in Global Corporate and NAC. And I just wondered, do you expect this to continue? And
how concerned are you that this is going to eat into the expense ratio this year? I mean, I
know you said that the expense ratio should be ﬂat but if this continues, that's going to be

Nick, hi. This is Mario here. Of course, you understand that it's very early days to talk
about business mix. And this will be a big part of the thoughts on the new strategy and
the new targets for November. But you asked me what are my early thoughts on it. So, I
do think that having a bigger share of retail SME business will be helpful. The question is
more how to do it and how to achieve it. And it goes back to also the way we're organized
and the way we pursue our targets. And so I'm keen to ﬁnd ways to grow more the SMEs
and the retail components in our books, but I'm not yet there where have planned
programs and I can discuss them with any of you.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 21515144 <GO>}

Okay. Very fair. Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Nick, on the second point of the premium reduction, so I mean, so far, we've seen a
reduction in the top line which is in line with our expectation and what we'd indicated to
you previously. It won't stop immediately at Q2 nor do we expect that to continue
indeﬁnitely either. I mean, once we get the portfolio to the position that we are seeking to
achieve, you should see the normal inﬂuence on top line that you'd expect to see in the
business.
From an expense ratio perspective, again, the clear guidance to the business and the
clear ambition of the business is around proﬁtability. So the extent to which some of the
volume reduction creates a challenge for expenses as Mario said earlier and as Kristof has
also said before, I mean, if that becomes an issue, we'll go back and tackle it when it
arises, but the immediate focus is on proﬁtability.
Within the diﬀerent units, you picked a Global Corporate and NAC, I mean, obviously,
Global Corporate in particular, especially in North America, it was a large part of the
challenge last year. Therefore, I think you would naturally expect that that would be one of
the areas where you would see a larger proportional decline than you would for the
Group overall.

Yes. Hello. Just two small questions. The ﬁrst one again on the reserving side. Can you
maybe specify gain on the reserving process? If you do all the external reviews you have
done – you said all done or are there more reviews to come later on from an external
point of view or today, if you just go to the normal end of year process on reserving? The

Page 17 of 23

second one is on duration gap between change year or is that probably unchanged from
end of the year?

FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Hi, Stefan. So, on reserving and process, process is normal, it would be the best
description of it. I mean, we're doing the same thing that we always do on the quarter
end. I mean, I guess in common with most companies, we have a continuous process
rather than a particular focus on any given quarter.
I mean, from an external review perspective, we've commented in the past that – certainly
through the course of 2014 and the early part of 2015, we had a number of areas where
we had mandated reviews by regulators. Again, that's a completely normal process in
today's regulated insurance world.
For us, from an internal policy perspective, the only thing that we have come out that
would be external in nature that we were traditionally have an external review of
employers' liability or APH exposures, I mean typically every two to three years. At some
point over the next 12 months to 24 months, we'll conduct another review of those
reserves to the extent that we still have those risks in the portfolio.
On the duration gap, I mean it's largely unchanged from the end of last year. I mean,
we're very slightly a long on the asset side.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Hi. Good afternoon. Just very quickly two things. First, again back on slide seven just to
understand. I understand the achieved price, technical price and tiering focus was also
there in the past. Have you seen any reason to change some of the underlying models
that deﬁne this tiering or deﬁne these technical prices? Or maybe it's too early but I just
thought it'll be helpful to understand and show us what kind of changes are going on in
the group?
Second question is just a little bit more on the cash ﬂow. Obviously, given this slight bit of
volume and also management actions that we had earlier heard about, like, for example,
U.S. extraordinary dividends. Is there any update on these management actions you can
provide, please?
And I need to follow up quick one, just on the last comment you made. George, did you
say that the top line was continued in 2Q but not after or – if you'd just verify that please,

that would be great. Thank you.

FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Taking the last one ﬁrst. Just – I mean to repeat again, the guidance for this year for is
actually earned premium was that we expect to see a reduction in premium volume in the
mid-single-digit range. So I mean while we continue the actions that we have underway
with MGI (46:39) and the market continues to be very competitive, I mean that will have
an impact on volume.
I didn't limit any period, but again, I don't expect it to continue quarter-after-quarter. But
today, we certainly have instructed – have not instructed GI that they need to stop this
(46:47) What GI has to do is to deliver the planned proﬁt for the year.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the tiering, I mean I guess, it's – I mean it's probably pretty obvious that the execution
of tiering has poor, otherwise we could not have ended up and the position that we
ended up in last year. And a lot of what we did at the end of the last year was to reinforce
discipline around that topic, Kristof and his team I mean have reinforced that process
signiﬁcantly. We talked already about some of the changes that we made to promote that.
So I won't repeat it here. I mean we have an altogether diﬀerent focus on tiering. It's
absolutely crucial for the delivery of (47:42) plan and everyone completely understands
that.
On the cash ﬂow, I mean also the volume side of things, that will have no impact on cash
ﬂow because the cash ﬂows will be driven by the proﬁtability at the end and the improved
proﬁtability will have a much bigger impact than the volume cuts that we're seeing. So
that topic, no issue.
One of the management actions that we're taking to make sure that we maximized cash
ﬂows in a year, we suﬀered a bit of a hangover from the GI performance of last year. I
mean I've got no precise update for you today. I mean we've talked in the past about the
things that are possible. We're working on those. We still remain very conﬁdent we will
deliver cumulative cash ﬂows over the three-year period of more than $10 billion. That's
the end for the year.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Yes. Hi. Ralph Hebgen from KBW. Just two things. One is would you be able to talk about
the large loss experience which you had in the quarter and put this into sort of back to
(48:55) framework of where your large losses will obviously in third quarter and fourth

quarter, but also where you see them going over the remainder of the year. That was
number one.
And second one is on the reserve releases. Well, obviously, it was actually quite
heartening to see that Global Corporate and North America Commercial were material
contributors to the reserve releases. Could you give us some more color on that? What
were the lines of business that drove those reserve releases and also which accident years
were behind actually? Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks, Ralph. So on large loss experience, if you compare it to the same quarter
last year, we are one point heavier. If you compare to the year overall, we're 1 point better,
and obviously it's a signiﬁcant improvement over Q3 and Q4 last year. I mean I think we
hadn't necessarily expected to see a signiﬁcant shift in the large loss experience in Q1
other than because of the random incidents of events, because of the – because the
impact to things that we started, of course, wouldn't have had a major impact in Q1.

Bloomberg Transcript

And you see that more as the year goes on. I mean I think the things that I can't point to in
Q1. I mentioned earlier that obviously we have in some parts of the portfolio more
reinsurance protection quite apart from the aggregate cover. I mean we have a loss that I
mentioned is $35 million in the quarter. It would've been $50 million, that have happened
before the year end. And if I given the new underwriting requirements that we have in
place. If it was on a new contract that we ran this year, it would be $15 million.
So I mean again beyond the commentary we've made before that we expect to see
further improvement on the large loss side because of the underwriting action and the
reinsurance program. I mean I can't give you very precise guidance because, there will be
some randomness in the outcome. But I expect to see further improvement over what
you've seen in Q1.
On reserve releases, I mean it's a quarter that's slap bang in the middle of the guidance
that we've given. If I look at all of the areas that have been problematic in the past for us,
we are all quiet. So commercial auto is stable, TBA (51:13) is stable, the contractor line of
business is stable. The main positives are coming out of – I mean the majority that coming
out of – I mean relatively recent years on property. So property is the main driver.
But in general, I mean, reserve picture and actually fairly globally, is pretty consistent. I
mean the one place that stands out, is particularly strong still is Switzerland. But in
general, we are in a reasonably good position in most places.

Hello. Hi there. Sorry to come back. I just wanted to get a quick update on Farmers. You
talked about putting through more rate actions. I think the implication is you expect that
to start impacting top line because you have a fall oﬀ in retention.

FINAL

I mean, there already has been some improvement quarter-on-quarter in auto. I mean
what are the extensive rate actions and do you really think the trade-oﬀs in volume and
rate is going to result in sort of premium shrinkage there or is that too strong?
And the second question, just to – I wanted to clarify, George. I think you said you're still
going through the footprint examination process. That is also happening. And actually,
you have some pipeline of some modest things to come through. Is that what you meant?
Thanks.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

All right. So, as to the second one is, yes. That's a good summary. On the ﬁrst one, on
Farmers, I mean, we've seen a very – we've seen strong growth – the exchanges have seen
strong growth in the ﬁrst quarter. Obviously, the combined ratio also continues to be at a
level that from a longer term perspective is not sustainable. I mean that's been a key area
for the exchanges last year. And in fact, the rates that the exchange is ﬁled for, the
exchange is ﬁled for, is the main driver of the premium volume. I mean given the plans
that Jeﬀ and the team have for the remainder of this year. I don't expect we'll see
shrinkage, but I think you would expect the growth rate to slightly cool compared to
where we are today. So it won't go into reverse, but I don't think you'll see a continuing
6% increase in the continuing business. It will be lower in the remainder of the year.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

because the underlying proﬁtability is so weak. (54:14) thoughts of having these some
kind of trade oﬀ there yet.

Yes. And good afternoon and good morning, everyone. Just a big picture question. So
this one is on debt (54:45), have you changed anything with regard to your risk
committees? I know the incidents happened at last year, but I was very much surprised to
see what happened in Yanjing (54:45) And my question was then, is the risk committee
within the Zurich Group really where it should be. So I was wondering any changes here.
And then just also in regard to Group's structure. Mario, you mentioned before that you
would like to simplify the Group's structure and then I was wondering I've seen some

are challenges in a number of areas of the organization, I wouldn't pick out risk as the only
part. And obviously, risk, underwriting ﬁnance, a number of areas have had (56:17) made
signiﬁcant changes to make sure that we can deliver on the commitments we've made for
this year. I mean there've been a large number of changes up and down in the

to have three diﬀerent CEOs and this structure has been uniﬁed under one country's CEO
and this allowed not just to simplify the business cards, but also to unify functions and
priorities in the market and so that investments also better ﬁnalized where they have to
go. This has also been started in Italy and would likely continue in other countries. And
again, it's a trend that I support and makes sense. It is how the market. It's organized itself
and it ﬁts well with the customer organization and mindset.
On FinTech, Zurich has been investing heavily in data developments, data applications.
Zurich has almost 600 people working on data analytics and data developments. So there
is a lot here to build from and there are probably – there have been many more
investments in the number of years.

My eﬀorts in the space is to understand how to make the best use of this information and
what else can be done with the information with this skills and with the capabilities that we

skills and by the data available.
