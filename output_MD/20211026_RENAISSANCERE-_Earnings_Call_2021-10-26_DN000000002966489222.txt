Kevin O'Donnell
Thank you, Keith. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining today's call.
Regarding our financial results, this was a difficult quarter and a continuation of what we
have been experiencing in the P&C industry over the last five years. That said, we believe
that the market will continue to experience significant rate increases, which will accrue to
the benefit of our shareholders.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let's start by discussing the third quarter. Given the large catastrophe losses, I will focus
my comments primarily on our property business, where climate change, social inflation,
and other loss drivers that caused elevated losses. As you would expect, reinsurers have
absorbed a significant share of this volatility.
Absorbing volatility is an important component of our value proposition to our customers.
Over the past five years, we have delivered on this promise. Ultimately, however, we
need to be paid adequately for the risk that we assume. And the returns for our
shareholders over the recent five-year period, were not sufficient for capital, they have
deployed. Our industry that is experienced more change recently than at any time since
our founding in 1993. In response, we set out to build the capabilities and scale needed to
generate superior returns in this marketplace. We began this journey by forming our
Lloyd's syndicate, continued with the acquisitions of Platinum and TMR, accelerated with
the expansion of our capital partners business, and culminated with last year's capital
raise, which afforded us the ability to lean into one of the best reinsurance markets we've
experienced since a long time.
We are now at an inflection point in our evolution. We have built an organization that will
succeed in an industry impacted by low-interest rates, abundant third-party capital, social
inflation, and climate change.
It is now time to monetize what we have built. Our fortress balance sheet will help us
achieve this goal as it easily absorbs this quarter's losses. Our shares have been trading
at attractive levels, which provides us more options to deploy excess capital, than
probably at any other time in recent history.

Date: 2021-10-26

As you saw, we continue to repurchase our shares in the fourth quarter, and thanks to our
strong excess capital position, expect to continue to do so in 2022. The attractiveness of
our shares versus other opportunities places an increasingly higher hurdle against
deploying excess capital into our business.

FINAL

We have achieved competitive scale, and we'll only pursue future growth to the extent
new businesses is expected to clear stringent profitability hurdle rates.
This will allow our underwriters to focus on building efficient portfolios through pricing
discipline and strong underwriting. We will continue to engage with our clients, discussing
our developing view of risk, and the pricing and structures that are needed to provide fair
returns to absorb the volatility.
At times, these discussions may prove difficult or challenging, I'm comfortable reducing on
any business that we do not believe will create superior returns for our shareholders.
This results in additional excess capital. We have more tools than ever to manage it
effectively. That said, I expect that we will write a larger and more profitable portfolio in
2022. To begin with, the property market has enjoyed material rate increases over the
last five years, which will continue to earn through.

Bloomberg Transcript

Rate increases have been similar, if not steeper in the casualty market over the last three
years. Going forward, we believe rates will continue to rise across the industry for several
reasons.
First, due to continuing volatility, realized results have lagged expected returns in the
industry at large for several years. As a result, substantial proportions of the reinsurance
industry, in particular, third-party capital have failed to earn their cost of capital. Investor
patience is wearing thin and they are requiring increased return profiles to accept volatility.
We expect retro capacity will shrink due to poor performance and substantial trapped
capital. Any retro that is available will likely move up an attachment level, so we'll shift
protection from earnings to capital. There is less retro at lower attachment points,
reinsurers will be more exposed to income statement volatility.
Since the cost of accepting volatility has risen, the supply reinsurance will decrease and
further push rate.
Third, social inflation will continue plaguing the industry, and price inflation will increasingly
push up loss costs.
And fourth, persistent losses and the fear of climate change will likely raise primary
carriers demand for hedges against their own volatility.

FINAL

We expect these various dynamics will reduce the supply of, and increase the demand
for, the products that we sell. This will result in further rate increases and improved
profitability. I should also note that our casualty business is now beginning to reflect the
substantial rate improvements of the last three years.
As a result, this quarter, we reduced our initial expected loss ratio by three points. We
absorbed the casualty segment share of cat losses and still made an underwriting profit, I
will discuss this further in the second half of my comments, but suffice it to say that we
anticipate casualty will increasingly contribute to our bottom line in the future.
So when I look forward to 2022, I'm very excited about our prospects. Our fortress
balance sheet allows us to maintain our current underwriting portfolio or even grow it, if
desirable. Increasing rates across our business will add to the portfolio's profitability.
Finally, prudent capital management will leverage our potential to generate bottom-line
profitability on a percentage of equity basis.
That concludes my opening comments, I'll provide more detailed update on our segment
performance at the end of the call, but first, I'll turn it over to Bob to discuss the financial
performance for the quarter.

Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks, Kevin and good morning, everyone. As Kevin pointed out, this was an active
season for catastrophes, which is reflected in our results for the quarter.
I'll discuss our performance in detail, but there are two main points I want to take away.
First, we have maintained a fortress balance sheet that gives us tremendous flexibility to
create value for shareholders by actively managing how we deploy our capital.
We will grow if underwriting opportunities are sufficiently profitable, but equally, we can
continue to repurchase our shares at attractive multiples.
Second, the business that we have invested in and grown this year, casualty, and other
property, continue to trend in a positive direction and we're starting to recognize these
results in our financials.
This quarter, we had the confidence to lower our initial expected loss ratio in casualty by 3
percentage points. Additionally, the attritional loss ratio for other property has been
steadily improving as a result of the portfolio management activities we discussed with
you at the beginning of last year.
With this in mind, I'll start my comments with a discussion of our capital position, how we
are thinking about managing this capital going into the January renewals.
I will then move to our consolidated results and three drivers of profit.

Company Ticker: RN R US Equity

So starting with capital management, and this is an active quarter and material share
repurchases, our capital position remains strong. Weather-related Large losses were
within expectations and we have sufficient capital and liquidity to absorb them.

FINAL

We generally like to hold an excess capital buffer of up to a billion dollars, which gives us
the flexibility to take advantage of future opportunities. As we look ahead to 2022, we're
very comfortable with our excess capital position.
As you know, our first preference is to always to deploy capital into profitable business
opportunities, and second, to return the excess to shareholders, which we have been
doing this year.
As Kevin explained, this framework is still valid, but because our stock valuation is so
attractive, our hurdle rates for an attractive underwriting opportunity is higher than it has
been in the past. Ultimately, our goal is to grow tangible book value per share. Going into
January 1 renewals, our fortress balance sheet provides multiple levers to do just that. We
have sufficient capital to support our existing risk and we will continue to grow if price
increases in 2022 proves sufficient.

Bloomberg Transcript

But similarly, we anticipate returning capital to our shareholders at a pace roughly equal to
net earnings. Moving now from our capital management framework to the capital
management activities, we undertook in the third quarter.
As I mentioned in the last call, we issued $500 million of our Series G Perpetual
preference shares in the third quarter. The Series G has a fixed for life dividend 4.20%
and we use $275 million of the proceeds to refinance our 5% and 3% Series E preference
shares. As a result, we increased our outstanding preference equity by $225 million.
We also purchased $1.5 million common shares for about $224 million in the third quarter.
This works out to an average price per share of about $151 and an average price to book
value of less than 1.2 times our current book value.
Subsequent to quarter-end, we continue to repurchase shares, and as of October 21,
have repurchased an additional 518,000 shares for $75 million at an average price of just
over $145 per share. In total, this year we have repurchased 5 million shares for $780
million at an average price of $155 per share, reducing our share count by about 10% of
the year-end 2022.
Even after Weather-related Large losses and active share repurchases, our total common
and preferred equity position with $6.75 billion at the end of the quarter. This is roughly
flat compared to our equity position immediately following last year's equity raise and
provides us with scale and flexibility to effectively execute our strategy with improved
capital efficiency.
Moving now to our consolidated results, we reported a net loss of $450 million and
operating loss of $415 million for the quarter. These results were driven by a net negative
Page 5 of 23



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2021-10-26

impact of $727 million from the Weather-related Large losses, primarily from Hurricane Ida,
record flooding in the North-Western Europe, and losses from aggregate contracts.

FINAL

As a result, we reported annualized return on average common equity of negative 28%
and annualized operating return on average common equity of negative 26%.
I will now shift to our three drivers of profit starting with underwriting income, where we
grew gross premiums written by $631 million or 55% with the Property segment, growing
$346 million in the Casualty segment growing $285 million.
This quarter, we reported $255 million of reinstatement premiums from the Weatherrelated Large losses, this compares to $54 million of reinstatement premiums related to
the Q3 2020 large-loss events.
Excluding these reinstatement premiums, gross premiums written were up 39%. Year-todate net premiums written were up 44% to $4.8 billion, and we remain on track to
comfortably surpass $1 billion in growth for the year, even when excluding reinstatement
premiums.

Bloomberg Transcript

Most of this growth has come from Casualty and Specialty and other property or where
we have seen strong rate increases this year. We reported underwriting losses of $679
million in the quarter and a combined ratio of 145%, 74 percentage points of which are
from the Weather-related Large losses. Specifically, 43 points are from Hurricane Ida and
19 points are from European floods.
Our Property segment were gross premiums written increased by $346 million or 81%.
Reinstatement premiums from large loss events in the third quarter increased by $202
million year-over-year, with the vast majority impacting the property catastrophe class of
business. Excluding these, growth in property premiums was $144 million for 38%, with
other property of $182 million or 73%, and property catastrophe down $38 million or 30%.
This is not a major renewal period for property catastrophe in the decline excluding
reinstatements is partially driven by a few bespoke nonrecurring deals that we wrote in
the third quarter of 2020.
We reported a current accident year loss ratio of 180% and a combined ratio of 184% in
the Property segment, driven by the Weather-related large losses, which added 141
percentage points to the combined ratio.
As a reminder, our other property book contains both attritional and catastrophe risk. The
current accident year loss ratio of 112% included 66 percentage points from the Weatherrelated large losses. The attritional portion of other property business has been steadily
improving since last year and has been consistently below 50% in 2021. There were also
18 points of favorable development in property this quarter, primarily related to the 2017
to 2019 large catastrophe events in the property catastrophe class of business.

Now, moving onto our Casualty results where we reported gross premiums written of $1
billion growing $285 million or 40% versus the comparable quarter.

FINAL

As we have received more information, we are starting to reflect some of the positive
rate trends we have seen in Casualty over the last few years.
As Kevin noted, this quarter we reduced our initial expected loss ratio by 3 percentage
points, which should have a favorable effect on the current accident year loss ratio going
forward.
This is one factor of many, and we expect the current accident year loss ratio could
fluctuate based on loss events, business mix, and other items in the quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

The combined ratio for Casualty was 99.6% and current accident year loss ratio was 69%.
The Weather Related Large losses added 3.5 percentage points to these ratios. Excluding
the impact of weather-related large, catastrophe events and COVID, the current accident
year loss ratio for Casualty has improved modestly compared to the last several quarters
and full-year 2020. These improved margins both in casualty and other property are an
increased earned premium based up 43% and 73% respectively from the third quarter,
while our capital base remained flat.
This demonstrates the enhanced premium leverage, we are starting to achieve following
our growth initiatives in these segments over the last 12 to 18 months. Now, moving on to
our second driver of profit, fee income. Total fee income in the quarter was $28 million,
which reflects the impact of the Weather-related large losses in 2021. Starting with
management fees, which were down compared to recent quarters, this decline is
primarily driven by year-to-date losses in [inaudible]which triggered a deferral of
management fees.
We expect to recapture these fees in future quarters at the point that [inaudible] returns
to a net profit position. In general, management fees are related to the growth and our
joint venture vehicles and they should steadily increase over time.
Now, moving to performance fees, which were up compared to the third quarter of 2020.
This difference primarily relates to performance fee reversals. In the third quarter of
2020, we reversed previously booked performance fees, which led to a negative result.
This year, however, performance fees have been low year-to-date due to losses from
winter storm Uri, removing the need to reverse in this quarter.
Overall, we shared $198 million of underwriting losses with partners in our joint ventures,
as reflected in our redeemable non-controlling interest driven by Weather-related large
losses.
Turning now to our third driver of profit, investment income. Net investment income was
$78 million, which is consistent with the second quarter of 2021. This was partially offset by

Page 7 of 23



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2021-10-26

$42 million in realized and unrealized losses, resulting in total investment returns of $36
million.

FINAL

$31 million of these realized and unrealized losses came from our fixed maturity portfolio
and were primarily related to increased interest rates on medium and some longer
duration treasuries and a modest widening in credit spreads in some sectors.
The yield on our retained fixed maturity portfolio stayed constant at 1.3% and the duration
on our retained portfolio decreased slightly to 3.7 years. We remain very comfortable with
the composition of our investment portfolio and believe that it provides the liquidity that
we need to support our underwriting business.
At this point, I'll turn to our expenses. Starting with the acquisition expense ratio, which
remained flat at 22%. The Casualty expense ratio increased by 4 percentage points to
28%, which is consistent with our expectation. As a reminder, the acquisition expense ratio
in the third quarter of 2020 was low due to reduced profit commissions associated with
losses in our mortgage book.

Bloomberg Transcript

The property acquisition expense ratio decreased by 3 percentage points to 16%
primarily related to the increase in reinstatement premiums. Excluding the impact of
reinstatement premiums, the property acquisition expense ratio increased from the
comparable quarter.
As a reminder, the other property business typically carries a higher acquisition cost ratio
than property catastrophe. So we would expect the acquisition cost ratio to increase, as
other properties becomes a more meaningful part of our property portfolio. Our direct
expense ratio, which is the sum of our operational and corporate expenses divided by net
premiums earned was 5%. This is broadly flat with last year after excluding the impact of
loss on sale of the RenRe UK Limited and some other one-time items from the third
quarter of 2020.
On an absolute basis, operational expenses were up in the quarter, but the operational
expense ratio declined by 1 percentage point to 4%. Now, before I turn it back to Kevin, I'd
like to spend a moment on global tax developments.
As I mentioned on the last call we've been closely following recent announcements on
setting a global minimum corporate tax, the OECD's work on Pillar 1 and Pillar 2, and
President Biden's proposals for US tax changes.
In October, the OECD announced a framework between many countries to institute a 15%
global minimum tax. However, most of the practical details about how this would be
implemented are not yet clear. We are monitoring this issue closely and believe that our
global operating platform will continue to provide us with a competitive advantage.
So in conclusion, while our results for the quarter were impacted by natural catastrophes,
we are seeing positive momentum across both segments.
Page 8 of 23



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2021-10-26

We have taken a very active approach to capital management and going into the
important January 1 renewals have built a fortress balance sheet that provides many
levers to build value for our shareholders.

FINAL

And with that, I'll turn it back over to Kevin.

Kevin O'Donnell
Thanks, Bob. As usual, I'll divide my comments between our property and catastrophe
segments. Starting with Property, I thought it'd be helpful to spend a few minutes
discussing the loss drivers for natural catastrophes, including the evolving impact of
climate change and the increasing cost due to inflation.
For almost two decades, we have invested heavily to understand the influence of climate
change on weather and its impact on the risks that we take. RennaissanceRe, Risk
Sciences is a large part of this investment. It provides us a significant competitive
advantage in assessing the impact of climate change, it also aids us in continually updating
our models to reflect the latest science, such as the recent IPCC sixth assessment report.

Bloomberg Transcript

Having this ability is critical. As an example, our many decades of research on the
influence on Atlantic hurricanes helps inform our belief that the recent activity box since
1995 appropriately constitutes a new baseline from which to further refine the
assumptions that underlie our hurricane wind risk models.
In other words, due to climate change, we believe that the elevated average of the last
25 years depicts a more representative view of hurricane risk for the present and that the
long-term historic record, which serves as the baseline for the vendor hurricane models is
a poor guide for the future.
Our proprietary models reflect this elevated view of frequency and severity, and our view
of Atlantic hurricane wind risk in the context of hazard frequency and severity, as well as
expected modeled industry losses is significantly above the vendor long-term view of the
risk.
This supports our view that we are successfully incorporating the impact of climate
change into our models. It's important to note that while storms are increasing in both
frequency and severity, some of those changes are cyclical in nature and not tied to
climate change.
So while it's important to understand and price for climate change, it is not the only factor
increasing losses in the P&C industry. In all likelihood, the recent clustering of weather
events is more attributable to statistical fluctuation in arrival rates, than the influence of
climate change. In the same way that the 10-year period prior to Hurricane Irma, with this
is statistical outlier due to the absence of US landfalling hurricanes.

Page 9 of 23



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2021-10-26

FINAL

The five-year period, since then is a similar outlier for its heightened activity. Online
climate change, this is not a systemic issue and should average out over time. And then
there is inflation. Even though, Ida is tied for the fifth strongest landfalling hurricane in US
history, a storm of hurricane Ida's characteristics simply does not generate enough energy
to result in the industry losses that are being projected.
The truth is that as much as storms are getting stronger and more frequent, which we can
model for, social inflation and outright fraud are increasing loss costs in ways that are
more difficult to quantify. Price inflation also plays a role in the elevated cost of
catastrophes, in part due to labor shortages, supply chain disruptions, and rising
commodity prices affecting building costs.
So while we actively adjust our view of natural catastrophe frequency and severity for the
influence of climate change. We also know that these other factors represent a substantial
accelerator of loss costs. Consequently, we are focused on appropriately reading all of
these factors in our model, so we can be confident that we are being paid adequately for
the risks, we assume.

Bloomberg Transcript

We believe that we are successfully doing this. One indication is that actual hurricane
losses in the United States have averaged about $18.4 billion over the last five years,
which is below the average that our models predict. This strongly suggests that we are
accurately capturing recent changes.
We had an opportunity to test our models again this year with Hurricane Ida and believe
that losses will be within modeled expectations, for example, TCS is currently estimating
that Hurricane Ida industry loss is at $29 billion.
Our models indicate that Hurricane Ida industry loss is about a one and five-year event for
the US and about a 1 and 30-year event for the goals.
In other words, a large event, but not an extreme outlier. The third quarter also
experienced a large European flood from burns[ph] which is further evidence of the
expanding influence of climate change.
Bernd[ph] is likely to be about a $12 billion -$15 billion industry event, which in our view is a
50 year return period for the parallel flood in the UK, in Europe taken together.
Moving on from this discussion of loss drivers. This is the time of year we shift our
underwriting focus to the January one renewal. We are optimistic that we will find ample
opportunities to construct an improved portfolio of risks. Given the substantial losses in
the quarter, our underwriters expect to obtain increased rate and better terms and
conditions across our property book at the January 1 renewal.
This effort will be particularly focused on the property tax business, which has
experienced larger losses and smaller rate increases over the last five years relative to

Page 10 of 23



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2021-10-26

other lines. Shifting to other property, our other property business, which was also
impacted by Weather-related large losses of the quarter.

FINAL

Prior to Q3, this market was already dislocated and experiencing substantial rate
increases. Given the active quarter, we expect this favorable trend to continue.
I'm delighted with our ability to construct a high-quality, other-property portfolio. This
portfolio has been built from largely, CAT exposed excess and surplus insurance lines that
we write on a proportional basis.
This is the most impacted and dislocated segment of the property market, and our
underwriters have definitely leveraged into this space, writing more than $1.3 billion in
gross premiums so far in 2021.
Tax[ph] aside, the other property portfolio is enjoying low attritional loss emergence, as
Bob discussed in his comments. In general, this business is performing at or above our
initial expectations, and we continue to realize material rate increases.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let's now shift to the retro protection that we purchased for ourselves. Given the
Weather-related large losses, it is likely that this protection will be less available and more
expensive in 2022. Consequently, we may purchase less retro protection and take more
risk net.
With the expectation of improved rates, we are comfortable with this potential outcome.
Moving now to our Casualty and Specialty segment, heading into the January 1 renewals,
we continue to enjoy the benefit of accelerating underlying rate increases across multiple
lines of business and geographies.
As previously discussed, this quarter, we reduced our initial expected loss ratios in some
casualty classes. If pricing and trends continue as they are, expect that our casualty book
will continue to show lower combined ratios over the course of 2022, as should be the
case. Our reserving team is moving cautiously to reflect new information until recent
year's season, and we see more evidence of favorable loss of merchants. We have
discussed our casualty book being rate adequate over a rolling 10-year period, while we
continue to see a rate change above loss trend. We believe more rate is required in the
Casualty market to produce adequate returns after an extended period of rate
reductions up until about 2018.
Finally, putting aside the ongoing organic growth we have planned for 2022. By simply
earning through the Casualty portfolio that we have already written, we expect to grow
net earned premiums by over $400 million. This demonstrates enhanced premium
leverage we are beginning to achieve, which is good news in an improving market. Our
Capital Partners business continues to be core, and a growing part of our platform. Over
the past five years, we have grown our partner capital by approximately $5.2 billion, which
represents a compounded annual growth rate of about 30%.

Page 11 of 23



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td

FINAL

This allows us to bring more capital into the market and generate fees. Our fee schedules
have remained constant and we are turning away more capital than we are accepting. We
are not an asset accumulator, but rather see ourselves, as managing these funds to solve
customer problems by sourcing and matching the most desirable risk, with the most
efficient capital.
This is a business that continues to mature. Investors are demanding more accountability
for managers with respect to strong governance structures, robust, internal audit
capabilities, and a clear understanding of the importance of building ESG, transparency
responsibility, and accountability.
Given our long-term track record robust enterprise risk management framework, we
believe we maintain a considerable competitive advantage in this space.
This was a difficult quarter marked by material net and operating losses. That said, we
head to the January one renewals with ample liquidity and a fortress balance sheet. Our
fundamentals are strong, our prospects are bright, and I believe that we will have the
opportunity to underwrite an increasingly profitable portfolio of business such as the
January one renewal that will generate superior returns for our shareholders. Thank you.
And with that, I'll turn it over for questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions)
And the first question will come from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo, please go ahead.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question is just on capital. I'm trying to piece together
some of the comments throughout the call, just, are you guys willing to put, let us know
exactly how much excess capital you have today? I know your equity levels are below
where they were after the equity raise, but I think you said they were in line like that was in
the middle of the second quarter of last year, but, and you said you'd like to hold up to 1
billion buffer. But where does that actually sit today, just in terms of excess capital?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
Yeah, thanks, Elyse, hope you're doing well. Yes, I did say 6.75. Now, remember we
started our journey in building out our capital raise in the second quarter. So we raised in
the second quarter and my comments were really based off the referencing to the end of
the first quarter. We did print and unrealized gain in the portfolio in the second quarter, I
think that's your comparative out there. But as I talked about last quarter, I did the

Page 12 of 23



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2021-10-26

reconciliation in terms of earnings based on share buybacks and what we've returned
back to investors.

FINAL

But your second question on excess capital. I mean, I think it is, we're not capital
constrained, I just want to make sure that's clear and as we look to 2022, we're going to
the building of our book and it's what Kevin talked about, some pretty desirable growth
that's out there that we've seen.
We're looking at probably going in with excess capital on the higher side of that that we
can reserve for future opportunities that we may see come at us in 2022. But in the same
vein, my comments also said that I think given the earnings that we'll be able to generate
off of that portfolio will continue to return capital next year as well based on earnings.

So when you say higher side of that, it's within range of that $1 million buffer?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
Yeah being closer to $1 billion, we'll keep it higher and as we go through the year, we'll
see, will continue to manage that.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay, thanks. And then my follow-up question. You guys highlighted, right, it's been high
cat loss year for the industry, over, if you go back over the past few years, we've heard
that every year just coming across in different ways. Kevin, you said that you're optimistic
for the January 1 renewals, so what's the best outcome, I know we're still a ways away and
things change as we get closer, but just based off of what the industry has dealt with this
year with losses in the US and in Europe, what do you, what do you think happened to the
cat market and what do you guys need to happen for you to incrementally write more
property cat business and return less capital to shareholders?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
Yeah, I think it's a great question. And we're in a period where we don't really have a lot
of price discovery that we could point to, so what I tried to highlight is what I think will be
the drivers that will be resident in the market for us to increase the rate that we get on
the property cat that we take.
I think the way that I would think about it is we're going to have, I believe a demand and
supply imbalance. We've already seen a few large buyers, say they would like to increase
the amount of protection at the purchasing. I think the effect of the reduction in retro, will
have a material impact on reinsurers and their ability to continue to service the portfolios
that they have and pricing is always done at the margin.
So I feel optimistic that there'll be a strong sense and a willingness to reduce risk should
rates not be at a significantly improved level. I mean, I think and I use the term rate, I
should probably say economics because I think we'll also see a shift in attachment points,
Page 13 of 23

particularly in Europe will go up, and we'll see improved terms and conditions, and will
achieve more rates on a rate adjusted basis.

FINAL

I have significant hope certainly in the double digits as to what sort of rate change I
expect.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

And the double-digit in both the US and in Europe?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
Europe is less important to us, but it certainly deserves double digits and we're prepared
to reduce if we don't get it. I think more important in Europe is probably the attachment
point. So if we get the same rate, but on a risk-adjusted basis, to have double-digit
improvement in economics will be satisfied.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay, thanks for the color.

The next question will come from Meyer Shields with KBW, please go ahead.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Great, thank you. I guess the key question is on the Casualty and segment and Specialty
segment, I see you've been very sort of descriptive in terms of the loss ratio
improvement, have you seen any components of losses there or I'm sorry loss trend that
it's getting worse rather than better?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
It's always a bit of a mixed bag on a quarterly basis when you do your actuarial reviews to
close the books. I would say in general 19 and forward looks pretty good, 18 and prior is
where there is more challenge in the book. The good news for us is our book was
growing and we knew at the time we were investing into a market that we expected to
improve.
So the biggest portfolios that we have a really 2021 and expect to be 22. So the balance
of our portfolio, I think is in significantly better shape than others. What we are seeing in
our portfolio will be pretty consistent with what others are seeing because we're writing a
proportional book.

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay, that's helpful. And I just wanted to get your perspective on development in Florida, I
know you've been fairly pessimistic about what's been accomplished so far and I was just
hoping for an update?

FINAL

A - Kevin O'Donnell
Yeah. Florida is Honestly, not on our radar screen just yet, just because it's, as you know,
it's a mid-year renewal. What we've done in building our pro forma is to hold our PML and
Florida flat for 2022. That's easily adjustable as we begin to learn more at the one-one
renewal and transfer that into what's likely to happen at 6.1 and 7.1.
Florida is locating one of the markers, I generally look at to see the health of the market is
to see the growth in Citizens, Citizens continues to grow, which often is a sign of stress in
the market. So the fact that the market's stressed, there might be an opportunity for
there to be real legislative change that is beneficial and reinsurers are probably going to
continue to look for rate.
So, we've got great relationships down there, we have pulled back over the last several
years, but I don't feel impeded, should we decide to grow.

The next question will come from Brian Meredith with UBS, please go ahead.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yes. Thanks. Kevin, a couple of questions to your first just curious you gave us to $29
billion PCs loss event, what's your view of what the Ida losses for the industry, and how do
you factor in demand surge to that given the inflationary environment?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
So the $29 billion is probably a reasonable estimate, not including and [inaudible]. So I
think from that standpoint our loss numbers are always a little bit different than where PCs
is. I think the important thing to note is we did include inflation, social inflation, and
demand surge in the number that we put up for Ida and for Burn[ph].
So our numbers reflect our best estimate based on the energy of the Ida loss and the
environment in which it incurred which is with inflation, social inflation and of course,
demand surge.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you. So your number would be probably higher than PCs given than inflation?

A - Kevin O'Donnell

FINAL

Yeah, I would say that's probably a reasonable estimate. We don't disclose industry
number on that, more importantly, wanted to get the number that affected us?.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Makes sense. And then my second question, I'm just curious, you made the comment that
you're likely to kind of repurchase shares or your capital management in line with your net
income that you're generating, but you haven't generated in any income over the past 12
months, does that basically imply if fourth quarters zero for some reason the cat, I'm sure
you would be buying back any stock?

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

I think we're going to take in each quarter as it comes, Brian. The question is really
presented, like Kevin said we've reached a competitive scale, we feel good about the
portfolio that we built. And as we look at 2022, we're going to go in with some excess to
buffer that probably at the high side, I said so it does give us capacity to continue to pull
all the levers in our capital management portfolio.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kevin O'Donnell
Brian, I think Bob's absolutely right. The most important thing for us is to maintain a
fortress balance sheet and liquidity to pay our losses and have capital available, should
there be opportunities to grow. We will maintain all of that in 2022 and it's still have room
to purchase shares back should we have normal cat activity.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Makes sense. Thank you.

The next question will come from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research, please go
ahead.

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Hi, thanks. First question, following up on some of the capital questions. I'm just trying to
understand, I guess where the excess is coming from, because if we go back to the
capital raise last year, you raised a bill. So it didn't seem like you had that much excess,
then you said, you deployed all of it earlier this year, and now there's less equity, there's
less capital than there was before the capital raise. So, I don't know the right way to ask
the question, I mean, what was your view of excess, maybe after the capital raise last
year? I'm just trying to understand where the excess is coming from.

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

FINAL

No, that's a good question for clarity. Now, we entered COVID with surplus capital, we
talked about that. So as we looked at the capital base, we were looking at the context of
the uncertainty that we faced with COVID, and we still have that uncertainty out there.
So in the second quarter, we also saw enormous opportunities to continue to grow into
the business. At that point in time, at the end of Q1 is when we were starting to think
about raising capital. That's my reference point off the $6 billion and $3 quarter-billion, but
I'm talking about on a comparable basis. Subsequent to that we generated significant
earnings on the portfolio that came through an unrealized gains and losses, in this case,
they are mostly gains that came through, that I talked about last quarter. That's straight
common equity, it comes into the capital from our capital standpoint perspective.
And as over time, and that crystallizes, we're able to return that and still maintain the
adequacy of capital that we needed as we look into 2022. So we feel comfortable about
it, we feel comfortable for the reasons that we started about, but that's kind of the
reconciliation in terms of earnings, if you're looking back where it came from. What it's
also provided us with this, our premiums have gone up by $1 billion in our capital is the
same. So it's also reflecting the premium leverage that we have now embedded in our
portfolio going forward in areas that we talked about.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Got it. And then I guess for Kevin. I just thought it was interesting that you said the vendor
models for hurricanes are actually below your internal view for the past five years, which
would seem to indicate that perhaps you've been over earning relative to expectations.
How do we reconcile that I guess, with the property cat loss ratio has been I think about
80% since 2017, we should see the indicated a lot more rate need and I think you said for
Economic needed, a lot more than just double digits for this business to be attractive to
right?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
So our view of risk being higher, I think is a demonstration of kind of our commitment to
being good stewards of capital and being kind of superior in risk selection.
We effectively, what that would mean is we are holding the same deal at a higher loss
ratio and a lower expected return than someone using a different model. That to us is the
right way for us to look at the business because it appropriately states our profit rather
than overstating our profit.
And more importantly, it allows us to build much more detailed EP curves, to understand
the use of capital and our capital management, their benefits from having a view of risk
that we feel reflects climate change and that we have confidence in.
So when I think about where the model is, it's we someone should be in thinking about
this risk and not have rose-colored glasses about the return that they hope to achieve,
but reflect the reserve that they're likely to achieve due to the effects of climate change.

FINAL

The other thing that I tried to highlight in my comments is, there's also, against the model
that we have, statistically we are above the arrival rate for large storms compared to what
our model would predict, which we believe is a normal statistical anomaly, just like we saw
prior to Irma.
We are still within a confidence range about the 75th percentile unexpected returns for
our portfolio against the heightened average, so I still feel good about where we are, but
we are in a period of climate change adjustment that's required, but also a statistical
increase in arrival rate which should revert back to its norm.
So I feel like we've done a good job on thinking about the models and reflecting it, and
we've tried to demonstrate that with the transparency on the call today.

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Got it. And then just one more, just kind of information question, two parts. First I guess
for Bob, on Da Vinci[ph]management fees, sounds like there is a high watermark, do you
have an expectation of how much management should be depressed over the next few
quarters? How far are you from getting that back to positive P&L?

Bloomberg Transcript

And then another one I had for Kevin separately is, for something like Ida, what is your
level of certainty around what your losses, at this point? It happened a month and a half
ago, I'm just curious, how much do you, when you think about your loss estimate, how
much of that, is that pin down a month and a half after the event?
Thank you.

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

The management fees will restart next year. It's a quick turnaround, I mean they get
suspended for the year, when they go negative and then they will restart next year and
that will reset the market as they go forward.

A - Kevin O'Donnell
Separately, I anticipate that DaVinci. It will be a little bit larger next year, which should
benefit where we are, the fees that will generate out of that. With regard to Ida and
uncertainty, well, I think we have a really strong process and thinking about, we've talked
about before the bottom up and top-down approach to loss estimation.
It is early days, I think COVID and some of the supply chain and inflation uncertainty and
labor shortages adds a high degree of uncertainty to any lost estimate in this
environment. I believe that, that will be particularly visible in some needing to increase
their European flood loss. I think we've done a better job than others in reflecting these
variables, but I, perfectly candid, I think there is uncertainty in the general macroeconomic
environment that could affect this loss, we've done our best, I think it's the right estimate
and I feel confident in it.

The next question. The next question will come from Josh Shanker with Bank of America,
please go ahead.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Yeah, good morning everybody. I'm just a little worried about Lucy and the footfall a little
bit, it feels like we've had a year like 2017. Yes, property pricing was up but interest rates
were down and the ILS money and the pensions, were really happy to participate. I
thought it was coming in 2021 as well. Can you talk about your confidence in some ways
that one of the stopgaps is the wide participation of ILS money isn't going to be as
enthusiastic about participating this coming year?

A - Kevin O'Donnell

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, I think it's, you raise a good point where there has been more persistence in some
of the ILS money than we originally expected. We enjoy great relationships, and we have a
different platform than others. I think if you look back, there's been several large ILS
managers that are not going, going forward, compared to 2020.
I think that plays a role. I think the role of retro, I think retro funds, if appropriately
managed will have 70%-80% dropped or lost, that's another very difficult year to explain
to investors. So, I frankly, I believe we will shrink our Epsilon portfolio. The good news for
us is we [inaudible] to restructure those deals, so that they more comfortably fit within
RenRe Limited and DV, so that we can still manage them on our platform. So I feel as if it's
just, it's another body blow to the ILS market with the enhanced volatility that this year and
also the fact that a lot of it will shift to the retro market. The burnt[ph] is even higher, I
think about 75% of the burn[ph] loss will come to reinsurance and that will way make its
way into retros as well.
So, I don't feel impaired or encumbered in our ability to access capital, and I think it's
because of our track record in our unique structures. So, what I'm saying is an industry
phenomenon, not a RenRe phenomenon, but we could be wrong and capital could come
flooding in, but we haven't seen that as of yet.
There are some capital raises is going on in the industry, which gives some transparency
and it's our expectation that we'll probably increase our capital managed under the Da
Vinci platform at least for sure.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

And okay, thank you for all the clarity. And then just housekeeping item at the beginning,
Kevin, you said that the loss ratio improved 300 basis points in the Casualty business, I
just trying to, what time frames are you measuring that to me, and what, and when did

Page 19 of 23

the, you go through the gate I guess that told you was the right time to take the lower
loss pick?

A - Kevin O'Donnell

FINAL

So, that'll be on an earned basis, and it's the current year accident expected ultimate that
I'm talking about.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

For full year 20, for full year 21?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
From this quarter forward.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

This quarter's forward, okay.

A - Kevin O'Donnell
So it's more of a 22 issue earned partially in 22 and 23.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay.
And what was the event that transpired that now is the time in 3Q 21 that we feel we have
enough information that we can take that down a little bit?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
It's actually not an event, it was our normal process to go through the curves and it's the
fact that we're beginning to have enough maturity in certain years to begin to reflect the
trend that we are already observing, but haven't reacted to.
So I've talked in previous calls that there has been a gap in what our underwriters believe
the profitability of the portfolio is, and the conservative nature of the actuarial process to
reflect positive trend more slowly, that's all it is. It's a normal, it's the normal delay in
recognition of casualty, profitability in a improving market.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Okay. Then, that's perfectly complete. Thank you.

The final question is from Jimmy Bhullar with JP Morgan, please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Jimmy Bhullar

{BIO 4278955 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. So first is the question on buybacks and you've been fairly active, then I
think you started a little bit after you read equity, but you've been fairly active with
buybacks. To what extent is it that you have extra capital and do you have an inability to
deploy that the returns that you would want versus maybe the stock price being
depressed and trying to take advantage of that?

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

I think we started buying back in the first quarter slowly, $175 million, I think $172 million
actually, and that was after we saw the accumulation of some mark-to-market gains,
actually fortified our capital base. And then my comments, I was talking about, and I think
Kevin was to, we see the opportunities in 2022 and that's what we're focused on. In the
context of 2022 and the growth that we're seeing there, we will have excess capital going
into it that we keep for potential deployment into profitable business opportunities that
we'll see come over the course of the year.

Bloomberg Transcript

But we will have excess capital and we will be generating earnings in the fourth quarter
and carrying it into the first quarter and that will be the baseline that we were looking at
returning if those opportunities potential.

A - Kevin O'Donnell
Bob's absolutely right. And I think you presented it as an either-or, we've actually done
both. We've grown our portfolio, increased of efficiency of the portfolios that we're
managing, and have continued to buy shares back. So I feel great about that.

Q - Jimmy Bhullar

{BIO 4278955 <GO>}

Okay. And then on inflation, to what extent are you assuming sort of continuing
continuation of the uptick in inflation we've seen in your pricing versus may be viewing it
as somewhat transitory?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
We've always had inflation. I think in other times we call the demand surge that after an
event we see that will be increased competition for labor and resources. We have
increased, that and the good thing is when an event happens, we can kind of adjust it in
the moment.
Our belief going into 2022 is we're going to continue to see demand surge, of course,
we are continuing to see the effects of social inflation. One of the tricks is to determine
whether 2020 was a pause or a change in behavior, we believe it's probably more of a
pause, because of the slowdown in the courts and we believe inflation will play a role, and
more importantly the competition for labor.
Page 21 of 23



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2021-10-26

So we're going in with less than a rosy picture to the economic backdrop to which losses
will be settled, and that will be included in our modeling and thinking about how to price
transactions in 2022.

FINAL

Q - Jimmy Bhullar

{BIO 4278955 <GO>}

Okay and then just lastly, you mentioned a few of the reasons you're optimistic about
pricing in your opening remarks. I think some of those reasons existed last year or this
year as well, yet, it seems like, while prices were up, they weren't up as much as people
were expecting going into the year, so what's, what gives you more confidence, are there
things that are different as you see them in the market now versus maybe a year ago?

A - Kevin O'Donnell
So, it's a good point. I think it's just the persistence, it's another difficult year for ILS capital
for retro. I think there is a total change in how primary companies are seeing volatility, how
they're thinking about the impacts of the increased price of their housing stock and the Tsi
values that they're ensuring.

Bloomberg Transcript

I just think it's not a single thing, it's just, in some ways, just the straw that broke the
camel's back where I think there is finally going to be resolved to rise-- to raise prices.
We've seen good rate change in every line, other than property cat and we've talked
about it being an insurance lead pricing hardening, I believe that we're coming inm where
reinsurers are going to have some price, pricing power and some, and some control of
terms and conditions that will be different than what we've seen in the last couple of
years.
It's difficult for me to put a confidence level on it, but I feel that through the conversations
we have with brokers and clients that there is an expectation that they're going to pay
more.

Q - Jimmy Bhullar

{BIO 4278955 <GO>}
