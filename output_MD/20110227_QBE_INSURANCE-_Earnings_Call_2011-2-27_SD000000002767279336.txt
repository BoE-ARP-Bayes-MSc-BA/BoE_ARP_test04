Presentation
Neil Drabsch

{BIO 2093435 <GO>}

Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I would like to welcome you to QBE's 2010
announcement of our annual results. The presentation this morning will be webcast and
live. Just for those that are listening into the webcast there's one small technical problem,
you won't be able to see Frank speaking but you'll hear his voice and you'll see the slides.
Following the presentation and online we will have a full video recording of the session for
those who wish to look. With that understanding that this is a live call and when questions
will be asked at the end if you would kindly put up your hand and a microphone will be
made available and also could I ask that mobiles be switched off. With that I'd like now to
introduce our CEO, Mr Frank O'Halloran for the results presentation. Thank you.

Frank O'Halloran

FINAL

Today I don't think we'll be getting any surprises on the results because we've already
announced them on 4 February but I think what the market does want is some clarity on
the numbers and in particular our outlook. Not for growth because we've locked in a
substantial amount of growth for 2011 in particular. The clarity really is around guidance or
our target of 15% to 18% insurance profit. So in terms of an overview of the past 12
months strong underwriting profit with premium growth ahead of target.
All our divisions in great shape and at the back are the slides that are being presented to
the market is a slide as an attachment which gives our underwriting results over a number
of years from each of the divisions and I think you'll see the consistency in our
performance. Lower investment yields affected the 2000 margin and I'll give a fair bit of
detail on that. A strong balance sheet, with lots of flexibility for further growth. Acquisitions
in 2010 and 2011 to date expected at over $3.4 billion in gross written premium for a full
year.

Bloomberg Transcript

We have new comprehensive global reinsurance program in place, substantially locked in
for 2011 to 2013 at a lower cost and I'll provide some of the benefits and hopefully answer
some of the questions that investors and analysts raise at the end. The dividend has been
maintained. That was confirmed by the Board this morning at $0.66 per share franked at
10% and we have a positive outlook supported by our acquisitions expected to improve
combined operating ratio and an increased yield on our cash and fixed interest securities.
I won't go through the results in detail but a 21% growth in top line, 19% growth in our
technical results in the underwriting profitability offset by lower investment yields and our
lower average for the period we hold the premiums and more about that in a few
moments.
In terms of our score card I won't go through that in detail but obviously we are ahead of
target on the top line, behind target on the insurance profit and just better than target on
our condition expense ratio, our capital adequacy including the underwriting of the 2010
dividend ahead of our 1.5 times; and excluding that underwriting dividend ahead of the 1.5
times. All divisions delivered a strong underwriting profit and return on allocated capital
above our minimum 15% ROE and when I mention allocated capital we allocate capital to
each of the divisions at the beginning of the year based on an A+ S&P rating.
Our underwriting profit, as I mentioned was up 19%. A combined operating ratio of less
than 90% at 89.7%, it's the sixth consecutive year in a row that we've been below 90%
and I don't think there's anyone else of our peers in the market place can actually claim
that record and when I talk about the market place I'm talking the global market place.
Gross written premium was up strongly and I think it's important when you look at our
growth in gross written premium that we've grown on a compound growth rate at 14%
per annum over the past five years and obviously we're looking at fairly strong growth in
2011.
So strong growth supported by strong underwriting results. Average premium rate
increases up by 2.5% on renewed business. It's above the market average and a bit more
about that later on. Our claims ratio was down slightly from where we were in 2009, with
low attritional claims ratio offset by a higher than normal frequency of catastrophe claims
not experienced since 1999 and of course it's continued into 2011. Insurance profit was up

FINAL

6%. The insurance profit margin, 15%, was below our guidance primarily due to the fact
that our yield on our policyholders' funds was down from 4.4% to 3.3% in the lower
average period premiums are held which dropped from 1.5 years to 1.4 years and the two
of them together adversely impacted the insurance margin by 1.9%.
There's a slight change in risk free rates which gave us a negative impact of .2%. The
large risk and catastrophe claims during the year were 9.5% on unearned premium
compared to 8.6% including 1.2% for GFC claims last year and we also experienced
increased premium taxes in Australia and other parts of the world and additional Lloyd's
levies from the 2009 year which increased the expense ratio by 0.5%. We had a low
release which is very much in line with what we told the market, about 0.4% release from
central estimates and obviously they've had a positive impact on the claims ratio. That
compared to 0.7% the year before.

Bloomberg Transcript

The risk margins in outstanding claims up at 89.8%. I think it's fair to say that they were
bolstered by acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions the probability of accuracy would have
been around close to 86% so you can see we got a good boost from the acquisitions we
made during the year. In terms of some significant items that have impacted the net profit
you will see the lower cash and fixed interest yields impacted profit by $325 million when
compared with last year. We had realised and unrealized losses on our equity portfolio
compared to; $48 million compared to $78 million gains and we had a few other items,
not the least of which was the one off gains that we had in 2009 from the cessation of
the capital hedging and the buying back of our debt securities.
In terms of the underlying business, the underwriting of our business, we are very, very
pleased with where that is heading. You can see from the accident year central estimate
claims ratio this is looking at pure accident year where we look at the claims that actually
occurred in 2010 including incurred but not reported claims and see what's happening to
our attritional and large claims and you will see there that our attritional claims ratio
dropped slightly from 1.4% from 2009.
It's higher than it was at the half way mark but you need to take into account that we
purchase NAU which came into the second half which is a claims ratio which is all attritional
at close to 60% and that was the main driver of the increase between the first half and
the second half. The large risk in catastrophe claims came through at 9.5%, as I mentioned
earlier, compared with 7.4% or 8.6% if you include the GFC claims. It's important to note
there that the aggregate protection we purchased three years ago did not include
acquisitions. So the catastrophe claims on the acquisitions obviously were not covered by
the Group aggregate cover which expired at the end of 2010.
Claim settlement costs are fairly consistent and the discount is up slightly on the previous
year at 3.6% versus 3.1% and that's really due to the fact that the timing for settlement of
our outstanding claims has increased from 2.8 times to 3.0 times, so you multiply .2 by 3%
and you will see the difference arises from that. So in terms of our net central estimate of
claims, as I said we're very happy and you'll see that there's been a slight reduction from
2008 to 2009 to 2010.

In terms of the accident year combined operating ratio you can also see that from 2008
when the accident year combined our central estimates combined operating ratio was
90.5%, it is now down to 88.4% which converted into a contribution to the insurance profit
margin is 11.6%. In terms of the reconciliation to the financial results of our accident year
results we had 11.6% contribution from the central estimate underwriting profit compared
to 11.2%. We had savings at 0.4% compared with 0.7% of net earned premium. We had a
release of discount from prior years and that movement in risk margins which adversely
affected the profit by 1.7% compared to 1.5% in 2009 and 1.3% in 2008.
There's a lot of noise in those numbers in this attachment which we can walk those that
want to go into the detail through at a later date but not necessarily today. The big noise
in our results is obviously investment income and policyholders' funds which as I said
dropped from 6.6% to 4.7%. In 2008 it was 8.2% and if you look at the movement from
2008 to 2010 that's 3.5% movement which is a large part of the drop in insurance profit
between 2008 and 2010 in terms of margin from 19.7% to 15%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Obviously the big question is where to from here? Just before I get into that looking at
the weighted average discount rates for the year, and there were some reports coming
out through the half year from analysts, what we've done here is clarified it. You will see
the Australian dollar risk free rate rose slightly, the US dollar down quite substantially
compared to the end of 2009. Sterling down quite substantially, the Euro up but of course
the Euro impact really doesn't come into play because Secura acquisition was
consolidated from 1 November.
In terms of the impact of the discount movement you've got an impact of minus $25
million on the profit and loss account and an impact of minus $42 million on our risk
margins, both negative. In terms of our investment income it's probably better if I move to
the next slide which is a comparison of the cash rates with actual yields and it's very
important for all our investors in particular to look at the currency mix of our fixed interest
investments and cash investments.
We are required to comply with various regulations around the world which requires to
hold investments in the currency of our liabilities. We also have a policy of matching liability
exposures in currencies with assets of the same currencies. So we must hold US dollars,
we must hold Sterling and we must hold Euro to match those liabilities. In terms of what
would happen if we invested everything in AAA cash we would have earned 1.5% in 2009
and 1.9% in 2010, the increase mainly driven by the rise in Australian interest rates.
In terms of actually what we achieved, we achieved 3.8% in 2009 and 2.5% in 2010 and
basically the major difference was because the yields were not available, the cred
expense blew out in April 2009 as we all know and we were not able to achieve or get
the same sort of yields that we did in 2009. Our target for 2011 is based on our current
portfolio which is a targeted yield of 3.3% to 3.5% and a large part of the increase is
driven by the fact that close to 60% of our fixed interest portfolio is now in quality
corporate paper, primarily financial.

So looking at the first half, second half split and the reason why we put this here is
because there's been a great focus on our insurance profit margin and you will see there
that the split shows that we earned 15.7% insurance profit margin in the first half and 14.4%
in the second half with a fall of 1.3% all driven by the investment yield on net earned
premium. The average premium held, as I mentioned earlier, dropped in the second half
due to the acquisition of NAU country portfolio which has a very short term for holding the
premium but it increased quite considerably as a result of the Secura acquisition and
we're looking at with the Secura acquisition followed by the Balboa acquisition, assuming
it is approved by the regulators, staying around 1.4 times net earned premium for 2011.
So rather than wait till the end we thought we'd take that 14.4% or the 15% for the full year
and look at what it does in terms of a waterfall chart. First of all I should mention that our
guidance for net earned premium is up from 22% to 25% and more about that later
because it is slightly higher than what we mentioned in our announcement on 4 February.
Our starting point for 2011 is 15%. That included 1% for FX gains. Based on the current
yield; or the current fixed interest portfolio we believe the yield will increase by 1.1%
excluding FX gains in 2011.
The impact of the Balboa acquisition is 0.3% and that's assuming an 18% insurance profit
margin on the Balboa business and the reason why it's 0.3% is because the starting point
is 15% and we're looking at the total impact on the Group's business not just the Balboa's
business. The new global reinsurance program where we talked about saving $300 million
in reinsurance costs will have approximately 0.5% impact on our COR. In additional to that
the aggregate covers we purchased cap our large risk and catastrophe claims around 9%
net earned premium. That obviously assumes we don't go through the top of those
aggregate covers in 2011.
So you can see there that a guidance of 15% to 18%. We got some criticism about the 15%
but we felt that it was important that we didn't start off with a base that was higher than
2010. So we started off on a base of 15%. There was no specific reason why we chose
15% other than that was the 2010 number. Remember in that guidance we've given you
we've assumed the full utilization of the 9% catastrophe and large risks claims allowance.
We have assumed no savings on commissions and expenses and we're obviously not
doing a lot of work in terms of synergies. No FX gains in the numbers and no allowances
to changes in risk free rates and no allowance for further rises in interest rates that may
occur or may not occur this year.
So looking at each of the divisions, I won't go through them in detail. Americas
underwriting profit up 19%. Combined operating ratio 89.7%, insurance profit margin
dropped slightly, primarily due to the interest rates and the return on allocated capital at
the beginning of the year was 17.7%. A very important part of this slide is that our average
premium rate increases on renewal business was 1%. Market Scout, which is a publication
in the US was showing minus 5%. So what we're really saying there is we've got an entirely
different portfolio than what Market Scout covers and that's largely driven by the fact that
we have a number of specialized businesses which probably are not included in that
survey.

So be very, very careful when you read about what's happening to premium rates when
you look at Market Scout. We have no objections to what they do because they do it very
thoroughly. Our Latin American division, which is included in the Americas numbers, and
you will note in the end report we actually separate Latin America out from the US. It grew
by 59% to $559 million and you will see from the annual report we're talking about
growing that to over $800 million mainly from acquisitions that we've made in 2010. So
we have a fabulous business in Latin America. In terms of Europe combined operating
ratio slightly down, growth up about 5% in Sterling and US dollars, insurance profit margin
down slightly mainly on the back of interest rates again but a solid return on equity of
22.5% on the allocated capital that we give to our European operations.

Bloomberg Transcript

The expense ratio has got a bit of a noise in there mainly relating to the costs of the
transformational projects that we've got going on at the moment to consolidate all our
systems and to improve our efficiency in our processes and we've bought the
expenditure forward so that we can actually get the benefits sooner than we anticipated
and the additional Lloyd's levies which was about GBP10 million that we had to absorb
during the year. In terms of our Australian operations a fantastic result from Vince and the
team. Growth of 15% in Australian dollars driven mainly on the back of the Elders
acquisition. Premium rate increases and new distribution channels.
Again I point out that be careful about what you read in terms of market information on
premium rates. The JP Morgan, Deloittes survey said minus 1% on commercial loans. We
actually achieved 4.9% on commercial loans, rate increases that is. So be careful about
what you read and how you apply it to different companies. In terms of the insurance
profit margin down to 17%, primarily driven by the fact that there's no FX gains included in
the investment yield for 2010. Return on equity on allocated capital 19.3%, a very solid
result.
In terms of Asia Pacific a growth of 9%, 86.7% combined ratio which is from the 15
countries that we operate in Asia Pacific. A tremendous result. Insurance profit margin up
18.3% and return on allocated capital of 25.2%. In terms of Equator Re, which is our captive
and remember that the captive actually provides reinsurance protections between the
Group's tolerance for risk and the divisions' tolerance for risk, and that's what it does and
the results deteriorated on the combined operating ratio from 88.2% to 90.1% and that's
largely driven by the number of catastrophes and claims they had during the year and
insurance profit margins fell by 17.4% to 14%. Now Equator is obviously a very, very
important part of managing the Group's aggregate exposures to catastrophes, the
maximum event retention and the relationship between the divisions and the Group when
it comes to, as I said, tolerance of risk.
In terms of capital adequacy you will see there that we show 1.6 times including
underwriting of a dividend or 1.51 times excluding the underwriting of dividends. We have
$2.2 billion of excess capital or in fact $2.7 billion including the underwriting of the final
dividend. In terms of our balance sheet solid growth in shareholders' funds during the
year, improvement in the probability of adequacy of our outstanding claims to 89.8% and
our depth of equity remaining low at 31.5% with plenty of room to move when the market
is right for tier two debt securities.

Our global reinsurance program which we announced on 4 February is unique to the
world. It enabled us to not only reduce the maximum event retention to around 4%
including the recent acquisition of Balboa, that's compared to 4.3% last year, the actual
catastrophe covers and the per risk covers, covers multiple products, it's a single layer. So
effectively what we purchased is two layers for the cats for example, $1.3 billion in excess
of $200 million which is our retention, the $200 million and basically what it means that
we've got $2.6 billion of protection and any time a loss goes above $200 million we claim
against those covers until it reaches $2.6 billion.
Now obviously we never want that to happen, otherwise we're going to have some pretty
unhappy reinsurers but it's a single layer so there's not layering which means that if you
utilize one layer you have to reinstate your covers. We don't have to reinstate our covers,
the costs are all pre-paid upfront. The risk and the catastrophe cover are actually
supported by aggregate covers. In the event of accumulation of individual risk losses
above $400 million we actually get to claim; we've got a cover of $200 million. In the
event of individual risk losses accumulating up to $300 million and catastrophes adding to
that that go above $800 million we've actually got a cover in place to claim another $170
million from an accumulation of large individual risk and catastrophe claims.
The acquisitions at Balboa are not included, the acquisition of Ren Re US was included and
further acquisitions cannot be included unless they are under $250 million in premium. The
pricing has actually all been locked in and the pricing will only move based on what
happens to what they call growth net premium income which is actually net written
premium in our terminology. What the covers have done is they have reduced the overall
expenditure because we do not have to buy a lot of proportional reinsurance. We've
been able to reduce our overall costs by about $300 million and the expected benefits of
about 0.5% on the combined operating ratio but because of the aggregate covers it also
reduces the large individual risk and catastrophe claims to around 9% of net earned
premium.
I'm happy to go through a lot more detail with you. They are very comprehensive covers
but remember that we've already pre-paid our costs and we've also locked in our pricing
for 2012 and 2013 for over 80% of our covers. I think I should say at this point in time and
maybe I should mention in respect to this slide, is an update of the market on the storms.
Now cyclone Yasi, there's a lot of noise, it could be regarded as two losses by the market
particularly as most of the reinsurers and most of the brokers are saying the storm that hit
Victoria was the second loss. We've counted it here as one loss. The US winter storms
that you saw at about $10 million, Queensland storms about $100 million and we've put
the maximum net loss from the Christchurch earthquake, although it's very early days, at
$175 million.
So as at today's date, the end of February, we utilized $385 million. On the right hand side
you will see that 9% of net earned premium included in our COR is $1.3 billion and we
have aggregate cat and risk covers of $350 billion. So we've actually got an allowance of
$1.65 billion including our reinsurance protections for large risks and catastrophe claims in
2011. I think the important point is that there's been a lot of noise in terms of talking about
what all this means. All I can say to you there isn't a reinsurer out there who is not burning
and not thinking through what its strategy is going to be for Australia and New Zealand. So

be prepared for pretty tough terms and conditions and pricing and higher deductibles
coming through from reinsurers and some of them may not even want to reinsure
businesses in Australia or New Zealand.
The good thing from QBE's point of view is we have locked in our covers for the next
three years and as I said our pricing. Obviously a lot more is going to be said about this as
time goes forward but the reinsurance market has taken a hammering from Australia and
New Zealand in the past 12, 18 months and probably two years now, two and a half years.
In terms of our acquisition strategy we made over 48 acquisitions between 2005-10 and
two this year. The growth in top line has been 90% of which just over 90% has come from
acquisitions. It is probably more than that now but at the same point in time we've been
able to grow our underwriting profit by 90%.

Bloomberg Transcript

So we're actually squeezing the same level of underwriting profit out of the business out
of the acquisitions that we did out of our business that we had in 2005. Our insurance
profit has grown by 73%. Obviously a difference between the 90% and the 73% are the
lower interest yields that are currently prevailing. We still have a number of acquisitions
that we are considering. Obviously more about that at another day. In terms of the
acquisitions I won't go through in detail there but you can see we've listed the acquisitions
that we've made in 2010, the largest one obviously being the NAU Country, the US multiperil crop insurer and more recently the Balboa transaction and then followed by the
Renaissance Re US.
What we've done now in the US is we've actually built our business so that 75% of our
Americas business is now specialist business and 25% is subject to the same sort of
business that Market Scout refers to. So it's been a deliberate strategy of QBE's, to get
into the specialized segments where there's fewer players. We've got quite substantial
market shares, particularly in lenders-placed insurance and crop insurance now and the
specialty program business. So we're very pleased where we're placed in our US business
and we're very pleased with the results that are coming out of those operations.
In terms of the Balboa distribution agreement and portfolio transfer I won't go through
too much in detail. The important point is that the acquisition of Balboa does contribute
$200 million to our maximum event retention but including that there's still 4%. So you can
actually see what we really did with the global reinsurance program, the unique program
that we purchased, in terms of driving down the MER and of course, as I said, the Balboa
transaction basically doubles the number that we had after we purchased that contract.
We do mention there the estimated annualized insurance profit margin of 18% to 20% but
that is after an accelerated amortization of the $700 million consideration and after an
allowance for catastrophes that may or may not occur.
In terms of the outlook we've slightly upgraded our gross earned premium growth and
net earned premium growth and we call it gross earned premium here because what will
actually happen with the Balboa transaction is because there's a portfolio transfer $900
million of that portfolio transfer will be counted as gross written premium in 2010 but it
won't affect the net earned premium. So it's a quirk of the accounting standards. So we're
focusing on gross earned premium, 19% to 22% growth. Net earned premium we've
pushed that up slightly to 22% to 25% and that's following a detailed review with Steven

Burns and Vince, Mike Goodwin and John Rumpler last week in terms of where our
numbers are after the December and January renewals.
Our reinsurance expense ratio around 12% and obviously if we do have some
catastrophes, not on the worldwide programs but in terms of our reinsurance sitting at
1036 and the ones that are not covered by the worldwide program. That reinsurance
expense ratio is subject to reinstatement premiums. A combined commission expense
ratio of 31%. Now, that's up from where we are at the moment, and that's driven by the
Balboa transaction, particularly the amortization of the upfront $700 million payment
consideration.
Insurance profit margin of 15% (sic; see press release) to 18%. I hope that everyone found
that (inaudible) chart helpful in terms of describing how we got to that range. Tax rate,
around 23% and a gross investment yield, which is based on our current portfolio. It
doesn't include any allowance for FX gains of 3.3% to 3.5%.

Bloomberg Transcript

In terms of what does this all mean, and I know there's a fairly substantial range in terms
of our insurance profit, but the reality is we're saying our minimum growth and net end
premium is going to be 22%. It could be as high as 25%. Obviously, if you take an
insurance profit margin of 15%; that's what we achieved last year; and we grow by 22%,
our insurance profit, in dollar terms, will grow by 22%.
Of course, if we've got 25% growth and a 15% insurance profit margin, we actually grow
our insurance profit by 25%. If you go to the middle of the range or, say, around 17%, we
get very, very significant growth in our insurance profit. At 17% and 22% growth in net end
premium, our insurance profit will grow from $1.7 billion to $2.35 billion, which is very, very
significant indeed.
Please remember that we haven't made any allowance for potential rises in interest rates
that may occur or may not occur this year or next year in the US and UK and Europe. In
terms of our performance, it's interesting; having a look at the combined operating ratios
of many of our competitors around the world, and you can see from there that the market
is getting close to 100 in many places or over 100; the key for us is to continue to look at
all our key profit drivers, look for acquisitions, look for ways and means to make the key
(inaudible) and combined operating ratio less than 90% because, obviously, as you are all
aware, it's a key driver of our share price and our insurance profit margin.
So in summary, we're expecting around 2% increase in overall average premium rates on
renewed business, and that excludes our specialized business. We haven't included crop
or lenders' mortgage or LMI in those numbers. We've got some synergies coming
through from expense and claims initiatives, particularly in 2012/13 where we're saying, in
Europe, that we're looking at a 2% reduction in the claims and expense ratios from
efficiencies in 2012 and in Americas, we're saying 3% in 2015.
I've talked about the forecast investment yield. We do have increased exposure. I think,
Neil, it's grown from about 35% to 57% in terms of quality corporate paper, and that will
improve our yield. We will maintain our focus on a successful strategy of growing by

acquisition. We are always looking for acquisitions so the EPS accretive in year one. We
have not reduced our minimum requirement from all our products and all our divisions at a
15% return on the capital we allocate them.
The new reinsurance protections came at the right time, and took about five or six
months to negotiate, but we did get them off the ground. We do have substantial
allowances remaining, even after the first two months for large reaching catastrophe
claims this year. Our insurance profit, even at the current level of 15% will grow by 22% to
25% next year. When you add all this up, all the work we did last year, in terms of
acquisitions and new initiatives that were announced, over the next three years, we're
expecting those acquisitions and initiatives to add $600 million to our net profit after tax.
That's it from me, so I'm more than happy to answer questions so thank you.

Questions And Answers
Q - Andrew Cannon

{BIO 16402861 <GO>}

Hi Frank, Andrew Cannon of Merrill's. The attritional loss ratio in the second half of the
year lifted around 2 points on the first half of the year. It was a little surprising in the
context of the acquisitions which came through the NAU acquisition, in particular. I thought
that would go down. Can we talk about the trends, please?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Frank O'Halloran
Yes. The NAU acquisition gives us a 60% claims ratio. Now, that's counted all as attrition so
that impacted, I think, about 5.7 or 5.8. The rest is a little bit of noise between the first half
and the second half. If you look back at 2009, first half and second half, you've got the
same scenario, Andrew. We're very, very happy with 50% now that; the recent acquisition
of Balboa will, obviously, drive down the attritional claims ratio. I think in these numbers,
you'll see that we're actually targeting a 49% attritional claims ratio in 2011. It's a bit of a
noise from the acquisitions, moving the numbers around.

Q - Andrew Cannon

{BIO 16402861 <GO>}

Sorry, is there some seasonality in that as well because, again, the first half seemed
(inaudible) last period as well.

A - Frank O'Halloran
Not in the attritional claims ratio for Balboa but, obviously, the catastrophe exposure
comes in from 1 June to the end of November. In terms of seasonality on attrition, I doubt
it on the Balboa. Basically, what actually happens in these; and we do the same in Sterling;
what actually happens is we actually conservatively reserve for claims in the first half with
some allowance for catastrophes in the second half.
There may be a bit of noise in that but if there are, we'll actually split Balboa's numbers
up, when we come to the half year, between attrition and large risk in claims cap
allowance.

Q - Siddharth Parameswaran

{BIO 15037291 <GO>}

FINAL

Hi Frank, Siddharth Parameswaran from JP Morgan. A couple of questions if I can. Firstly,
just on the probability of adequacy which arose over the half. I was actually expecting that
probability of adequacy to rise because of interest rates rising. You mentioned that there
was a benefit from the acquisitions as well. Could you just comment on how much that
actually added?

A - Frank O'Halloran
Yes. If we didn't have the acquisitions in 2010, our probability of adequacy would have
been just on 86% so that explains the acquisitions. The reason why it's fallen compared to
December 2009 from 88.1%, if you look at the chart on interest rates, you'll see that
Australia is up slightly, the US is down quite substantially on a year on year basis and so it
Sterling down quite substantially so that's where the impact.
One of the great things about QBE is we can go out and make these acquisitions, and we
usually find balance sheets that help us from time to time.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Was the impact all in the second half ?

A - Frank O'Halloran

Bloomberg Transcript

In terms of the acquisitions?

Q - Siddharth Parameswaran

{BIO 15037291 <GO>}

Absolutely, yes.

A - Frank O'Halloran
Mainly driven by the secure acquisition.

Q - Siddharth Parameswaran

{BIO 15037291 <GO>}

Right, okay. Just a second question just on --

A - Frank O'Halloran
I should say, Siddharth, when we buy, say, a company in Europe, the secure (inaudible) was
undiscounted claims reserve. With the Euro going from 1.8% at the beginning, a risk free
rate at the date of acquisition to 2.5% of the Euro, it was quite a nice little handy boost.

Q - Siddharth Parameswaran

{BIO 15037291 <GO>}

Fair enough. Just a second question just on Cyclone Yasi. If it was two events, what would
the difference be?

A - Frank O'Halloran

It wouldn't change our numbers --

Q - Siddharth Parameswaran

{BIO 15037291 <GO>}

FINAL

Wouldn't change?

A - Frank O'Halloran
-- because our catastrophe covers attach at $200 million so it wouldn't change the
numbers.

Q - Siddharth Parameswaran

Okay. Thanks.

Q - Nigel Pittaway

{BIO 3406058 <GO>}

Hi, Frank, Neil. It's Nigel Pittaway from Citi. A couple of questions if I could. First of all, just
on the European margin, it's come down from 18.1% in the first half, I think, to 11.3% in the
second half, so quite a big fall there. Can you give us a little bit more color as to why that
occurred?

A - Frank O'Halloran
My guess is that it's all entirely due to the foreign exchange gains in the first half. Neil?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Neil Drabsch

{BIO 2093435 <GO>}

That's part of the test.

A - Frank O'Halloran
The combined operating ratio is slightly down on the first half, I think. I haven't actually got
the detail with me. I can look at the first half, yes, Nigel.

Q - Nigel Pittaway

{BIO 3406058 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Frank O'Halloran
It would all be entirely due to (inaudible). The actual underwriting profitability during the
first half and the second half is fairly consistent. In actually fact, as an attachment here, at a
group level, you'll see that our claims ratio, our commission and expense ratio for the last
three half years, each of those ratios have been within 0.1% of each other over a three
half year period which is, probably, showing the consistency of our numbers.

A - Neil Drabsch

{BIO 2093435 <GO>}

Also, Nigel, you might just look at, I think, the expense ratio would have moved in that half
year. There's a bit of a timing difference when we look at some of the commissions that
we earned on our 386 but that comes in and that was adjusted in the second half.

FINAL

Alright. The second question is on fixed interest securities, short term money and cash
within shareholders' funds. The number there, I think was around about 50 the first half.
It's round about 100 the second half so a huge increase. I know you've had an increased
allocation there. Any comments as to why that leapt so much?

A - Frank O'Halloran
I think, Neil, you're closer to the allocation than I am, but the allocation has been done on
the same basis from 2009 to 2010. Neil, do you want to add to --

A - Neil Drabsch

{BIO 2093435 <GO>}

Well you've certainly got a higher level of insurance funds in the second half with the
acquisitions, and that's the majority of it. The foreign exchange, as you said, was mainly
skewed at the first half and the second half. I'm happy to go through it with you later on,
Nigel. Nothing stands out at the moment.

Q - Nigel Pittaway

{BIO 3406058 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Alright, and then just on slide 13, the movement in discount rates, I mean, if you do
compare those with movement in bond yields, they seem to be relatively modest. I mean,
is there anything to which they're not just capturing movement in risk free rates, that there
is actually a lessening of allowance there that would have allowed you to have discount
rates above risk free rates, or is there anything peculiar in there?

A - Neil Drabsch

{BIO 2093435 <GO>}

I'll probably just talk to that, if you don't mind, Frank. Remember, these are not the bond
yields you're looking at.

Q - Nigel Pittaway

{BIO 3406058 <GO>}

No. I know.

A - Neil Drabsch

{BIO 2093435 <GO>}

These are weighted; basically, on a six month weighting where you work out our liability,
and then match it with the bond rates as they go through and then it weights itself back
so it's an accumulation. For example, if in year 6, you've got 10% of your portfolio then
earning; sorry, go out to year 10, you've got the portfolio earning, say, an extra 0.6% over,
that will multiply by five years. You might add that extra amount to the total. Overall, what
you're seeing here is an aggregation of rates so just be careful you don't look and try and
find a bond rate that matches it. It's all relevant to the portfolio.

It's James Coghill, UBS. Frank, just a question on the year and your premium assumptions
there for '11. One number that looked quite aggressive -- $7.5 billion so if I just estimate
roughly what the acquisitions are adding there and I appreciate you can't comment on this
but it's around $2 billion uplift from acquisitions, so that's implying organic growth in the
order of around 5% for the US and (inaudible) refers to programs that are going to be
cancelled and that seemed a bit high.
I wonder if you could just comment on some of the underlying assumptions in the US -what areas you think might grow and where we're likely to see shrinkage?

A - Frank O'Halloran
Yes. In the Annual Report, there's a breakdown of the $7.5 billion. The $7.5 billion is made
up of $1.3 billion from crop, $1.5 billion from program business, $2.1 billion from financial
institution business, $1.3 billion from regional and major brokers -- that's our winter
portfolio, $800 million from Latin America and reinsurance $500 million. I thought you
were going to ask the question the other way because if you added all the numbers up
and the acquisitions, you actually come up with a figure higher than $7.5 billion but we've
allowed for about $300 million in business to be tossed out that's not meeting our profit
criteria.

Q - James Coghill

{BIO 14006200 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

The one number that's quite tricky to get one's mind around is Balboa. How much
premium comes through at that line for Balboa? Are you factoring in a proportion of the
$1.5 billion?

A - Frank O'Halloran
We're factoring $1.35 billion and the rest of it is Sterling. Remember there's about $700
million of Sterling business that's coming through.

Q - James Coghill

{BIO 14006200 <GO>}

Can you just comment on the tax rates? (inaudible) has been below 24% for a couple of
years and you've got that rising to 23% in your guidance.

A - Frank O'Halloran
Yes. If you do the numbers I'm talking about, you have to understand where profits may
end up. When we add the new businesses throughout the year, the actual number runs
between 23% and 25% based on our guidance, so I think that's pretty solid numbers over
the years. What we're really doing here, if you add up all the various rates, you've got the
US running at 35%.
In the States, we also; for accounting purposes; have to include the tax on the
underwriting agencies, and they attract an additional 6% State tax, so the US rate actually
pushes quite high. US, Sterling at 28%, Australia at 30%, the equated business, there's still
a tax attributed to Australia. The combination of all of those; just doing the sums; runs

Page 14 of 20



Company N ame: QBE I nsurance Group L td
Company Ticker: QBE AU Equity
Date: 2011-02-27

between 23% and 25%. Comfortable with 23%. I think that's probably about the right rate
for your model.

Q - James Coghill

{BIO 14006200 <GO>}

FINAL

Just finally, Frank, could you comment briefly on what regulatory approvals you do require
for Balboa? Just a little bit more color on that, please.

A - Frank O'Halloran
Obviously, the main one is California because that's where Bank of America are located. I
think, George, there's also Pennsylvania which is our main regulator so California and
Pennsylvania. APRA? We've already had long discussions with APRA about the transaction
and the capital adequacy and the impact on the Group. Obviously, we wouldn't have
proceeded if APRA didn't give us an okay to do so.

Q - John Heagerty

{BIO 7044314 <GO>}

Thanks. John Heagerty from Credit Suisse. Just one question if I could. Just on the GWP
growth, you're talking about in terms of acquisitions for the rest of the year. You're saying
that will be funded by retained profit. Just out of expectations, how much capital will be
required behind that on the development of GWP, all within GWP, thanks?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Frank O'Halloran
In the Annual Report, I think we might have mentioned it here. Our forecast, without any
acquisitions for our capital adequacy, is 1.65 times by year end. Each 0.1% is equivalent to
$430 million or $440 million, so if we say there $0.5 billion of capital, that's equivalent to
$1 billion worth of potential growth of we wanted to maintain our capital adequacy just
above 1.51 or just about 1.5.
What we're saying is if we spend some of that difference between the 1.5 and the 1.65 on
acquisitions, we could fund that sort of growth.

Q - John Heagerty

{BIO 7044314 <GO>}

Thanks, and in terms of underwriting other DRP for it to fund future acquisitions, would
you do that if required?

A - Frank O'Halloran
I think that's something I would need to discuss with my Board after looking at each of the
transactions, but obviously we have gone out to underwrite the final dividend primarily on
the back of the acquisitions, but also on the need to have some money in the bank in
case something else comes along in the next month or so.

Q - John Heagerty

{BIO 7044314 <GO>}

Thanks.

Q - Unidentified Participant

FINAL

Japan Bank for International Corporation. Just a couple of questions on your Asia Pacific
business. In regards to your acquisition with PMI in mind, what are the strategies that
you're looking at right now, in Hong Kong in particular, because I know that there's been a
report that you'll be going into the mortgage business?

A - Frank O'Halloran
Yes. When we acquired QBE LMI or the PMI's business in Australia, we also purchased the
business in Asia, in Hong Kong. They did offer the business in Europe but we declined for
reasons that; understand the LMI business in the UK and Europe you know you wouldn't
touch but Hong Kong was an extremely good business. Lenders Mortgage Insurance has
worked extremely well for PMI, that's pre-us, and obviously worked well for the Hong
Kong Mortgage Insurance Corporation.
We have a license in Hong Kong and we are increasing our writings of LMI business in that
market.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Would you leverage that into, say, the China market?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Frank O'Halloran
I doubt it but we're obviously look at opportunities to grow our business in various parts of
the world. We're looking at places like Singapore and other for that market. We really
need to be satisfied that the Lenders Mortgage Insurance is not too dissimilar to what it is
in Hong Kong and Australia before we went into those markets.

Q - Unidentified Participant
I guess my last question is, what is the outlook in India then?

A - Frank O'Halloran
Tough. I think it's fair enough to say that QBE -- and I hope you don't mind me mentioning
some numbers. QBE has had an operation there, a joint venture. We have written $1.6
million worth of business in, what, about 9 or 12 months since starting. It's just so hard to
find business so that you can get the right price and the right terms. We're taking it slowly.
It's going to be much tougher than we first thought but, at the end of the day, we're in the
business of making money on the bottom line, not in the business of telling our
shareholders, look, we've grown by 50% to 100%. Isn't that fantastic? It's tough in India at
the moment.

Q - Daniel Toohey

Hi, it's Daniel Toohey from CLSA. Just a question on the PoA leverage to interest rate

Company N ame: QBE I nsurance Group L td
Company Ticker: QBE AU Equity

PoA by around 5%. Going back 12 months, it was closer to around 3% so I'm just
wondering what --

A - Frank O'Halloran

FINAL

That 5% assumes that it all goes to PoA but if you look at our book of business, just 1% will
improve the PoA by about 3%. I think that's right, isn't it? Yep.

Q - Daniel Toohey

{BIO 16751863 <GO>}

Okay. Alright, thanks.

A - Neil Drabsch

Q - Ross Curran

{BIO 15090587 <GO>}

It's Ross Curran here from Com Bank. I'm just wondering if you could give us your
thoughts on reserve releases -- the potential for it going forward?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Frank O'Halloran
I'll get shot by Blair Nicholls for saying this, but we believe that the 0.4% or 0.3%, anything
less than 0.5% is a realistic number to use going forward. I think you might say, well, if
you're doing all this actuarial work, why does it occur? Well we look at hundreds and
hundreds of portfolios that accumulate into one portfolio when we present to the market.
Just by definition, if you're reserving adequately, you should be slightly in front at the end
of the day.

Your next question comes from the line of Kieren Chidgey from Deutsche Bank. Please
ask your question.

Q - Kieren Chidgey

{BIO 7268946 <GO>}

Hi there. Just a couple of questions. Firstly on the reinsurance costs which increased from
about 13.7% of premiums to 15.4%. How significant were the reinstatement premiums
incurred over the course of the year due to the high large claims in cap experience?

A - Neil Drabsch

{BIO 2093435 <GO>}

Kieren, it's Neil. 0.4% was the figure for the increase. Most of the increase came out of
NAU Country, the crop insurer which, because we deal with the US Government as the

Page 17 of 20



Company N ame: QBE I nsurance Group L td
Company Ticker: QBE AU Equity
Date: 2011-02-27

primary carrier, that was 1.1%. Just that alone was one of the major pushes. You'll see that
NAU; just be careful of what; we'll have to have a look at that as we go through to you
because that can be a variable in years when you've got a higher claims frequency
because of the way we work with the US ultimate carrier.

FINAL

Q - Kieren Chidgey

{BIO 7268946 <GO>}

Okay. And in relation to your ITR margin guidance, I'm just a little bit unclear on what
you're including in terms of large claim and cat (inaudible). You're showing on that
waterfall[ph] build up slide, a 9% inclusion but then on slide 25 of your presentation,
you're talking about a large claim in cat allowance of $1.6 billion which is, presumably, a
higher percentage of NEP. Can you just clarify how we should be thinking about that?

A - Frank O'Halloran
If you go to slide 25, the 9% of net earned premium is our net claims and that totals $1.3
billion. What we're saying is if we had $1.65 billion of claims. Then we'd recover $350
million from our aggregate individual risk and catastrophe covers. Now, that's assuming
that all the covers are triggered. In terms of the impact on the P&L, it's 9%.

Q - Kieren Chidgey

{BIO 7268946 <GO>}

Thank you. It's just the difference between the gross and the net?

A - Frank O'Halloran

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, correct.

Q - Kieren Chidgey

{BIO 7268946 <GO>}

Yes, just the last question. Just on your outlook for the APRA capital changes, obviously
they're still in the process of being changed, but can you talk about where your most
recent discussions were, specifically around the agency intangibles and the asset liability
and mismatch position?

A - Frank O'Halloran
Yes. I think we're still in discussions with APRA. I think the best thing to say is when we
complete those discussions with APRA, we'll let the market know but we're still talking
about it. APRA is well aware that we do have a significant investment in agencies that's
earning us a very healthy profit. At this point in time, there's no allowance for any of that
investment in the allowable capital. I'm not saying there is going to be but we are in
discussions with APRA on that subject.

Brett (inaudible) from BBY. Frank, a question on the acquisitions. The outstanding claims
show acquisitions added, $1.4 billion to outstanding claims.

A - Frank O'Halloran

FINAL

Reinsurance recovery is $190 million at the top of that, yes.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Then the margins are $384 million so the relationship between the net addition to
acquisitions of 1.4 and the margins of almost $400 million is quite a high number. Were
they the numbers that the companies themselves have or have you had a look at their
reserves and changed the allocation between what's a central estimate and what's a
margin?

A - Frank O'Halloran

Bloomberg Transcript

No. Look, well we're dealing with the Europeans. They don't have anything such as a
central estimate but if you look at those numbers, there's 14, 12, there's $190 million of
reinsurance recoveries. We say in the note, there's 11 $61 million of central estimates. To
take the difference, there's about $260 million which means embedded into the secure
acquisitions were embedded risk margins on an undiscounted basis by about $120 million
or $130 million. The actually company had embedded risk margins in its undiscounted
reserves.
Then we have the discounting on the claims which also adds to the margins. Be very
careful about it because the numbers we've got in the accounts, on a standalone basis for
Secura are about 85% probability of adequacy. Of course, then you get your
diversification benefits when you consolidate it all through to the Group. Do you follow
what I was going through then? The consolidated balance sheet you've got there includes
some embedded risk margins for undiscounted claims reserves, and then on top of that,
at Group level, we actually have the discounting of the claims.

A - Neil Drabsch

{BIO 2093435 <GO>}

So when we assess fair value, our benchmark is 85% to 95% so it's got to have at least
85% probability. That's what you're saying. We have time for two more questions. We're
happy to take them from the floor or online.

A - Frank O'Halloran

FINAL

Yes. I think it's fair enough to say that's a Board decision. We're looking at maintaining at
least our 2010 dividend in 2011. Obviously, if we were able to achieve an insurance profit
closer to the 18%, we'd review that significantly. I think if you look at the numbers, by
maintaining the dividend at last year's level and growth in insurance profit at the low end
of the range, it gives a payout ratio of about 71%. As I said, it's a matter for the Board but
the current outlook suggests that it will be at least the same as the 2010 dividend.

Q - Richard Cole
