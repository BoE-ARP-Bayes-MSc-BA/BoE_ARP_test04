FINAL

Thank you. We will now take our first question from James Shuck from Citi. Please go
ahead, sir.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Okay. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for taking my questions. So, first question
really was around the NatCat PYD that you experienced. So, I think you had four points of
normal reserve releases in the quarter, but you had a very high level of releases from PYD
relating to NatCat. Can you just elaborate a little bit about some of the drivers of that?
Most of the markets have actually seen adverse development and some of them more
recent losses (00:01:38) to hear about that please?
Secondly, I'm not sure you'll be able to answer this, but could you perhaps just give me an
indication of what your capital, your economic capital allocated to NatCat is, and how that
has compared historically over time looking for an actual euro billions number is possible
on that please?

Bloomberg Transcript

Thirdly, just around the North America Risk Solutions business, so the normalized
combined ratio in the period 99.9% I think Q2 and Q3, you've experienced larger losses in
North America Risk Solutions. Could you just elaborate on some of those trends, please?
Thank you very much.

A - Jörg Schneider
Yeah, thank you, James. Good morning. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. First
question on PYD, for basic losses, its 4% in line with our expectation. For major losses, it
was pretty high. It's a broad mixture of events. They range from one-year old to sevenyear old, and I see a long list of items. It's in the ordinary cause of reserve checking here
that these come up and this is due to our perhaps and probably pretty conservative
reserve setting. So, for example, (00:02:57) a little bit for California wildfire, it was a little
bit for New Zealand earthquake and so, and when it comes that is random and now it was
relatively high.
And second question on economic capital, I have to look it up when Christoph is speaking
later on.
And third question is about normalized combined ratio, our normalized combined ratio, if
we adjust for major losses and for reserve releases of basic loss reserve, it is in the order
of 100% and this is some percent – 1 percentage point higher than originally anticipated.
When we look at the reasons (00:03:43) from our plans come from, than it's mostly manmade losses or NatCat losses, more NatCat than man-made, which are just below the €10
million threshold from which we call it a major loss.

FINAL

So, as you can imagine, we intensively discussed it internally. It seems to me as being,
let's say, 80% random and perhaps 20% real underperformance. So going forward, we
continue trusting – continue to be confident that 99% is the current correct adjusted level
because there are also a lot of fluctuations from currency and things like that in it. So, one
should not read too much in that, let's call it miss (00:04:41). So, we are pretty confident
that 99% is the current level and that we are going to improve that. And I come back to
your second question later.

Q - James A. Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Okay, Jörg. Thank you very much.

We'll now take our next question from Vinit Malhotra from Mediobanca. Please go ahead.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning. Thank you very much for your time (00:05:13). So my two questions would
be basically more on the volume side. So, on Life Re, you're getting to see quite a bit of a
sharp fall again in this quarter. Just want to follow up if this is the same mix driver as we
discussed in the 2Q (00:05:33), which was some large structured transactions?
And then on the – on your – just following on this 80% random, 20% underperformance,
please can I just ask is this 20% underperformance coming somewhere from the
structured transactions or from some growth in the broker business or just a bit more on
that would be very useful for us? Thank you very much.

A - Jörg Schneider
Thank you, Vinit. I'll start with your second question. No, it doesn't come from structured
business. It comes from primary insurance out of reinsurance. And for this part of our
portfolio, it is quite normal that they get hit, for example, by tornadoes or so, and these
are not the type of events which then accumulate with the big reinsurance events
(00:06:34) and then we call it a major loss. They are just isolated. If such a tornado hits a
commercial property or warehouse or things like that, it might be a €7 million or €8 million
loss, yeah, so and that is the reason where it comes from and it's difficult to say. I can't be
100% sure where and whether it also has to do with real underperformance or whether
it's just random. My gut feeling is it's more random than underperformance, but we have
a close eye to that.
Your first question about the decline in the gross premium income for Reinsurance Life,
this is foreign exchange effect, €400 million and €1.9 billion of decline on organic decline
and this is exactly how you say this is the same reasons as in the second quarter and that
these are the major structured transactions, which came to an end over restructured. So,

FINAL

no new reason. And overtime, you will see also more large transactions, because they are
still on our radar, yeah. So, this will be – also in future will be a good source of new
business like, also by the way in Q3, where we had various new treaties (00:08:14) in the
UK, also new longevity contract. So, we are still open for that kind of business. It was just
(00:08:24) the two contracts we were talking off and which caused the decline, they were
just gigantic, yeah. So, therefore, it's visible, but it's not a structural and sustainable
reason. Thank you, Vinit.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

All right. Thank you.

We will now take our next question from William Hawkins from KBW. Please go ahead.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hey Jörg, hey Christoph, thank you very much. (00:08:52) the year-on-year experience
for natural catastrophes, because you've had – 3Q has obviously been heavy in both
years, but last year it was monstrously heavy at about 70 points. And this year even if we
adjust for the run-off, 18 or so percentage points could have been a lot worse. So, if
you're thinking about the big decline in those two big numbers, can you give us any kind
of view about how much of this is kind of market related, just that there were – (00:09:18)
was less? How much of this is a share of primary versus reinsurance?
You were just lucky because not much of it hit the layer. And is there any element where
you actually kind of think, well, actually we've just been better underwriters and we've
avoided bullets, or is it all just kind of random? But given that we've gone from 17 to 18
(00:09:34) before the reserve development, how do you kind of audit that improvement
year-on-year in large loss experience?
And then secondly, in ERGO, to the extent you've made this policyholder assumption
change in the German life business, does that have a future impact on earnings as well,
and if so how much? And then related to that given what you've just done for the 2018
guidance for ERGO, how much should we be taking up future years for ERGO's
performance relative to the existing plan targets you've set? Thank you.

A - Jörg Schneider
Thank you, William. Before I hand over to Christoph, let me start with your first question
about the NatCat experience. I understand quite well your reasoning, yeah, and the losses
are always also a result of underwriting, and therefore, if I have huge outlier losses can
also be the consequence of a very aggressive underwriting behavior. I don't believe that
to be the case. The structural changes in the portfolio between 2017 and 2018 are of
minor relevance, and on that occasion, I can also answer the questions from James with
regard to the property casualty risk. On a stand-alone basis, it's €6.3 billion, of which 40%
is basic losses and €6 billion is major losses, and the tendency is slightly up adjusted for
currency.

So, it jumps up and down mostly with currency because there's a lot of foreign currency
yen and U.S. dollar exposure in it. But there's not a strong trend, but a light trend. But it's
not a major development to higher risks. So, therefore, our experience in 2018 with the
large losses is absolutely in line with our expectation for Q3, including the run-off, and I
would also recommend to take the run-off into account because this run-off doesn't come
randomly, but is also a consequence of quite cautious reserve setting and when you look
at our major loss burden for current event, you must see that or you should see that also
together with this positive experience on the outliers of yesterday.
With that to Christoph.

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Thank you, Jörg. Well, thank you for the question. Before going into the question, I just
wanted to highlight how much it is a pleasure for me to be in this hall today. I have been
involved in Investor Relations Security (00:12:31) of Munich Re in the past couple of years
quite often already, and I met many of you before. And I enjoyed it always very much.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, I'm looking forward to seeing you more often in the future, and as I said, I enjoy very
much being already here today together with Jörg, which is a great experience anyway.
Coming to your question now, this is kind of a difficult technical – I'm sorry, now I have to
give (00:12:57) for that. We are talking here about the assumptions, which we use in IFRS
for the distribution of gross profit between policyholders and shareholders. This is at first
step only an (00:13:10) IFRS assumption, which we take. And this assumption has been
devised by the plan and the planning exercise we do every year.
So we look into the profitability of the future, and we look in that plan how much profit we
are going to allocate to shareholders or to policyholder going forward, specifically in local
GAAP, which (00:13:30) the profitability of this book anyway. And there what we saw is
that given now that the risk capacity of companies (00:13:39) increased so much, those
are the – they are much (00:13:44) than they have been a couple of years ago.
What we saw is that the profitability going forward is higher, which will allow us to give
higher portion of the profit also to shareholders going forward. Therefore, we have this
one-off effect now from the change in this assumption, which is based on the future
planning. But going forward, the earnings assumptions are even higher than they have
been in the past and this is exactly depicted in the assumption which we are changing
now. And therefore, I would not expect any negative downturn now from changing the
assumption at this stage is more the opposite that we are able to take this – to have this
one-off effect now in our account is signaling that we are expecting higher profitability
(00:14:24) going forward.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

(00:14:28) I understood that I was trying to ask how much (00:14:30)?

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

How much, you mean, going forward is the positive impact would be on the life figures?

Yeah.

FINAL

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

I mean it's difficult to say. Of course, it's very much interest rate depending and so on.
Rule of thumb would be that – I mean if you've changed the share that the shareholder
gets by roughly 50%, so the increase is maybe max 50% of what we're expecting in the
past. (00:15:07) this translate via very complex calculations into IFRS. So, it's not easy to
really translate it one to one into an IFRS planning, and anyway, it would be too early now
talk about future earnings expectation and we're not giving any new future projections
right now.

We will now take our next question from Thomas Seidl from Bernstein. Please go ahead,
sir.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Yeah, thanks. Good morning. I thought actually you answered the life question, but your
last comment make me come back to this point. I mean on the Solvency II, you're not
recognizing any change that basically assumes you're just anticipating future profits and
although you're saying a 50% in shareholder allocation (00:15:58) legally in Germany,
right? So if you could comment on that.
Secondly, on the equity impairments, can you comment what happened in Q3 and should
we also expect more to come given that actually October was the peak of the equity
underperformance?
And the final question is, maybe a confirmation of my understanding, you had dividend
policy last year, you told us in March normalized results by €2.2 billion, sounds like you're
getting at least 10% increase this year. You paid €1.3 billion (00:16:32) dividend last year.
Should we then all expect a 10% higher, so at least €1.43 billion dividend if this increase in
earnings happens? Thank you.

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Thomas, thank you for asking again, I was not very clear. It is not 50% of earnings the
shareholder gets because this is of course not allowed in Germany (00:16:56) so you're
completely right here. I was talking about 50% in addition of what we had in the past at
Page 6 of 20

FINAL

maximum and this is only back of the envelope calculation given the fact that in the past
for IFRS purposes used as an assumption 10% shareholder split out of the cost surplus
(00:17:14) and going up to 15%, and as I said, this is then completely independent IFRS
judgment (00:17:19), independent of interest rate movements and all those kind of
additional technical effects which might occur. So, really back of the envelope, rule of
thumb, and don't take that seriously at this stage. But,
(00:17:32)
...50% more, sorry.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

And why no impact on Solvency if this is basically also happening in the future?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Well, you could – I mean, you have to differentiate. Solvency, we are very much looking at
the legal entity base, whereas here we're looking at the segment base. On the legal
entity base, we have two carriers in Germany, one is Victoria Life. There, we changed the
assumptions already some years in the past, because the Victoria has been closed the
new business already nearly 10 years ago from now. I believe there will be a change and
will be implemented end of the year, and we are having different cycles timing wise when
to reflect that kind of changes in IFRS versus in Solvency II, but be careful, in IFRS, we have
been much more cautious than the Solvency II. So, the positive impact we are seeing here
in IFRS is relatively seen much larger than I would expect on the Solvency II. Therefore, it's
probably something which will happen at the end of the year, but potentially not even
really visible for you.

A - Jörg Schneider
Thomas, Jörg here. On equity impairment, so the impairments were (00:18:46) pretty
high, but they were not all on equities, but also on alternative investments in one case and
that was quite a substantial amount, yeah. So, we changed an assumption and since it's a
very long-term engagement, therefore we had to write it down. And the impairments on
equities were partially due to the rule once impaired always impaired and partially due to
the rules at six months or 20% rule. And that's – with that, it is also clear that we are
exposed to impairments potentially in the Q4. So, if we do it on today's stock prices, stock
market, then there would be additional impairments but not huge amount, yeah. So, we
can digest it easily.
Second question on the dividend, it's too early now, yeah. So, we never did it that we
predicted dividend level in the quarter of November because we still have one-and-a-half
months to go. And we saw in October already that it's quite a lively natural catastrophe
season, winter storms could be ahead of us. So, therefore, please bear with me that we
don't say anything about dividend. What is clear that with growing earnings, we want to
grow the dividend and but only to a level that where we are confident that it's going to be
sustainable. Thank you, Thomas.

FINAL

Our next question comes from Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Hi, there. I wonder if you could just give us an update on German GAAP profit generation
year-to-date. I'm assuming there's quite a lot of moving parts to do with the catastrophe
losses, but also the real estate revaluation, I'm not sure how that affects German GAAP.
And secondly related to that real estate revaluation, I mean, obviously, you've got an
extra €1.5 billion of unrealized gains. Do you plan to harvest that or what is the kind of
strategy on the large stock now of unrealized gains on real estate?
And the final question, I still a bit confused on exactly what you're saying about ERGO Life
profit in IFRS terms. I think the forecast for 2020 assumed life, I think from health
(00:21:23) breakeven. I guess you're saying, just to be clear now, that it won't be
breakeven now, it will be contribution to profit? Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jörg Schneider
Let me start, Andrew. Good morning. First an update on German GAAP, real estate
valuation is even for IFRS in off-balance sheet item. That means that even on our balance
sheet as investments or other assets, the real estate is at amortized cost, and only as far
as we did impairments in the past, we write it up and that happened by the way, we had
to write the real estate up with a net effect of €100 million under IFRS. That means we
wrote it up in the balance sheet as well as in the P&L. Apart from that, under German
GAAP and under IFRS, it's purely off-balance sheet valuation reserve.
You see it in our disclosure where off-balance sheet reserve on real estate go
substantially up. The number is by the way €1.9 billion gross minus write up is €1.8 billion
off-balance sheet. And if we apply deferred taxes on it then it's on a net basis €1.3 billion
and this €1.3 billion is also a positive economic effect under Solvency II. So, you will see
that and you see it already and this is quite pleasant increase of our Solvency II number in
Q2. It has an impact of 9 percentage points on our Solvency ratio just from this updating
of market value. And...
(00:23:34)

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

It has no effect on the HGB balance sheet, then it's also off-balance sheet from the HGB
(00:23:41)?

FINAL

That is correct. But we can realize it. We can also realize it internally if we want. That
means if we transfer part of that real estates within our group, it wouldn't have an IFRS
impact due to the consolidated view. But it would be beneficial for the distributable
earnings under HGB.
Second important item under HGB is the equalization reserve. After the events of 2017,
we have to refill the equalization reserve and this is an expense of close to €1 billion for
2018. So, this is a very important factor also for the earnings.
But on the other hand, the equalization reserve also make over underwriting result
absolutely resilient against adverse movements in the main lines here. So, it has pluses
and minuses and it has a very important tax deteriorate aspect (00:24:51), which might
become more interesting with rising interest rate. So far with the German GAAP situation,
it's in good order. We have our distribution capabilities. We have additional possibilities to
improve the situation even further. So, I'm not worried about that, but we have an eye on
it.
So far from me, then Christoph on ERGO.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Yeah. Andrew, thank you for the question. Now, I mean the more you dig into that life
topic, the more difficult to get them, sorry for that. This has all to do also with the way we
finance our new business. As you know, we have – let's say, we have two buckets of life
insurance carriers in Germany. We have three of them basically, which we call Life Classic,
which you put into one-off. So, there will be no new business anymore. And then we have
a carrier, which we call ERGO (00:25:55), which is a carrier which will carry all the new
business going forward. And now the one-off we're talking about is only coming from the
Classic Carriers. And as I said, there will be higher earnings going forward, which now are
reflected in this one-off effect, which is also a catch up due to conservative IFRS doing in
the past when we had to increase the wiz capacity of those carriers.
Now what's happening if we close ERGO Life, so one of the Life Classic companies in
addition to Victoria for new business, and therefore, they bring this higher earnings and
therefore we have this one-off there. At the same time, we will have more new business
in the ERGO (00:26:42) Carrier, the other carrier, and there the shareholder will have to
contribute more to financing the new business. And this will offset the higher earnings we
are having from Life Classic to a certain extent. And then, again, very much depending on
volume, on interest rate, on the specific business mix we are going to sell until 2020, and
so we have two effects, one positive one from the classic from one-off companies and
one negative one for the financing of new business out of the ERGO (00:27:12).
And those effects are going to more or less equalize each other. But depending on
volume and size and interest rates, there might be upside or downside. Therefore, I
would say it's too early. I mean the potential there is upside, I wouldn't rule that out, but
it's clearly too early and then would be premature to concretely talk about upside today
and to confirm any higher earnings target of the life for the year 2020 or afterwards. This
now is really one-off coming more from a catch-up effect from in the past, maybe IFRS

FINAL

(00:27:48), we have been more conservative or too conservative compared to where we
stand now. And this assumption we are changing now, we change (00:27:58). Maybe
that's the additional flavor you find interesting.
So, in 2012, we decided to be more conservative and now given the fact that the risk
capacity is better, given the fact that we are no longer having new business in those
companies, we're able to go back to the initial assumption until 2012, and therefore,
nothing really happened. Only in the interim period, we have been more conservative
than we are now, and now going forward, (00:28:23) carrier, which has to finance new
business and there will be an additional burden, which will then overall – most probably will
overall bring us in the position that the cost (00:28:35) can further support our earnings
guidance. Potentially, there's upside, but this is bit premature to go deeper into that.

We'll now take our next question from Jonny Urwin from UBS. Please go ahead.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just one left actually so – just around your
growth profile in P&C Re, I'm sorry (00:29:03) – are you still confident in the profitability of
the growth that you put on in that division? I mean from the outside one could argue that
the underlying performance is struggling a bit as a result. And what's your growth outlook
for 2019 (00:29:16)? Thank you.

A - Jörg Schneider
Jonny, not so easy to answer. First of all, the slight underperformance doesn't have
anything to do with the most recent growth here. It comes from a totally different angle
and totally different part of the portfolio. Our growth appetite is intact, so we want to
increase the momentum of the group, not only to concentrate on risk aversion (00:29:50)
and risk controls, but also to explore new growth opportunities, but not in a stupid
(00:30:00) way or an innocent way. So, it's exactly in areas where we seem to have very
good data and where we know what we are doing, and especially, the structured large
transactions might be a good source of growth where we have a decent profitability. It
could come along with perhaps a little bit of dilution of combined ratio, but only slight
dilution, yeah, because sometimes it's personal lines (00:30:31), it's less volatile than the
NatCat business is for example, and therefore, we can well live with a slightly higher
combined ratio. But if we look at it on economic basis, then this is really well-performing
business and we haven't had bad experience in the last couple of months with it. Thank
you, Jonny.

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Yeah. Hi. Good morning, everyone. So, my first question is on the PYD, so on the cat
losses. And I was just wondering if – it wasn't quite clear to me what drove this – what are
you saying that you found new surplus here or was it a surplus you kind of saw (00:31:26)
existed? I guess, what I'm asking here is whether this contributed to Solvency II capital
generation in the quarter or not?
And then my second question is on the North America Risk Solutions business, which I
think had quite significant impact on the normalized combined ratio. I'm just wondering
what you're seeing in terms of pricing here, if you're seeing rate increases that in
response to the loss experience here? Thank you.

Thank you, Sami. With regard to the PYD for the major losses, I emphasize major, it's not
only cat, it's also some impact from man-made. Did we know about the surplus, not that
we have it always in our sleeve and that we take it out whenever we needed. All these
losses under observation and we tend to be more cautious with bad experience in
comparison to good experience, we tend to get good experience, more time to develop
and the more we get confident, the more we tend to release reserve. I frankly admit that
it was highly welcome in Q3 because we had this strong impact from the major
catastrophes of the quarter and it's fully as to capital relevant. So, we have the same loss
and loss peak and loss estimation under Solvency II as we have under IFRS. It's just the
valuation which is different that is mostly the discounting effect, but these don't play a
major role in these short-term oriented losses, not long tail (00:33:11) business.
And second question on North America Risk Solutions, it's difficult to identify a trend here.
What we do is a broad mix of activities, so it's not to – the biggest part has nothing to do
with the large industrial business, it's a totally diversified portfolio of Hartford Steam
Boiler, American Modern, and other parts of the group. Therefore, they – why do we find
them attractive, because they are somewhat immune from these general trends and are
not fully correlated with the overall cyclicality of business. Therefore, my best estimation is
here that price developments are going sideways (00:34:11) and not upwards here. Thank
you, Sami.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Thank you very much. And so, on the pricing, I just wondered if you could maybe give a
slightly broader picture. Yesterday, at the conference, the CEO of (00:34:34) expressed
his hope, which I think (00:34:38) that pricing would go up a little bit, but any indication
(00:34:44). And on the PYD, I may be wrong, but I think this is the first time I've seen it –
the numbers reported in this way with a NatCat being shown net of a PYD effect. And I
just wondered why this choice, why this change, or is an underlying change, was this – it
seems it's different? I mean – and that's all I can say about that.
And then on the life reinsurance, and so, I think underlying excluding one of (00:35:24),
it's always difficult to distinguish what is and what isn't. You seem to be running already a
bit ahead of the €475 million for your guidance. My guess is somewhere around €520
million, €550 million. With already indications that next year would be better and I just
wondered if you could give a little bit more granularity on that, if I'm right? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jörg Schneider
Thank you, Michael. So, a broader picture on pricing, I can only confirm what we hear from
other sources of the market. It's sidewards movement. Overall, we don't expect a decline
in pricing more or less nowhere. But on the other hand, we hope that the impact from the
NatCat events of 2017 and 2018 will play a role, which would translate into price increases,
especially in the loss affected areas, Caribbean, Latin America, Japan. So, overall, we are
cautiously optimistic. At least the downward trend should come to an end. And also my
firm belief is that the interest rates must play a role. And when we have an interest rate
for 10-year, U.S. Treasury is around 3% then (00:36:48) investors have an alternative and
now are not desperate for going into uncorrelated risks, although the alternative capacity
will remain in place, but not with the strong growth momentum it had in the past.
Second, with NatCat, we always gave the numbers net of PYD, but the PYD didn't play
such a big role as in this quarter. Therefore, we were so vocal this time and emphasized
the strong impact in order not to – let's say, not to underestimate (00:37:32) we had from
the Q3. So, it's important that we also share with the market and especially with our
clients that these were very serious events, and in Q4, we have more of that.
And life reinsurance underlying, that's difficult, what is one-off (00:37:48), what is
underlying. You're absolutely right. It's difficult to distinguish. You always have positive and
negative experience and losses on our business that means also major losses on
(00:38:01) our business. Are we ahead of our target? Yes, somewhat. But business
continues to be volatile on an IFRS basis. And we also want to keep open the option to do
recaptures. They are not recaptures with a major burden for the IFRS reside (00:38:23) in
the pipeline right now. So – or at least I don't know about it, but we willingly accept some
volatility of IFRS earnings to the benefit of the economic position. And I think that will also
be important in future.

The expectation for 2019 going forward, I really don't know whether the new basis can be
higher than the 475 (00:38:56). This is also to do with the fact that the translation from
economics to IFRS is somewhat strange with regard to the locking of assumptions and
unlocking when you reached some trigger points and things like that. So, some of our
peers, and especially, Hannover Re at the Capital Markets Date (00:39:19) has intensively
discussed that and we can only confirm that there's always some artificial impact from this
accounting rules, but we don't have major holes here. There will be issues here and there,
but not to a large extent. And therefore, we are confident that we can grow the
profitability in Life and Health Re (00:39:42).

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just one question for me. So in the statement, you talk
about raising subordinated debt. I guess even with this, given maturity of, I guess, your
existing debt, you have suboptimal leverage. Jörg, if you give some advice to your
successor on how to optimize the balance sheet, what would you say that if he decides to
bring you back to the consultant? Thanks.

A - Jörg Schneider
Yeah. Interesting. Yes. Thank you, Kamran. I don't like debt. I frankly admit that. And
perhaps this is one tiny reason for Munich Re not having an enormous load of debt on its
balance sheet. It has also to do with our HGB German GAAP situation that distributions
must always have an eye on the distributable revenues and revenue reserve, but an
leverage ratio of zero would be definitely wrong, and if we wait for 21 and 22 for the next
quarter dates (00:41:04) for our outstanding subordinated loan, then we would be at
zero.

Therefore, we should have a decent level of leverage, and it's better to diversify also the
issue and repayment date, and therefore, I would very much like to come out with – and
use of (00:41:28) subordinated loan very soon, also to somewhat diversify our refinancing
and to diversify our exposure to markets. The ideal leverage should be most probably
higher than that what we have at the moment. So, to go to moderate levels, which
probably still below the average PA (00:41:53) level, but somewhat higher than our
current ones would be in my view very responsible guidelines, yeah. Thank you.

Q - Ivan Bokhmat

{BIO 15378004 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi. Good morning. I have three questions. The first one is on the underlying combined
ratio in P&C. I mean you're running at around 100% right now. And I was just wondering
whether you have any observations on how the path to 2020, the 97% target is going to
look like or whether the target is still relevant?
And then a couple of questions on the volumes, so, first of all, in the P&C, I mean, we've
noticed that the growth had continued. We're also hearing about large blocks of casualty
business being brought to the market in the U.S. I'm just wondering whether that would
fall within your current risk appetite and whether we should expect Munich to keep
increasing the casualty business?
And then, finally, you did mention Hannover Re and their approach to Life and Health
business. They seem to be giving up some volumes, which may come to the market. I'm
just wondering whether this is also something that you would be ready to consider? Thank
you.

A - Jörg Schneider
Ivan, thank you very much. We look at everything, yeah. But let's start with your first
question underlying combined ratio P&C around 100 path to our, let's say, mid-term path
to 2020 or so, we stick to our financial ambition for 2020, which would be net profits in
the order of €2.8 billion, half coming from ERGO – half of the increase coming from ERGO,
the other half from reinsurance and also still our best estimate for 2020 for the combined
ratio with a slight reservation with regard to business mix effect would be that we can go
down to 97% in spite of our current, let's say, little underperformance that we are not at
99%, but one point higher.
The one point I had explained is more random than structural. That means we need
another 2%. First effect would be expense reduction that is ongoing. The voluntary
program has been finalized with a very good success. So, we could really reduce our
workforce and are currently in the process of reducing the complexity, and I'm confident

FINAL

that this will be a very good move and that we will be able to have a bit more agility also
due to this development.
Second effect is new business deals, which leads to volume growth, which will help to
drive down the admin expense ratio, and perhaps there's a countervailing effect which
could come here and there from the fact that they come along with a higher combined
ratio themselves. Personal lines, a bit more stable business, but I don't want to overplay
that cards right now. So that effect is a tendency, a slight shift from casualty to property,
which had been planned, but and that brings me to your second question, we are open
also to large blocks of casualty business, but we had never erratic changes of our risk
appetite for casualty.

Bloomberg Transcript

According to my observation, we've had a very consistent path with regard to casualty
business, especially also heavy casualty business. So, therefore, we looked with a lot of
expertise which was out there. The big question mark always comes from the adequate
level of reserve, but let me add here our experience with our casualty reserves, I touch
wood now, is very good, yeah. That means that the assumptions of the colleagues in
charge, which are extremely experienced and careful experts had been right in the past
and found to be confirmed (00:46:24), I can't say that for the eternity, but at least the
track record is very good.
So, when we look at these portfolios, we do it with, I think, enough – yeah – how should I
say, common sense plus expertise. Last question on additional life business which might
come to the market, we are also open. We look also at big blocks wherever they come
from. But in the past year also, let me carefully appraise (00:47:00) the track record and
sometimes there were big blocks on the market. And I admit that I asked myself at that
time why aren't we more aggressive couple of years ago with this or the other major
transaction, and they were always reservations, they were always very good reasons in
place while we didn't pick it up at the same price as others did, and it turns out here and
there to be beneficial. So, therefore, I trust that the colleagues will do what they will know
what they do here. So far with that, Ivan, that answers your questions.

understanding is that the costs which are initiated are related to this has not yet been
reflected within your plans, or maybe you could give any further color on this where you
stand and where the project is going with respect (00:48:26) to costs? And related to
this, whether you see still there had been once the decision made that you are not going
to sell your (00:48:34) portfolio, but just would like to (00:48:38) your comments on
whether this is really off the table or you could reconsider to start this?
And then secondly, as we saw (00:48:48) just some cleaning up within your international
business with the Dutch entities, whether you can comment whether there is more to
come on the international side in respect to cleaning up your portfolio there?

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Well, thank you very much for your question. Yes, you're right. We're working on the
migration with a joint venture you know that together with IBM, and I must say we are
making good progress there. So, the project has been set up and people are really
working, and the IFRS activities have been launched. You know this is a multi-year project.
So, no early results to be expected anyway, but now we are up and running and the train
is out of the station. Let me put it that way.
Of course, we would never start an activity like that without having a business case and
planning and knowing the costs and the revenues are coming out of that exercise. So,
clearly this has been incorporated in our plans, and so, I can take any concerns from you
that we did started without knowing the costs or without incorporating them in our plans.
They are all fully included in our plans with an investment phase in the beginning and the
project phase, and then of course on the long term, we will benefit from efficiency gains
out of that activity. So, this is completely included in the plan.
With respect to one-off, as you can imagine, given what I just said, we are fairly busy right
now in our migration project. So, I can say for – at this stage, it's really off the table. We
have been decided to offer that platform and at the later stage also to the market. Right
now, we are concentrating on the migration of our own policies onto that new platform.
So, for now, we are fully investing and fully concentrating on that activity and this is a
strategy we decided to go for and that's what we are implementing right now.
International, you're right. I mean portfolio optimization is an ongoing activity where we
did some steps until Q3, but this exercise is for sure not over now. And so, there are
further activities to come later this year potentially or next year. So, we continue to work
on that. Sometimes you also depend a little bit on market circumstances, regulators,
whatever kind of things. So, recent activity we started as you know when we kicked off the
whole ERGO Strategy Programme, but this is still ongoing and it did not come to an end
until now.
Even for the fourth quarter, it might be the case that there will be some additional
transactions, and if you look at our earnings outlook for the end of the year, which we
increased, you might also see that this increase is not, let's say, the most bullish one in the
world, potentially you could have been more aggressive here. So, we already included

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Michael Hermann Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Good morning. Two questions. Also sorry for that on ERGO Life. You
apparently reduced the policyholder participation in gross surplus (00:52:32) from 90% to
85%. This will definitely get you some negative press (00:52:38) tension, which possibly
comes in addition to the negative press (00:52:42) you received last year regarding a
possible disposal of your (00:52:50). I think also competitors may take advantage from
that. Are you not afraid that this will hurt your new business generation at ERGO
(00:53:01)?
I understand that some of these expenses – that you save (00:53:08) expenses as you
have no new business in traditional life, but you basically give this to the shareholder and
that's possibly also difficult to communicate to the press and to the policyholders. And the
second question, retro protection in P&C Re, how much did it play a role in the Q3
results?

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

Yeah (00:53:33). Thank you very much for the question. It's a great opportunity for me to
reconfirm that we're not doing that on cost of our policyholders what we're doing right
now. But what we do is we change financing streams in between the different life carriers
we're having. You have to consider that in our Life Classic companies like (00:53:52),
which we are now going to finally close for the major block of the new business, that the
cost will be much lower going forward, and for that cost reduction, everybody is going to
benefit, including also the policyholders of course. And therefore, there are offsetting
Page 17 of 20



Company N ame: M uenchener Rueckversicherungs-Gesellschaft AG in M uenchen
Company Ticker: M UV2 GR Equity
Date: 2018-11-07

FINAL

effects. We are increasing to a certain extent the payout to shareholders, but at the same
time, due to the reduced cost base, everybody is benefiting, and for the policyholders,
altogether it should be more or less equal.
So, it's not about taking money away from the policyholders to put it that clearly here and
this is specifically important in the context you were also making with ERGO (00:54:41),
which is our new business carrier, because we want (00:54:45) to have attractive products
and (00:54:47) now has to carry the acquisition costs, which we took out of ERGO
(00:54:57) we have to pay that, that the proportion the (00:55:02) shareholder has to
pay also increases for (00:55:05). So, the shareholder overall is more or less redirecting
financing streams, but not so much taking out more money of the overall block of life
companies if you take into consideration (00:55:19).

Bloomberg Transcript

If you look at altogether, it is not that much of a change. What we did change though is
that we changed the financing flow, that we reduced the acquisition costs in one carrier,
that we increased it in the other carrier, and we balanced the effects for the shareholder
by increasing the policyholder – the shareholder distribution out of (00:55:40). And this all
then translates and changed IFRS assumptions because you said 10% to 15%, we've
increased it, but that's only the IFRS assumption, which is deducted from a local GAAP
planning (00:55:51), which is much more detailed and has much more – that we look much
more into the details also what exactly is happening between policy and then shareholder.
So, this 10% or 15%, as you know, is a very high level picture only of what's really going on
a local GAAP basis in the respective companies. And therefore, I want to also emphasize
again that now the risk capacity of those companies is so much higher that we also
decided to go for that higher (00:56:23) IFRS assumption now, but we only take a change
back, which we did in 2012. And we are back to normal now. It's not that we take out more
money than we would have done 10 years ago. It's only back to normal. It's not aggressive
in any way, and therefore, I would like to reemphasize it's not on cost of the policyholders,
but it's really an activity and the one-off out of the restructuring of our life business overall.

Q - Michael Hermann Haid

{BIO 1971310 <GO>}

And the 2012 – sorry, the 2012 change that was also basically only the IFRS accounting?

A - Christoph Jurecka

{BIO 17223019 <GO>}

This was also IFRS and this was the opposite change, right.

A - Jörg Schneider
And for me, Michael, reinsurance, property-casualty retrocession, that was your question,
the impact on the Q3 result. So, I have adjust for the nine months here or let's – as a rule
of thumb, we see some 1.5%. That is the cost of our retro, and I don't know by heart how
much additional expenses we had from the reserve releases. But what we give here are
net numbers. That means for the losses net, the impact from retro will be minor. It's just
the proportional elements of retro, which is typically coming in form of sidecar, not the
accelerated retro (00:57:59). It's affected with these types of losses. And the impact for
the losses for the reserve release is there will be small impact because the New Zealand

the year-to-date combined ratio of the Risk Solutions business, please? I think that at the

so far this year? Thank you.

Thomas, I don't have it here, but it will be little bit lower than that for the traditional
combined ratio. Therefore, when you see the 97.3% for the nine months combined ratio
