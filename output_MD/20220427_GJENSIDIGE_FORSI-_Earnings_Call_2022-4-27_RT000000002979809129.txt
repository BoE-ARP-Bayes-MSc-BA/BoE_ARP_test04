Presentation
Operator
Good day, and welcome to the Gjensidige Q1 2022 Results Presentation Conference Call.
Today's conference is being recorded.
At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms.Mitra Hagen Negard, Head of
IR. Please go ahead.

Mitra Hagen Negard

{BIO 3974076 <GO>}

Thank you. Good morning, everyone. And welcome to the ﬁrst quarter presentation of
Gjensidige. My name is Mitra Negard and I'm Head of Investor Relations. As always, we
will start with our CEO, Helge Leiro Baastad, who will give you the highlights of the
quarter, followed by our CFO, Jostein Amdal, who will go into the numbers in further
detail. And we have, of course, a lot of time for Q&A after that. Helge, please.

Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Thank you, Mitra. Good morning and welcome everyone. The world has indeed changed
with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, geopolitical uncertainty has risen to the highest level in
decades. It's shocking and frightening to witness an unprovoked attack on a sovereign
democracy country, in Europe in 2022. Gjensidige is not directly impacted by the conﬂict.

FINAL

We have no direct risk exposure in Russia or Ukraine. Our investments in these markets
are marginal, but the volatility in the global markets has, of course, impacted our returns
this quarter.
The conﬂict has added further fuel within inﬂationary pressure that has been building up,
which will also reach our markets. However, as I will comment on shortly, we are prepared
and we are conﬁdent that we will manage this well. Cyber risk has risen in the wake of the
war. We have high readiness to manage this too. Our employees in the Baltics are closer
to the war in many ways. We have established an emergency team in Lithuania, closely
monitoring the situation. We can only hope that this meaningless conﬂict will come to an
end soon. And the meantime, we will continue to focus on taking care of our employees
and customers and contribute to society at large.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let's turn to Page 2 for some comments on our ﬁrst quarter results. We generated a proﬁt
before tax of NOK1,506 million. The underwriting result was the solid NOK1,025 million
reﬂecting strong underlying results. Large losses this quarter were signiﬁcantly higher
than the unusually low levels we have had for many years, among others driven by the
many storms hitting on the market. Both the number and the size of the large claims are
well within what we should expect to occur from time to time. And they are in line with our
risk appetite.
Earned premiums rose by a healthy 8.6% or 9.9% in local currency. I'm very pleased to see
that the continued improving of underlying proﬁtability through both continued strong
growth and very eﬃcient operations. The underlying frequency loss rate improved with 1.9
percentage points. On a combined ratio for the quarter was 86.5% impacted by the large
losses as mentioned. Our cost discipline remains strong, with the cost ratio of 13.9% for
the quarter. We have a good start to the year to deliver on our target of below 14%. The
heavy turmoils in the ﬁnancial markets resulted in the negative return on our investments
of NOK285 million this quarter. The results were also impacted by the remaining NOK800
million in gain on the Oslo Areal transaction. Our return on equity came to a very good
22%. Jostein will revert with more detailed comments on our results for the quarter.
Then turning to Page 3, a few words about our operations. I will start with the inﬂation.
High demand, storing energy pricing and supply disruptions have sparked global
inﬂation, as the consequence, overall claims inﬂation in our markets is rising. However, we
do not currently see any areas of signiﬁcant concern. Claims inﬂation so far has been in
line with our previous expectations as witnessed by our continued strong underlying
proﬁtability numbers. Furthermore, we have not had any challenges related to supply raw
materials or manners [ph].
We continuously monitor the development in close cooperation with our partners and we
are well prepared. As we have said so many times before, this is simply ordinary course of
business ﬁrst. We are conﬁdent of our ability to stay ahead of the inﬂation curve based on
our strong competitiveness, and supplier agreements in Norway with the best terms and
conditions.

FINAL

But, of course, the extent reach and duration of the inﬂationary pressure is uncertain.
Based on our latest and analysis, we expect claims inﬂation for private property in Norway
to be in the range of 7% to 9%. For motor in Norway, we expect claims inﬂation to remain
in the range of 4% to 6% moving towards the upper end at the end of this year. We are all
prepared to handle this and ensure that we are ahead of the inﬂation curve. Hence, we
will raise prices at least in line with claims inﬂation for all products.
The strong momentum for our Norwegian operations continued in the ﬁrst quarter.
Premium growth in the private remained high despite tough competition. We have
managed to continue to put through necessary price increases while maintaining a very
high customer retention. This is a result of a strong oﬀering and very strong brand. We
have recently strengthened our brand proﬁle. Our new tagline no one knows the day
better, emphasize our leading position in Norway. And with deep analytical insights,
which enable us to continue developing safety solutions for our customers.

Bloomberg Transcript

Premiums continue to grow strongly in our commercial segments as well. Volumes are up
and we have successfully put through necessary price increases in a very competitive
market. At the same time, the retention has risen further from over the high level. Going
forward, we will continue to raise prices to reﬂect high expected claims inﬂation and
beyond expected claims inﬂation for certain pockets in the large corporate portfolio. We
expect to be able to put this through.
We had a good underlying performance in Denmark this quarter, adjusting for the high
large losses and absence of COVID impact this year. Premium growth remains high and
operations are strong, we continue to move forward within new core IT system. The
private products are being migrated over to the new platform and the system is
providing, increasing support for our distribution activities. We are also very pleased with
progress in the ongoing eﬃciency program for claims handling.
Further, I'm very pleased to see that our turnaround, its eﬀorts in Sweden are starting to
show results. Operations are becoming increasingly eﬃcient, our portfolios are healthy,
and we are growing proﬁtability. We are in the initial planning phase for implementation
of the new core system in Sweden. This will be a game changer for our Swedish business
too, and the crucial part of the foundation to succeed with our digital transformation. We
are convinced that investments will pay oﬀ in the long run, although, sales in the shortterm could be somewhat impacted.
We have carried out a thorough assessment of our operations in the Baltics, which I will
dwell further into on Page 4. We have started an accelerated transformation program with
the clear focus on three main areas, pricing and underwriting, claims handling, and
organizational eﬃciency. First, we will implement pricing measures on unproﬁtable
products on top of the price increases, we have to do during the past six months. Second,
we will look into pruning our commercial portfolio with particular focus on our health and
motor products. Third, we will improve our claims handling by some gain evaluation of
estimates from workshops and improved steering towards preferred partners.

FINAL

We will also leverage analytics to reduce leakage and we expect to see results from new
fraud systems. And ﬁnally, we will step up standardizing and digitalization of processes.
The latter with particular focus on distribution, contributing to organization and eﬃciency.
We had strong expectations from these actions despite the tough competition and high
inﬂationary pressure also in the Baltics. Our combined ratio shall reach a run rate below
100% in the fourth quarter of this year and continue improving after that. And we will
bring down our operating expenses signiﬁcantly from 2023.
We have a signiﬁcant growth ambition for the medium-term, both for the private and SME
customers. Organic growth supported by good customer experiences and customer
friendly and eﬃcient digital solutions, shall be complemented by a broader reach in this
commercial sector through brokers. And we will continue to seek attractive M&A
opportunities.

Bloomberg Transcript

Then over to Page 5. We continue to make progress on sustainability. We have a number
of initiatives as you can see on this slide taking important steps towards delivering on our
ambitious target. With the EU taxonomy reporting moving closer, I'm very happy to
announce that we have our ﬁrst insurance product to fully comply with the taxonomy
criteria namely commercial building insurance. We will continue to transform the rest of it
eligible products going forward.
Then over to Page 6. A few words about a pilot we will be launching very shortly to
complement our home seller insurance launched back in January this year. We recognize
our customers need to maximize the value of their home before selling. Maksimer is a
ﬁxed price package oﬀering ensuring that certiﬁed craftsman's carry out all necessary ﬁrst
refurbishment in accordance with the real estate agents advise. We solve our customers
problems and at the same time contribute to damage prevention. Our market share for
home selling insurance is around 10% as we speak with distribution to a selected group of
real estate agents. We see a very interesting opportunity in this market and we'll widen
our presence gradually as we gain more experience in this new ﬁeld.
And with that, I will leave the word to Jostein to present the fourth quarter results in more
detail.

Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Thank you, Helge, and good morning, everybody. I'll start on Page 8. We delivered a
proﬁt before tax of NOK1,506 million in the ﬁrst quarter slightly below last year. Premium
growth and the improved underlying frequency loss ratio and the lower cost ratio
improved the underwriting results, but this was more than oﬀset by the -- our aboveaverage large losses. With the COVID restrictions being lifted, we do not see any COVID
impacts on our claims this quarter.
We see solid growth in all segments and improvements in the underlying proﬁtability in
all segments with the Baltics. Also if you adjust for COVID and weather eﬀects last year.
The Baltic results are weak. As Helge explained, we are focused on turning around the
situation there and have set ambitious yet realistic targets which we will actually. Our

investment portfolio generated negative returns this quarter reﬂecting the market
conditions. Our pension business generated a high results. I'll revert on both of these in a
moment. The remaining gain of NOK800 million from the sale of Oslo Areal was recorded
in the quarter underlying other items.
Turning to Page 9. The strong development in premiums continued in the ﬁrst quarter,
with all segments showing good growth. Total earned payments are up 8.6% or 9.9%
adjusted for currency eﬀects. We saw strong increase in premiums for the private
segment driven by price increases for motor, property and accident and health insurance
as well as higher volumes for motor insurance, despite the decline in new and secondhand car sales. We also increased the number of customers. We maintained our strong
market position and competitiveness. The rise in premiums in the commercial segment
follow eﬀective pricing measures, solid renewals and volume growth for the motor and
accident and health insurance products.

Bloomberg Transcript

Cross-selling of pension products is picking up. We are expanding our sales force in
response to this and to further strengthening our position in the SME market. Premiums in
Denmark increased by 11.3%, measured in local currency. This strong development was
driven by volume growth and price increases in the commercial segment. The latter in
particular for workers' compensation, higher premiums of specialty travel insurance, and
the NIM business also contributed to growth. Premiums in the private segment, excluding
them were somewhat lower than the same quarter of last year due to competitive
pressure.
Earned premiums in Sweden measured in local currency increased by 7.7%, mainly driven
by volume growth in the commercial portfolio. Termination of a partner agreement in the
private portfolio in the third quarter last year, resulted in a decline in earned premiums in
the private portfolio. You are happy to see the results of our eﬀorts to increase customer
satisfaction with our sales, service, and claims processes.
Customer retention rose more than 3 percentage points this quarter to just below 80%
[ph]. Double-digit rise in premiums in the Baltics was driven by growth in most times,
particularly, motor and health insurance. Travel insurance volumes also increased
signiﬁcantly, although, they are still below pre-pandemic levels. Customer retention in the
Baltics increased by 1.8 percentage points to 69.6%.
Turning over to Page 10. Underlying frequency loss ratio improved by 1.9 percentage
points compared to the same quarter in 2021. Adjusted for the positive COVID-19 impact
on claims and the eﬀect on claims, of the extraordinary cold winter in Norway, the ﬁrst -- in
the ﬁrst quarter of 2021, the underlying frequency loss ratio improved 0.7 percentage
points. This strong development was driven by eﬀective pricing measures, solid renewals
and good risk selection. Large losses were signiﬁcantly higher than the levels we've seen
for a while and our estimated quarterly average. (inaudible) is in itself not an expected
and it's not a sign of any deterioration in underwriting quality or changing risk appetite.
To give it over enough gains, this brought the loss rate for the quarter up to 72.5%. We
continue to improve our underlying results in Norway and Denmark from already strong

FINAL

levels, and we are very pleased to see that their eﬀorts have started to show results in
Sweden. Although, we cannot rule out some volatility going public. We are convinced
that the measures we have already implemented and our ongoing eﬀorts will continue to
improve results for this segment. The Baltics still have a further way to go and we are
disappointed about the results there. But we're conﬁdent in our plans to change the
course of the segment towards an acceptable proﬁtability, and that we will see the results
of this already during 2022.
Let's turn to Page 11 level. We recorded -- NOK1,067 million in operating expenses in the
quarter. Our cost ratio move further down by 0.6 percentage points to 13.9%. And if
exclude the Baltics, the cost ratio up 13.3% for the quarter. The main driver of this
improvement is premium growth and strong cost discipline in the group. Our low cost
ratio in Norway can fell down by 0.8 percentage points. Denmark recorded a 0.5
percentage point decrease in the cost ratio driven by good premium growth. The cost
ratio in our Swedish business improved by 1.6 percentage points, and the cost ratio in the
Baltics improved by 0.7 percentage points, driven by higher premiums. You see we have
strong potential to enhance cost eﬃciency in this segment.

Bloomberg Transcript

A few comments on the pension operation on Slide 12. The pre-tax proﬁt came to NOK54
million up year-on-year, reﬂecting growth in the business and good returns on the real
estate investments. Assets under management was broadly in line with what we had at the
year end last year reﬂecting development in ﬁnancial markets. Annualized return on
equity was 15.3%. The solvency ratio at end of the quarter was 169%. So far the
introduction of individual pension account has not let any signiﬁcant change in the market
dynamics. It is prudent to expect some pressure on our proﬁtability, in the short to
medium-term.
Moving on to the investment portfolio on Page 13. Our investment portfolio generated a
return of minus 0.5% in the ﬁrst quarter reﬂecting the signiﬁcant market term in the wake
of the war in Ukraine and general macroeconomic uncertainty. The match portfolio return
0.1% negative and the free portfolio return minus 1%. The results for the quarter was
negatively impacted by higher interest rates, the decline in equity markets and higher
credit spreads. Private equity and commodities contributed positively to the performance.
We have reduced risk on our portfolio in response to the market conditions. We are
prepared for further market turbulence for quite some time. Although, we cannot avoid
the impact, we have a balanced portfolio and solid ﬁxed income investments with the
large majority having investment grade rating. Our investment strategy remains ﬁrm with
risk exposure within the range is set by our Board. The proceeds from Oslo Areal
transaction have been invested in ﬁxed income instruments. We will continue to consider
attractive investment opportunities within our risk appetite, including real estate.
Over to Page 14. Our capital position is very strong with a solvency ratio of 188% at the
end of the quarter. The ratio is down 2 percentage points from year end. Remember that
we have at the year end, estimated a solvency margin of approximately 180% adjusted
and announced, but not ﬁnalized sale of Oslo Areal and the acquisition of Falck. Eligible
own funds came down by NOK2.3 billion driven by a positive contributions from solvency
operating earnings oﬀset primarily by the loss of the free portfolio and acquisition of

FINAL

formulaic as well as the formulaic dividend. Our capital requirement decreased primarily
due to lower market risk following the sale of Oslo Areal and lower exposure to equities
and high yield bonds.
A few words about IFRS 17 on Page 15. We are well prepared for the new accounting
standard, which will become eﬀective from next year. Overall, we expect a limited impact
for our general insurance accounts. We will be using the simpliﬁed method. And our
preliminary calculations indicate an insigniﬁcant eﬀect on our underwriting results. We
expect a signiﬁcant impact on our pension business opening balance. We're working
through the numbers and we'll discuss this in further detail together with further insights
into the impacts on our general insurance business in the webinar in November this year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Finally, a few words on the latest development of our operational targets on Slide 16. We
launched a set of new operational targets at our Capital Markets Day in November last
year. These are important in supporting delivery on our strategic priorities, and ﬁnancial
targets towards 2035. Customer satisfaction continues to be at a very high level, retention
in Norway is slightly up for the fourth quarter from an already very high level. And
retention in outside Norway has improved in Sweden and the Baltics and remained
broadly unchanged in Denmark.
Digitalization automation are our key measures to secure eﬃciency. Digitalization index,
we have established (inaudible) progress in our digital sales and service interaction with
our customers is a combined index which we enter a race by 10% annually or next years.
They are up 7% this quarter a progress I'm very satisﬁed with. On the claims funding side,
digital claims reporting has been stable this quarter at 76% for the group. Automation of
the whole claims settlement process is an area with signiﬁcant savings potential. We
introduced a new KPI on automated claims and the share of the claims processed
automatically in Norway has improved with a 1 percentage point during the quarter
currently standing at 56%. We'll continue to develop these digital services further going
forward.
I then hand over back to Helge.

Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Thank you, Jostein. To sum up on Page 17, we are very pleased with the solid results we
continue to deliver. We have set ambitious targets for the next four years, and we are
conﬁdent to deliver on that. We will continue to focus on proﬁtable growth together with
strong and eﬃcient operations of our strong product oﬀering and good economic
prospects in our markets, this should bode well for continued solid results and attractive
returns.
And ﬁnally on Page 18, an announcement on an upcoming webinar on the 9th of June,
where we will be discussing our plans within the mobility space with Falck road assistance
and the toll road companies Ferde and Vegamot in the group. We will send out and
release with further details shortly. But in the meantime, please save this date.

Questions And Answers

FINAL

Operator
(Question And Answer)
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We will take our ﬁrst question from Blair Stewart from
Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thank you very much, and good morning, gents. I've got three questions, they're
somewhat detail orientated, so nothing major. The ﬁrst one is just on Sweden with a new
system that you're implementing. Can you talk a little bit about what impact that will have,
you did so and in a bit cautious about the short-term, talking about perhaps an impact on
customer volumes? Just wonder what that meant? And I think longer-term, what the
beneﬁts will bring? And you talked about being transformational, a game changer?

Bloomberg Transcript

And then secondly, just on the private equity performance in the quarter. Am I right in
thinking that still done on a one quarter lag. So would it be reasonable to expect a much
weaker performance in Q2 as you report it?
And thirdly on IFRS 17, I think you've talked about -- you talked about signiﬁcant impact.
Does that mean lower opening balance for the PC business and the pensions business. I
think you talked in the past about having on the one hand, the beneﬁt from discounting
the reserves but then that's oﬀset by a higher risk premium. I just wonder how your
thoughts have evolved there given the interest rates have moved up a little, thought the
discounting impact would have been a bit more, a bit larger. So therefore the net eﬀect
may be a bit smaller. So just any additional thoughts on the IFRS 17 impact? I appreciate
it's still early days. Thanks very much.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Good morning, Blair. Its Helge. The core system, as you know, the background for this
present core system in Norway and also it's a sister system, we have had in Sweden and
Denmark, it's like 27 years old or something like. So all the players in the Nordics have to
move into more modern systems. And what we will see in Denmark ﬁrst and they are
planning currently planning for Sweden. This will enhance our competitive advantage
enable to sorter time to market, competitive pricing, and operational eﬃciency. We
expect to see the impact over time. In the short-term though, we receive beneﬁts from
facing out all systems and we will make room for investments in the new system. So it's
about agility, speed, our ability to take into the whole payment process and the whole
core system process partners. So it's lots of ﬂexibility speed and, of course, also cost per
quality.

Page 8 of 21

I can say that in private Denmark, it's very successful and really strong feedback from the
front people dealing with the system now and for all practical reasons, we have the whole
private business into the system in Denmark. So it's really successful. Sweden, we are
planning and I guess '23, '24 is the years for Sweden.

FINAL

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

And sorry, I have to -- why do you say that short-term, the sales could be impacted
negatively in Sweden?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

No, I'm not saying we will beneﬁt from facing out the old system and the system in
Denmark and No -- and Sweden, if you compare that to Norway, the cost per policy has
been rather high. So we will see reduction in cost per policy short and long-term. And
long-term we will see that, I would say, that more strategic eﬀects by -- these have the
much more agile system as I said, shorter time to market, ability to change prices
continuously, take on board partners et cetera. That's a more long-term -- we will see
long-term eﬀects. Short-term, we will see reduction in cost per policy.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay. Understood. So much messages. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

On the private equity question, you're absolutely right. It's in general a lag from one
quarter, we need to get the reported net asset values from the underlying funds that we -the investment in the portfolio. When that will imply a negative drop in Q2, is a bit earlier
to tell so far and we will not guide on that, because I mean these are not the overall
market. This is signiﬁcant -- speciﬁc investments in each and every fund that will
determine how this development goes. Some of the exposure here is, of course, oil
services related, which some had quite a run during the ﬁrst quarter in the listed market.
So this is a bit early to say.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay. Understood.

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Thirdly, IFRS 17, yes, I mean, you're right. At the year end, we say that there would be a
negative eﬀect on overall, the (inaudible) few major eﬀects on the insurance side, it's a
discounting aﬀect the reserves. There's a new risk margin, and then there's mark-tomarket on the health and authority bonds, which are have a positive over value in the
accounts today.
Net-net we said, it was a negative eﬀect at the end of 2021 with interest rates moving up.
This might have changed some of now, we haven't done the calculation as of the ﬁrst
quarter yet, but we'll update you when we get to the webinar.

If I may add just a comment on the core system, I'm kindly remind by Mitra here that
short-term, we will may be see some sales reduction, because when you implement a
system like this, you will have focus on implementation instead of the ordinary course of
business selling products. We have seen that as a minor problem in Denmark. And as you
know, I'm very focused on the cost side, and I'm also very pleased that we started to
report on the 13 ﬁgures on cost ratio and also. So I was on the cost side, when I
commented the new core system maybe some sales destruction in the implementation
phase.

We will take our next question from Tryfonas Spyrou from Berenberg. Your line is open.
Please go ahead.

Q - Tryfonas Spyrou

{BIO 21705826 <GO>}

Oh, hi. Good morning. I have one question. I was wondering, can perhaps comment on
where do you see claims inﬂation across the diﬀerent parts of your book, for example,
motor housing and obviously in diﬀerent sort of geography, so, Norway versus Denmark.
And I guess following up on from that, how do you see competition in these markets? Do
you still see competition being rational, when it comes to price increases? Or do you see
players taking diﬀerent approaches? Thank you.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Yes. We got the claims inﬂation. I would start to stress and comment once again, that this
is simply a ordinary course of business for us. In ﬁrst quarter, we have not seen any
inﬂation other than what we communicated one quarter ago. So claims inﬂation so far has

Page 10 of 21

FINAL

been in line with our previous expectations. If you look forward and we always have to
look forward when we are talking about claims inﬂation.
Its property in Norway with highest claims inﬂation driven by both materials and wages.
We expect that to be in the range between 7% and 9%, if you are looking 12 months
ahead. And for motor, it's between 4% and 6% and that's driven by wages, materials,
hypo [ph] claims and frequency and we will see higher percentage in the end of the year,
between 4% and 6%.
And as you know, all of our over personal risk are related to wage increases and so called
G factor in Norway and that's between 4% and 5%. The G factor in 2021 was just below
5%. In Denmark, it's lower and in Sweden, it's lower but we have seen an inﬂation in -picked up both in Denmark and Sweden too. But as I said, these levels are somewhat
lower than in Norway.

Q - Tryfonas Spyrou

{BIO 21705826 <GO>}

And I guess on -- just a comment on that, are you sort of (Multiple Speakers) based on
that sort of 12-month view of 7% to 9% in the quarterly percent, does that in line with the
sort of -- yes.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

We have demonstrated since 2018 that we have enormous pricing power. As you
remember, we had this back on track related to motor insurance, we then operated with
price increases for above 10%. What we are talking about now, it's that we have to and will
and have ability to price in line with expected claims inﬂation. And what we see from our
competitors is that they experience just the same as we do. And we both hear from calls
and we see from market operations that this is well understood and all of our competitors
see the same landscape I think. So -- but we have ability to price in line with claims
inﬂation, we will do that. And we just comment the balance between volume and price in
motor in the ﬁrst quarter when we priced in line with claims inﬂation is a nice balance
between volume and price increased growth. So we are really conﬁdent that we will
handle this in a good manner.

We do not see any special softening market trends within and its segment. It's highly
competitive market, as you know and it has been for many years, but I think the market
see this inﬂationary development and they have to increase prices to maintain their
proﬁtability as we do.

Q - Ulrik Ardal Zurcher

{BIO 19208986 <GO>}

Thank you. Two questions. Firstly, I was just wondering if given the material inﬂation and
supply chain issues that they accelerated in March now and that many corporates are repriced in January. You see any short-term risk to your claims ratio there?
Second question, I agree that motor looks strong, but I was wondering, how you see the
competition in private property in Norway and that's -- if it's a risk that even given your
repricing that we might not see nominal premium growth for that product this year?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I'll start on them. I mean, it's true that we upped our future actually, say inﬂation
expectations on private -- on both property assets somewhat from the previous quarter
approximately a percentage points in each end of the intro. We said at that time that we
will increase pricing ahead of claims inﬂation, but the aim to do that and we are doing
that, which means that we are pricing -- our pricing -- price increases contain, no new
higher claims inﬂation estimate. Any unexpected increase in the inﬂation is short-term
negative and we need to capture that on next repricing opportunity.
Yes. On property -- private property, I mean we do guide for kind of premium volumes in
most speciﬁc business line going forward. But given the fairly high, I mean we price in line
with this new expected, higher claims inﬂation and that there should be a reduction in
volume to more than contract. And this is -- it's highly unlikely, I will not go any further
than that in guiding, but it's -- you should expect premium growth, normal premium
growth going forward as well.

Q - Ulrik Ardal Zurcher

{BIO 19208986 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

I think also -- I also think that our ﬁrst quarter currency adjusted 9.9% growth is a strong
evidence that we have disability.

Q - Ulrik Ardal Zurcher

{BIO 19208986 <GO>}

Yes, but have any diﬀerent. Sorry, it was just a follow-up then on the property, because any
diﬀerence between private property and corporate property on how much is the churn
versus re-pricing?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Well, and if you look at the Norwegian portfolio, the churn is actually on the -- in the
segment as such we measured churn at the customer level. The journey is actually quite
Page 12 of 21

FINAL

similar between private and commercial, which is maybe surprisingly from a more
international perspective but the churn is typically is higher in the new commercial I think.
But given our main focus being on SME customers in the commercial part, which have a
very longstanding relationship with us.
We have the same kind of business relationship with them as business private persons in
around and they are loyal. Our pricing power and competitive position, our overall
oﬀering is very good to be a bit cautious in Norway. I wouldn't say superb but it's really
very good. And so this is not the concern in the self I would say. And I said, Helge said in
the previous question, this is kind of the overall input price increase for every company in
this market. We probably see it more than the others because we have the -- better than
the others because we have the other largest player but this is the same picture hitting
everyone.

Q - Hakon Astrup

{BIO 18861149 <GO>}

Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. Two questions from me. First, can you
give some color on how the current inﬂationary environment is impacting your reserves
(inaudible) look at how 1% high percentage points higher inﬂation over the next three
years will impact run-oﬀs and your reserves?
And the second question on the procurement, in this current environment, is it more
diﬃcult for you now to renew agreements with suppliers? And are there any interesting
changes in terms of terms et cetera?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Yes. I'll start on the ﬁrst one on the reserve impact from inﬂation. The major part of the
reserves are related to long tail lines of business and then it's the long-term assumptions
about especially wage and inﬂation, because it's a person -- personally a new injury
related products that are considered the largest part of the reserves. And our long-term
estimates for inﬂation on wage or time changed signiﬁcantly. And they are in line with
what we see that the central bank and the statistical Census Bureau are mitigating, which
is a return to more normal levels within two years. The short-term research related to
property, motor, health all are less exposed to inﬂationary. They are generally handled
within six months inﬂation doesn't quite that quickly. So it's -- there is some minor
negative eﬀect there, but that's the -- well handled within the current preserving.

Thanks. Just to say that, say wage inﬂation, for instance, they are just end up 1% above
your estimates over the next ﬁve years. How will that impact the total reserves? And can
you give us some number sensitivity here just as far as to do the calculations ourselves?

FINAL

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

I don't think, we'll go into that detail. It is numbers that we have done and used for
measuring around with position but not haven't made public earlier. But if you take ﬁve
years, and then a larger part of reserves is actually aﬀected. But as Helge mentioned, we
are at 4%, 5% on this derivative G amount, which is one that running or inﬂuencing that
the payout in the future. But the overall sale is I think is around eight years for the workers'
compensation products, for instance, which is I mean it's a long part -- large part of the
reserves, actually, even further out there. So I won't give you on the numbers sorry, but of
course there is a sensitivity.

Q - Hakon Astrup

{BIO 18861149 <GO>}

Thanks for the color.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Yes. We are -- we have a large claims organization with good agreements and we have
continuous dialogue with our suppliers on changes in prices, but 90% of repairs in
Norway and Denmark and managed through contracted suppliers and we had best
market terms in Norway. And 75% of the costs are related to labor with ﬁxed rates and
annual indexation. So, of course, the discussions and negotiations with the suppliers when
you come to the year-end, I guess they use more time now compared to one year ago
and two years ago. But I do not have any reports to me that we have problems in that type
of dialogue. So it's a ordinary business as well.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Thank you for taking my questions as well. I have two. Firstly, inﬂation question a little bit
diﬀerent. This is so that you think there is unlimited price increases, you can get onto your
clients and that they will actually accept it, since they have no place to hide, but what do
you think about the volumes. Do you think they will negotiate on their tariﬀs? And do
some other changes to this, so they can sort of -- so you will get the lower price or volume
for going forward. Is that something -- is something you can think of here is, that's
unthinkable so to speak.

FINAL

It's seldom, and I say that the question are wrong, actually, but we are not talking about
unlimited ability Jan Erik. And I think it's important to start with the fact that the main
driver for claims inﬂation is wage increases. And the G amount now is just around below
5%, but if you look at the estimates from Sweden, Denmark, and Norway for government
is below 4% going forward. So we are not talking about limited with our perspective as we
speak now.
But you know, this is non-life insurance, it's the best for the next 12 months. The business
is that we have to have estimate for claims inﬂation. That's also the same type of estimates
and bets that our main competitors have to do. And in the environment we have no, we
are very conﬁdent that we have strong ability to pass through the claims inﬂation in price
increases, but we are not talked about -- we haven't talked about unlimited. So that's a
scenario we do not look into at the moment.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. And you now have a new product in the housing or the re-selling stuﬀ
you talked about. How should you think about that this is a premium that people pay
before they sell their house to -- so you can -- they can do some more preparation on
before they selling or how is the pricing premiums and claims on that kind of product
with?

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

It's a service, and it's not the risk premium. So this is a service concept if you are talking
about this, yes.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Maksimer. I think --

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Maksimer.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Yes. And I think, what we are [ph] into pilots, Jan Erik, is that the average cost for
preparations before selling is between NOK25,000 and NOK30,000. So this is the service
beside the insurance premiums that we oﬀer to our suppliers together with our suppliers
for our customers to prepare for selling. And doing this, we take more care of our
customers. We solve bigger problems and we position of home seller insurance in a good
way.

Our next question comes from Thomas Svendsen from SEB. Your line is open, please go
ahead.

Q - Thomas Svendsen

{BIO 6070863 <GO>}

Yes, good morning. A question to the large claims, if you look at the large claims, I look
away from whether eﬀects. Is it possible to say anything about how much it's sort of as
cyclical component, that these larger claims are increasing and the column is doing well.
And how much is sort of unlock? And if you should be prepared for maybe more large
claims in the next couple of years than what has seen in the last couple of years?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

We do not expect that, Thomas. I'm going to see that there is any kind of cyclicity in the -word absurd. I mean, in general, we do not make public, so the actual losses or the simple
each and every loss, but if we did send out the press release related to the (inaudible)
which is a building under construction that too far. We don't see anything speciﬁc about
the (inaudible) that we've had in a non-vendor related, lots of stuﬀ we've had in the ﬁrst
quarter. I would subtract these two pure randomness.

Q - Thomas Svendsen

{BIO 6070863 <GO>}

I don't know the question to private Norway. Given that the households or your customers
disposal income is reduced by electricity price, in general, increases interest rate,
increases on mobile so sharp insurance premiums increases. Should we still expect that
sort of the underlying volumes if not sensitive to sort of households income or should
expect that the amount -- sort of the total amount of insurance to go down that the
households are doing something, because their disposable income is sharply the great
thing?

A - Jostein Amdal

{BIO 19939645 <GO>}

Of the certain extent, at least in Scandinavia, these are basic products that you buy them
and it's the house on the car that you have, and more or less everyone actually ensures
that whether someone has a reaction to price increases, which is actually more coverage
on their car might be, but we've seen in the previous downturns that it doesn't typically
happen. Baltics was a bit diﬀerent story, we saw during the pandemic that people more --

they more tempted to cancel their policies short-term at least. But in Scandinavia, this is
not been a typical behavior. I mean, there are -- the number of new apartments, houses
still increasing, same goes for the car sales, so they were quite slow in the ﬁrst quarter of
2022. So, as the underlying assets increase in volume, the insurance volumes should also
increase.

Hi everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Mainly just ﬁrstly on the Baltics maybe,
thanks for laying out that plan. I just wondered sort of, on the conﬁdence level that you
have given, the combined ratio that you reported in 1Q is 113%. And also I noticed that
you're talking about seeking inorganic growth opportunities in the Baltics. So, just keen to
understand how that would ﬁt into the sort of restructuring there. And then also maybe
just on the home sellers market. I think you said about 10% market share, please could
you sort of remind us on what sort of market size you see there? And what sort of
contribution that is to sort of private lines?
And then maybe just on sort of new car and new and used car sales, that's been down in
the ﬁrst quarter. I was just wondering how that plays into to (inaudible). So do you expect
sort of lower new business growth, but also does that mean sort of higher attention as
more people probably stay with you. Just sort of want to understand that sort of dynamic?
Thanks.

A - Helge Leiro Baastad

{BIO 5865247 <GO>}

Yes. I commented the Baltics and we have used time together also with an external
partner and it's not dramatic measures actually, is quite well known measures, we are
implementing in the Baltic organization. It's about pricing, re-pricing, risk selection, it's
about cost production, signiﬁcantly cost reduction and it's also our focus to be more
focused going forward.
As I said, we will move towards and below 100% in combined ratio of this year. And
further we will move down towards 90% and demonstrate improvements quarter-byquarter. And as I have said before, we will continue to look for value creating solutions in
the Baltic, it's not so close to Norway and Sweden, and it's not Scandinavia but we will
also look for inorganic growth opportunities. So if it could increase our position and
secure our position in this proﬁtability journey, we have started now, we will also look into
that. So we are quite optimistic actually both buying and ﬁnding diﬀerent kind of solutions
in parallel with implementing the eﬃciency program we have started to implement now.

parallel, all kind of strategic opportunities will be evaluated.

The second question on the home seller insurance market, which was kind of open up
with this new product from January 1 this year. I think we commented on the expected
golden standard, which is kind of rough estimates, at over time this should develop
towards NOK2 billion to NOK3 billion. But I mean it has started very strongly, because the
new requirements for tax -- for assessments, processors is higher so that is actually the
turnover in the -- of new houses or sort of in the housing market has been over I think in
the ﬁrst quarter due to this.
And when we're saving 10% market is maybe kind of still got ﬁve large pockets of
distribution tool that we have secured for our product. I mean, the number i also NOK2
billion to NOK3 billion or a few years and then we'll see how this develops. This is, of
course, develops on the price level that we did in the over time period established itself in
that market.

Bloomberg Transcript

Third one, new car sales, yes, it over means new kind of new business from us from new
sales. But remember that our market share is higher in the second-hand transaction
market when the new submit cars into the second-hand here. And our -- the market share
there be it fossil or electric, whatever is much higher in that mode. So, as I commented on
the previous question here, the number of new cars is still actually increasing, mostly
number of cars just in Norway is increasing, which means our potential business volume is
also increasing.

I'll talk to the easy in a way, we -- although it might not be easy in fact. But we are able to
push through price increases that are at least in line with claims inﬂation. We've
demonstrated that over the increasing claims inﬂation period that we have behind us and
we will manage that also going forward. This is clearly doable. It is because we have a
very strong comparative position.

Talking about the competitors, we don't do. Remember that we have also a very strong
customer dividend model in our way and that's quite unique. And also we have to look

price increases, but we mainly focus on ourselves.

A - Jostein Amdal

Private Norway, I think we don't guide on kind of what will be the loss ratio or under IFRS 7
[ph] to be going forward. But if you kind of look at the underlying frequency loss ratio,
that is kind of nothing -- there is no kind of speciﬁc volatility or speciﬁc events that make it
so good. This is the -- just the accumulated eﬀects of work on everything with you on both
claims handling, eﬃcient pricing, and cost reductions. That is manifest itself in this level.
It's been very high proﬁtability elements for a number of quarters, so that I won't say
anything about kind of what will be the run rate over the next few quarter, I would say,
there's nothing speciﬁc about this quarter that is kind of should hindrance from

Well, I think, I might have mentioned it in our previous quarterly call, that there is a NOK1
billion run of gain that we have -- it's a last year of this year that they have this planned
reserve list from the vintages 2008 to 2014, mainly related to workers' comp in Norway,
personal accident cars, and on the workers' comp in Denmark.
We talked a bit about this on the CMD also in November, whereas if you look at
historically, there has been positive run of gains, I mean, one to two percentage points of
previous, but this is a -- this was history, our kind of guidance here is that we do not have
any planned reserve releases going forward.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland
