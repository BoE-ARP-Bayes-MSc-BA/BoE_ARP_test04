Presentation
Operator
Good morning. And welcome to Fairfax's 2011 Second Quarter results conference call.
Your lines have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the presentation, we will conduct
a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Today's conference is being
recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Your host for
today's conference call is Mr. Prem Watsa, with opening remarks from Brad Martin. Mr.
Martin, please begin, sir.

{BIO 3466650 <GO>}

Good morning. Welcome to the conference call to discuss Fairfax's Second Quarter 2011
results. The comments we make during this conference may contain forward-looking
statements. Actual results may differ perhaps materially from those contained in such
forward-looking statements, as a result, a large variety of uncertainties and risks and
uncertainties, most perceivable of which are listed in Fairfax's Annual Report, which is
available on our website at Fairfax.ca. Or set out in the Risk Factors in base shell
prospectus filed with Securities regulatory authorities in Canada, which is available on
SEDAR. I will now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Prem Watsa.

FINAL

John Varnell, our Chief Financial Officer, for additional financial details. In the first half of
2011, book value per share decreased by 2%. Adjusted for the $10 per share common
dividend paid in the First Quarter of 2011. The book value decreased to $359 per share. In
the Second Quarter, book value increased by $4.00 per share, or 1.1%. This is our Second
Quarter reporting under the International Financial Reporting Standards, IFRS. Our
investments are now shown at market value at the end of the quarter, and the fluctuation
in market values flows through the income statement.
Highlights during the quarter include, we had a net profit of $83.3 million in the Second
Quarter of 2011, approximately $3.40 per share. Mainly because of good operating
results, $119.6 million, approximately $120 million in net gains and investments, offset by a
$104 million loss on the premium paid for tendered bonds. The combined ratio of the
Company's insurance and reinsurance operations was 100.5% on a consolidated basis.
Underwriting results in the Second Quarter were negatively impacted by the $88.1 million
of pre-tax catastrophe losses, primarily related to US tornado losses, which increased the
combined ratio by 6.9percentage points.

Bloomberg Transcript

Net investment gains of $120 million in the Second Quarter of 2011 consisted of the
following. Please note the table on page two of our press release, which shows you the
breakdown of these gains. In the table, you can see net gains on bonds of $260 million,
predominately and were largely offset by net unrealized losses of $118 million on our CPI
consumer price index derivatives. Losses on equity and equity-related investments of $119
million, again largely unrealized, were offset by gains on our equity hedges. However, we
had large unrealized gains on cost of $389 million, which includes international coal.
Net premiums written by the Company's insurance and reinsurance operations in the
Second Quarter of 2011 increased by 24.4% to $1.3708 billion. Excluding acquisitions, our
consolidated premium grew by 10% in the Second Quarter, which included some foreign
exchange gains. Also during the quarter, we retired $694 million US of outstanding Fairfax,
Crum & Forster and Odyssey renotes, and refinanced this by issuing ten-year Fairfax
bonds in the United States and Canada at record low interest rates for us. The Company
held $1.14 billion of cash, short-term investments and marketable securities at the holding
company level, approximately $1.11 billion net of the short sale in derivative obligations.
This is all at June 30th 2011.
Finally, we continue to be approximately 86% hedged in relationship to our equity and
equity-related securities, which includes convertible bonds and convertible preferred
stocks. Now I would like to turn it over to John, so he can give you some more information
on the underlying financials. John?

John Varnell

{BIO 5699703 <GO>}

Thanks, Prem. First, I will talk about investment income, then operating company results,
and finally our financial position. On investment income, interest and dividend income in
the Second Quarter of 2011, increased by 4.6% to $195.1 million from the Second Quarter
of 2010 of $186.6 million. On a pre-tax equivalent basis, we own about $4.6 billion of tax
advantage municipal bonds, and therefore, the interest and dividend income related to
that should be grossed up for the tax advantage. The average portfolio size during the

FINAL

Second Quarter of 2011 for investments was almost $24.1 billion, compared to $22.4 billion
in the Second Quarter of 2010. Our annualized portfolio yield in the Second Quarter was
3.42%, compared to a yield of 3.5% in the Second Quarter of 2010.
Turning to operating company results, starting with Odyssey. In the Second Quarter of
2011, Odyssey had a combined ratio of 93.1, and an underwriting profit of $32.2 million. In
the Second Quarter of 2010, Odyssey had a combined ratio of 92.8, and an underwriting
profit of about $33.7 million. The Second Quarter 2011 combined ratio included about 10
combined ratio points, or $47 million, net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums
related to cat losses, compared to about $17 million, or about 3.6 combined ratio points
last year. In the Second Quarter of 2010, just for comparison, Odyssey also had $30
million, or 6.6 combined ratio points related to the deepwater Horizon loss.

Bloomberg Transcript

The Second Quarter 2011 underwriting result for Odyssey included 0.5 combined ratio
point, or about $1.8 million, attributable to net favorable development of prior year's
reserves. In terms of premium volumes, Odyssey had a 9.1% increase, or $38 million in net
premiums written, to $460 million in the Second Quarter from $421 million last year.
Primarily as a result of increased property business, some foreign exchange movements,
offset by reduced casualty business.
Crum & Forster reported an underwriting loss of $8.4 million, and a combined ratio of
103.4 in the Second Quarter of 2011. Compared to an underwriting loss of $10.7 million,
and a combined ratio of 106 in the Second Quarter of 2010. Crum & Forster results
included 0.7 of a combined ratio point, or $1.8 million of unfavorable development of prior
year's reserves. 2010 had $5.3 million, or 2.9 points of favorable development. Crum &
Forster's net premiums written increased by 40% in the quarter, compared to the Second
Quarter 2010. Principally due to the acquisition of First Mercury. If we excluded First
Mercury, the premiums at Crum & Forster increased 6.4%, as a result of growth in their
specialty business.
Zenith National reported an underwriting loss of $35 million, and a combined ratio of 129
for the Second Quarter of 2011. There was development of prior year reserves of $6.6
million, or 5.5 combined ratio points. Net premiums earned during the Second Quarter
and first six months of 2011 increased year-over-year by 14% for both periods respectively,
reflecting the combined impacts of new business and higher retention of their renewal
business.
Northbridge reported a combined ratio of 104.3 and an underwriting loss of $11.6 million in
the Second Quarter. That compared to a 106.6 combined ratio, and a $16.4 million
underwriting loss in the year-ago quarter. Second quarter of 2011 underwriting results for
Northbridge included 6.7 combined ratio points, or $18 million of net favorable
development. There was 3.7 combined ratio points, or almost $9 million of favorable
prior-period reserve development in the Second Quarter of 2010. Net premiums written
at Northbridge were $337 million in the quarter, an increase of 8% from $312 million in US
dollar terms last year, largely reflecting the stronger Canadian dollar.

FINAL

Fairfax Asia had another successful quarter. Their combined ratio was 85. This quarter
compared to a combined ratio of 94.5 last year. Their net premiums written were $52
million, up 40% from $37 million last year. However, the Second Quarter 2011 does include
$10.3 million of Pacific Insurance premium, which was the acquisition we closed in the first
part of the year.
In our segment that we call reinsurance and insurance other, the net premiums increased
to $146 million for the Second Quarter, compared to $113 million last year. The Second
Quarter combined ratio was 92.7, compared to 91.8 last year for that segment. And the
individual results in the Second Quarter were combined ratios for group RE of 99, Advent
of 73, and Polish RE of 110. Turning to our financial position, as Prem said, we ended the
quarter $358.60 a share. That is an IFRS book value that would be comparable out IFRS
book value at December 31st of $376.33 per share. Common shareholders equity
increased slightly from $7.24 billion at March 31st 2011, to $7.31 billion at June 30th 2011.

Bloomberg Transcript

As Prem said, we issued ten-year senior notes for US $500 million at 5.8%, and Canadian
$400 million at 6.4% in the quarter. And when we retired the debt, we recorded a onetime charge of $104 million in connection with the repurchase of the Fairfax, Crum &
Forster and Odyssey notes. Our debt at the holding company increased slightly, and the
debt at the subsidiary decreased during the Second Quarter. At the holding company it
increased at the subs, it decreased overall on a total consolidated basis, it increased
somewhat. Due to the senior note repurchase, we finished the Second Quarter with a
slightly higher total debt to total cap ratio of 27.1%, which is compared to 25.5% at March
31st. That is it, Prem.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) One moment please. Our first question comes from Jeff Fenwick
from Cormark Securities.

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Hi, Jeff.

Q - Jeff Fenwick

{BIO 15350794 <GO>}

Good morning, gentlemen. So Prem, in the quarter we saw the news that Andy Bernard is
moving into a role to oversee the global insurance operations, and that was followed by
some restructuring at Northbridge. Maybe you can speak about what the vision is for

Page 4 of 13



Company N ame: Fairfax Financial H oldings L td
Company Ticker: FFH CN Equity
Date: 2011-07-29

Andy. Is this the first step in several sort of enhancements to the business that we can
expect going forward?

FINAL

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Yes, Jeff. So this is something that we have announced in the Annual Report and talked at
our Annual Meeting, as you know. It is a very significant development for us. We have very
decentralized operations. With Andy Bernard being put in charge of our
insurance/reinsurance operations, what we expect to do is to get a lot more coordination
between our companies, in the US particularly. But also elsewhere. And in terms of
opportunity, and of course, if there is competition among our companies, then that is the
kind of areas where Andy will come in to reduce that. So it is a very positive move. Andy
has been with us for the better part of 15 years, maybe 16 years now. And has built
Odyssey as you know from $150 million to $2.5 billion worldwide reinsurance company. So
we are very excited about that. So we continue to be decentralized. But Andy will
coordinate our insurance/reinsurance operations. The Canadian operations restructuring,
the fact that we are forming Northbridge Insurance Company. No. That was planned
sometime back, Jeff. No connection between the two.

Q - Jeff Fenwick

{BIO 15350794 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. And perhaps if I just follow-up with one more question. So after a period here of
seeing premiums held back and shrinking through soft market, we have seen a couple
quarters now with some nice organic growth out of your operations. Are we starting to
see some hardening in some various corners of where Fairfax is active, and what is your
feel there? That seems to be a fairly significant change here in the approach to
underwriting?

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Yes. So Jeff, you are exactly right, in a soft cycle we shrink. We've seen the markets
stabilize. We are seeing property cat prices strong. Workers' compensation is stabilizing
and perhaps increasing a little . The speciality lines are also firming up, so you are seeing
Crum & Forster, excluding the acquisition of First Mercury up about 9.5% in that area,
Odyssey RE is up. So we are seeing the markets react some. But it is still early days. The
redundancies of the past are disappearing as you know. So that has helped the industry.
That is slowly changing. And might well be pretty well gone this year, and perhaps next.
And the investment income continues to come down, as you have the bonds rolling over
from higher rates to lower rates. So we think the markets will change. And perhaps
significantly. We can't say when. But our companies are well positioned to, as we have
done in the past, to increase premiums very significantly, not on our forecast, but on the
prices actually going up significantly. We are focused on underwriting profit, and when we
get the opportunity we will react.

Q - Jeff Fenwick

{BIO 15350794 <GO>}

Okay. Great. Thank you.

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Thank you. Paul Holden from CIBC.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

FINAL

Thank you. Good morning.

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

First question is related to cat losses from Japan. When you booked them in Q1, you said
there might be some deviation or volatility, in terms of that estimate because it was hard
to determine at that time. Do you have any more comfort now with your original estimate
for cat losses?

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Our Japanese, you could still say it's early days, because it's Second Quarter. But it
has stabilized. So we haven't seen any movement of any significance. The cat pricing,
though, has gone up on renewals quite significantly. Right up to 50% for Japanese
renewals, particularly with some cat exposure. And so we are seeing that. But our
estimates for the Japanese I believe are holding.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Okay. One more question, if I may, just regarding your position in US Treasuries and
Munis, given what is taking place in the US and potential for a sovereign rating
downgrade. Any sort of change of opinion or stance or comments that you can make with
respect to your holding in US Treasuries?

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Well we are long-term and we think that debt limits will be worked out ultimately. And
even in the worst case, where the United States takes a downgrade, if you compare the
world, I think investors worldwide will still consider US Treasuries to be the best
government bonds that you can buy. The best country to invest in, in spite of all of the
problems that exist in the world. So we think this is a short-term issue. It will be solved. It
will be resolved one way or the other. And we, of course, focus on the long-term.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Thank you.

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Julianne, next question.

Thank you. Tom MacKinnon from BMO Capital.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes. Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone.

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Good morning, Tom.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Question with respect to I guess the underwriting environment. It looks like we are seeing
some improving results really at Odyssey RE to some extent, and then across the board
with a lot of other reinsurers. And I am wondering if you can comment on why that hasn't
really necessarily transpired into improvements in Northbridge and Crum & Forster, even if
we look at combined ratios kind of ex-cats and ex-reserve development. We really
haven't seen over the last couple of years really any improvement in Northbridge and
Crum & Forster, but we have seen some improvement with Odyssey RE. Maybe dig down
into how much of the property cat price was related?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

In terms of pricing, the US tends to go down much faster and then also come back much
faster. Canada tends to lag. On top of that, I think we had quite, with the (Sladlick) files
and we had some cat losses too in Canada. John, you want to add to that?

A - John Varnell

{BIO 5699703 <GO>}

Sure. Well Northbridge and Crum both have more commercial business as well. So the
commercial business has been quite competitive in both Canada and the United States.
So that is where there is more pricing pressure. Odyssey has more of a mixture, where
they can move around. So they can do more property cat. They can decrease their
casualty lines. So they have more flexibility in what they can do, whereas Northbridge and
Crum have to work at that commercial business. They will move and more to specialty
lines, but they still have the commercial business that they have to compete in.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Okay. That helps explain it. What percentage, John, of what is being written at Odyssey
would be property cat?

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Some property cat exposure would be, if you had to take our business that has some
exposure, it would be about 20% or 25%. Some type of cat exposure. And so we are
writing more of, that well within our limits. Well within our limits, of course, Tom. But we
see opportunity in the property cat area. And so we are taking Odyssey RE under Brian
Young and Andy Bernard of course are taking advantage of that.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

So going forward, I guess the $1 million question is when is this going to trickle down into
some sort of firmness in commercial lines? And I guess the question is there is nothing
that you can see that is going to indicate that? I mean, you are still in the release--?

FINAL

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

It is like everything else associated with markets. You have to be ready. You have to be
patient. You can't write when the markets are not appropriate and sub-markets. Then you
have got to wait. And we are patient. We have been in business for 25 years. We have
seen the cycles. So you just wait. And when the opportunity comes, we will react. But we
won't until the opportunity is in front of us. And it is the same in the financial markets, Tom.
You are right. You remember in 2006 and 2007, we were very patient. We had
government bonds. We had our stock positions hedged, in 2008 completely hedged. But
when the markets went down 50%, we took the hedges off. We bought a lot of common
stock, and when the spreads widened dramatically at the end of 2008 and early 2009,
we reacted. But you had to be patient. You had to have government bonds. You had to
have hedged your stock positions to take advantage of that opportunity. In the insurance
business, it is very similar. So all of our presidents are being very careful and focused on
underwriting, and waiting for that right time when the markets have changed, and the
opportunity is in front of us.

Quick questions related to, thank you. Good morning. A couple questions on the

position. Was that the main driver of the capital gains in the quarter?

No. We had quite a few situations that gave us the gains mark. But the one that we have
talked about in the past, which has been in the press, is international coal. That was
significant. But we had other realized and unrealized. We had quite a few unrealized
positions that went up. But the one that we have, we are able to talk about is international
coal. Once at the end of the year, of course, we tell you where the big gains were on
cost, unrealized. But our common stock position, if you look at the press release that we
have for you on page two, you can see in the Second Quarter, equity and equity-related
investments, we lost $119 million.
And on the hedges, we made $119 million. So it was flat. And if you go into the six months,
Mark, you will see remaining $500 million and equity hedges were $309 million. So we
made after the hedges about $200 million, $194 million to be exact. But there are
fluctuations with IFRS, all of the fluctuations go through our balance sheet and our income
statement. But we like our position, we like the fact that we are hedged 86%. We like the
fact that we have got government bonds, a significant amount of them. The spreads have
narrowed significantly. The stock prices are up 100% from the bottom. We think that you
have to be cautious, you have to be careful, and so that is where we are. We are very
cautious in capital today. That doesn't mean we don't take advantage of opportunities
that we see. But we are cautious in this environment.

Okay. One other real quick question. The recently reported position in Bank of Ireland, is
that going to be a holding company investment? Or is that going to be purchased by
using the cash at the subsidiary levels?

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

No. This is just a regular insurance investment, Mark. Because it was in the Bank of Ireland,
and in Ireland it was significant. Got a lot of publicity. So we explained why we acquired
that position. We did that, I guess there were three others that acquired it together with
us, separately I may add. But did their own work. But we like Ireland, we have been there
for 20 years. And so like Ireland. We like the Bank of Ireland as the best bank in Ireland,
the only private one. And a full-service bank with 250 branches. And as a financial services
analyst, Mark, you will recognize that their capital position is very strong. Tier one capital is
at 15%. Core equity capital, meaning equity capital is 10%. They have, the Central Bank of
Ireland has very significant, very tough stress tests. And they hired Blackrock to put these
stress tests in. And the two tests that they have, one, house prices dropped 60% from
the top. And commercial property prices dropped 70% from the top. And you still have to
have your minimum capital levels. So the 15 tier one and 10 from core can handle these to
two stress events. And so we liked it. We like the management team. We like Richie
Boucher, who is CEO, he is very disciplined, focused, very commercial. So we liked him.
And we made our investment, we own less than 10%. But it will be an investment for us,
part of our $24 billion portfolio.

Yes. The next question comes from (Sergie Catrin, KIP).

Q - Sergie Catrin
Good morning. Hello. Could you please comment on your insurance runoff business? And
the second question is, could you please comment on your CPI deliveries please?

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Okay. So the runoff business, it is a business that we have. And have had for a long time,
1998. So for 12 years. We like the business. We have a very good team run by Nick Bentley.
And we have made a couple of acquisitions which we described in our Annual Report. We
like the business. We like the management that we have. And over time it has been a very
good business. You can see the results in our Second Quarter statements. Under CPI, the
consumer price index, so we had a cost of $428 million that we invested in the consumer
price index derivatives, that benefit from deflation, but that suffer from inflation, again
explained in our Annual Report. Versus cost, versus what we paid for it. We have already
taken a $246 million loss, unrealized. These are ten-year contracts, so in our books it is at
$182 million.
When you look at the six months, you will see a $285 million loss in the six months, that is
because we had some unrealized profits in 2010. But if you look at costs, we paid $428
million, we have taken a $246 million loss. So it is in our books at $182 million. This is what

fluctuations do, they go up and down. These are ten-year contracts. We think of this as
insurance in terms of the unexpected. And if we have deflation, these contracts can be
very, very valuable, and we have not sold any. We have the better part of $50 billion in
terms of nominal exposure. But the fluctuations, so our statements in the first six months,
$285 million loss, that has gone through our statements. But in terms of our costs, it is
original cost, $246 million. We like it and we like it over the long-term.

Could you just remind me what your cost is in some of your international operations? And
how you think about the value of those? You seem to be every quarter you make more
investments.

A - John Varnell

{BIO 5699703 <GO>}

Okay. Cost in the international operations. Wait until I get my sheet here.

A - Prem Watsa

Yes. We have a little in the Annual Report for you. But John, approximately how much have
you got in international operations? Our share?

A - John Varnell

{BIO 5699703 <GO>}
