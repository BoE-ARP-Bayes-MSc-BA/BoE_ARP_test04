Well. Good morning to all of you. Welcome to Hannover Re's Investors' Day 2017. I'm really
delighted that so many of you were able to take up our invitation. This is the 20th
Investors' Day that we held today. And although, it doesn't feel like a birthday party. But
it's a great pleasure to have you all here and to mark with us this occasion. So a very warm
welcome here in Frankfurt. I was also pleased that so many of you managed to attend
yesterday evening's dinner at the Deutsche Film Museum. We had certainly hoped, that
you might find the venue interesting. After all, there are some elements that you show in
your own studies and have something in common with a good movie or a novel. Such as a
compelling story, edge of the seats tension, colorful characters, striking originality. And
last but not least a catchy title.

As if we could possibly forget just how creative you are, we need to only remind ourself
of the titles of recently published notes on the industry or on Hannover Re, in particular.
Just a few examples: Gone with the wind, was one of them or blame him, pricing the term
or in the eye of the storm. And I don't mind admitting a special favorite of mine, which
was, this time it's different. I only missed the word somewhat. I can only congratulate to
you on the creativity you displayed in pursuit of your goal, namely, getting investors
excited about the reinsurance business. That said, yesterday evening was truly
unforgettable, a great atmosphere and a marvelous location. I certainly, won't forget
some of the pictures we have taken nor will I be posting them on the social network. A
very big thank you, to Katherine and Julia for their choice of the venue. You both devoted
so much energy and care in putting everyone together. Even though, once again, we find
ourselves in the presence of a stage, cameras and (lightening). And I'm very much aware
that the contrast compared to yesterday could hardly be greater. Our program today is
free of fictional elements. The content we are in no way fixtures nor are the cost actors.
Quite the contrary, everything that we have to tell you today, asked to be taken seriously.
And it will be presented live and in color by Hannover Re's A-list celebrities. Best of all,
there won't be any commercial breaks, by the way.

Bloomberg Transcript

The storybook, we have to assemble is, at least in our eyes, breathtakingly fascinating. In
no small measure, it reflects the inspiration we have gained from your comments and
feedbacks on previous occasions and in past conversations. And when the clapper board
claps for the final time, this afternoon, we will look forward for your feedback and
comments on today's program.
You will find the feedback form on your desk. I cannot emphasize enough, how highly
value the -- your feedback and remarks are. Before I say action, I would like to make a few
organizational remarks. The cameras are going to webcast all the presentations and the
Q&A sessions, of course. Some colleagues have already locked in to follow the day's
events online. The stream will be available on our Hannover Re website so that you can
replay the best scenes, at a later date as often as you wish. But this in mind, during the
Q&A, please wait for the microphones. So everybody gets to hear your question in the
best high-fidelity sound quality. The access key for a free Wi-Fi is on our desk, as always,
together with a modest gift. The boost from this power bar will hopefully leave you or at
least your electronic devices feeling energized and reloaded. It also has a rather nice
Bluetooth surprise built-in. But I'm sure you will find out. Please consider this as a token of
our appreciation for the participation today and the support that you have shown to
Hannover Re and the Investor Relations team in -- for many years.
On that note, I would like to welcome our CEO Ulrich Wallin to the stage. Ulrich, the floor
is yours.

Thank you, Karl. And thanks for reminding me that I should be serious, let me try it.
Yes. Well you see our new title. Or I should say good morning, first, I guess, because I was
asked to be serious. And I will be. Yes. Good morning to all, warm welcome from me as
well. And I appreciate you all coming. And I share Karl's views on the venue yesterday

evening, even though, I missed taking a picture of myself, let it be taken on the red
carpet. But that's not so important, I guess. So we will start our strategy revision for the
years 2018 to 2020. Because as you know, we have a strategic cycle, where every three
years, we look at our strategy. And that of course, starts with a look at the market
conditions as a whole. So what is the -- I mean pond we're swimming in? What's our
universe of business we are transacting? And that is of course, the reinsurance business.
And therefore, its, of course, for us it's important to understand, how the reinsurance
business is developing? Who are the players? How are the markets look like? What you
can see here is the P&C reinsurance market and its developments since 2012. And you
can see that the market has grown not dramatically. But a little bit. You can also see that
there is a kind of, I mean, fly to the larger reinsurers. So the top 10 reinsurers have
increased their market share over time to the detriment particular of the -- all the smaller
reinsurance companies. So their market share, actually, by premium has actually been
reduced over time. But you can also see that the P&C market is still very fragmented. So
you have very many players, hundreds of players in that market and that of course,
includes all the facilities, is that under right on -- based on a collateralized basis so the ILS
market. They are largely in the all as a category.
If it comes to Hannover Re, you can see that we managed over time to increase our
market share. So in rough terms, we increased from 4% to 5%. And of course, we
achieved that by growing faster than the market. And that is, for us, important because
we feel that our position is one of the lead market. Over time, we should be able to
increase our market share. This 5-year periods that are displayed here, of course, are -- is
a 5-year period of a softening market. I mean. So the -- of those five years, the highest
rating quality we had in 2012. And the lowest rating quality we had in 2016. But you can
see that partly the growth of course, will also be driven by, I mean, more advantageous
prices to the ceding companies. I mean, the fragmentation of the market also tells you,
that the entrants hurdle into the P&C reinsurance market is not particularly high. I always
say, you just need an office in Bermuda, you take a few gray-haired guys and take $1
billion. And you are up and running to write P&C business through the brokers. At the
same time, the set business model, it's not that easy to enter the top 10. It takes time.
And therefore, there is a little bit more stability in this market, than you will assume from
the low entrance hurdle. But at the same time, I mean, it is a structurally competitive
market.
If you then come to the Life & Health business, the other field, where we are active. You
can see that it has grown a little bit more pronounced, as that partly also has to do with
the currency conversion. Because this is all measured in euros. And I think you probably
remember that the euro gained in value quite a bit in 2015. And this is of course, part of
the growth. But needless to say, the Life & Health market is growing at a slightly larger
pace than the P&C market. You can also see that the market is a lot more concentrated
than the P&C market. We see top 10 players having almost all of the business, apart from
some local players, it was 94%. And the reason for that is that, contrary to the P&C
business, which is driven by the new and renewal business, particularly, the life part of the
Life & Health business is driven by the in force, due to the long-term duration of the
underlying policies.

You can also see that, I mean, Hannover Re basically have grown pretty much with the
market, maybe a little bit smaller than the market. But kept our market share unchanged.
This on Life & Health is sometimes a good guide, sometimes a bad guide, because there
are still quite a lot of herds of business in our financial solution practice, which is deposit
accounted. And therefore, it's not visible in the top line, that has been displayed here. So
this is a market by premium and by premium volume. But of course, even more important
is the bottom line, rather than the top line. And if you look at the bottom line, this is the -what you see here is the EBIT of the top 5 reinsurers on the P&C side. These numbers are
relatively easily to be collated because you just look at the balance sheet of the 5 largest
reinsurers, which happened to be all publicly quoted. So you have information available.

Bloomberg Transcript

I mean, the profit pool of the entire market that is estimated here is EUR 20 billion to EUR
25 billion. That is a little bit more difficult to assess. And in fact, the numbers that we have
taken here is extrapolated from the top 5. And it assumes that the profitability of the
entire market is similar to the profitability of the top 5, which tells you that the -- it's a
profit pool, which we here estimate this EUR 20 billion to EUR 25 billion is rather an
optimistic view, most likely. So you better look at the lower part of the bracket. And then
you can see that we are in a EUR 20 billion business. And that's of course, what we try to
grow, is our participation in that profit pool, that's what we consider to be -- what we
consider to mean growth of market share. You can see that we've been at least as a
percentage of their profit pool, relatively successful throughout the soft market years. If
you look at our participation and the profit pool of the 5 largest reinsurers, we managed
to increase that from 12% to 17%. And which is also quite reassuring, as that is, the growth
of the bottom line, outpace the growth of the top line, which of course, is for us quite,
quite important.
Well I mean, that's something, which for us, as I said is quite important. You can also see
that due to the soft market environment, the overall profit development of the reinsurers
on the P&C side has not been overly exciting. If you look at the Life & Health side, the
situation is a little bit more favorable or quite a bit more favorable, when it comes to the
development of the profits. Again, here we take the profits of the top 5 reinsurers. But of
course, differently than with P&C on the Life & Health, that captures the majority of the
business. And you can also see that the profit pool of the Life & Health is about 20% of
the profit pool on the P&C side. You can also see that the EBIT margin that on average is
achieved on P&C is around 10% to 12.5%, whilst on life & Health is more about 5% to 6%.
So it is a Life & Health is a business, which is a slimmer margin as a percentage of
premium. But of course, also the capital bound by that business is also lower than it is with
the P&C side, because it is less volatile.
If you look at our numbers, I mean, we kept our participation of the profit pool of the top
5 reinsurers stable. And again, our profitability increased in line with the growth of the
premium. And this is despite the fact that, particular in the more recent year, we saw
some problems with our mortality solutions business in the U.S. and after the coffee
break, I will give you some more insight into that.
If you look at the market, as a whole, you can see that both the insurance and the
reinsurance market is growing. Don't be confused that we have different market sizes of
the reinsurance and in the previous slides. This is just a different top-down assessment.

And the truth is presumably somewhere in the middle. But directionally, it's -- that's what's
happening. The reinsurance market grows at a smaller pace than the insurance market.
But it does grow. And the average session rate. So the percentage of the primary
premium that is transferred to the reinsurers is around just under 10%. So around 1/10th of
the premium is being ceded to reinsurers. I would say in and large, I mean, that is
certainly, less than the primary markets pay for distribution. But that's where we are. So it's
a much smaller market than the insurance market. And it's a slower growing market than
the insurance market.
If I come to the Life & Health side. On the Life & Health business, you can see that, there
is -- the growth is stalling a little bit on the primary insurance market. That of course, has
to do with the low interest rate environments, that many of the savings products that are
prevailing in the Life & Health business, particularly in the life business have become less
attractive to the customer. And therefore, the growth has not been quite as pronounced
as it was in the past. On the contrary, on the reinsurance side, there you see a slightly
more pronounced growth. And the reason for that is, that on the reinsurance side in and
large, we are not dealing with the savings part of the business. But we are dealing with
the biometric risk. And therefore, we see somewhat more pronounced growth in the
reinsurance market than in the insurance market. The cession rate, which on the P&C side
was about 10%, on Life & Health is only about 3%. And the reason for that low cession
rate, largely of course, is because we are not participating as a reinsurer in the savings
part of the policies.
So that gives you a little bit on the universe we are working in. For us, of course,
strategically, a basic question, is this a good business to be in? Or should we take our
money and do something else with it? And I'll be coming on that in a minute. When we
approached our strategy revision, this time, we were looking at the strategic alternatives,
because there are always alternatives to everything. And of course, strategy is to decide,
which option you want to go and to which option you don't want to go. There are things
like, shall we, I mean, broaden our pond we are swimming in. So shall we like most of our
competitors do, enter the primary market? Like question, shall we be the Ryanair of the
reinsurance, a low-cost provider. I mean, Ryanair is quite successful until recently. So I can't
say this with that much confidence any longer, or shall we just be more efficient? Those
kind of questions, we are asking ourselves. And as that are depicted here. And I would
come to those. This gives you our strategic cycle. I mean, the basis why we relook of our
strategy every three years, of course, is the changes in our market environment. So time
changes, market participant changes, market dynamics change. And of course, we have
to adapt our strategy according to that.
And I should also dwell a little bit on our headline, which here is named our vision, which is
creating value through reinsurance. As you know since the last 10 years, about we start to
give our strategy cycles headlines, like we have to, I mean, being sustainable, successful
in a competitive business. We are growing Hannover Re profitably. And this time, we say
creating values through reinsurance. But that really should say, that we see reinsurance as
an attractive field to be in. And that reinsurance is our core business. That's the message
we want to give, in particular, to our clients. And therefore, we came up with this headline.
But is reinsurance really an attractive business to be in? And there are few considerations.
First of all, we feel that reinsurance is a valuable product for our clients. For many reasons,

Page 5 of 76

FINAL

Company Ticker: H N R1 GR Equity

one of course, is that you can improve as an insurer, your cost of capital by buying
reinsurance. And reinsurance is the only way to do that with a 1-year contract. If you want
to improve your cost of capital by taking out hybrid capital, you're at least bound for 10
years, any shorter duration would not give you the capital credit. And the other thing,
which makes reinsurance attractive when it comes to capital management, it affects the
capital required rather than the capital that we have. In Solvency II terms, it can reduce the
SCR. And therefore, it's quite efficient, if you want to improve your cost of capital and the
amount of profit stream, you can write this -- with this business.
Secondly, of course, you can, I mean, reduce the volatility of your earnings as the primary
insurer. And this probably is the most common reason why reinsurance is being
purchased, because stakeholders in insurance companies, like in other corporation, don't
like volatile earnings. For the most part, they like to see rather stable development of the
earnings and ideally going to the top right of the graph. And also, of course, you can
benefit as an insurer from the experience of your reinsurer when it comes to enter into
new products or into new lines of business where you haven't been before in. So we feel
it's an attractive value proposition to the insurance industry. We also feel that the structure
and the way reinsurance is being bought as a business to business. This professionals of
the same profession so to say, is structurally quite different to the way insurance is being
bought.
There is still growth in the market. And the growth in the market is of course, because it's
an attractive proposition. And therefore, we are not in a shrinking market, if we are active
in the reinsurance field. At the same time, due to the fact that writing a global reinsurance
book is a lot less onerous from a regulatory point of view than writing a global insurance
book. Reinsurance is structurally a competitive business. That's particularly true for the
P&C business that the entrants hurdle is low. And distribution is easy through the
reinsurance brokers. So we will have to live with the fact, that there will always be a
directionally more supply than demand for the product. However, it's a rational
competition. And the reason that the competition is rational in reinsurance is because, the
players in the reinsurance field are largely publicly quoted on investment funds when it
comes to the ILS markets. Therefore, none of us or hardly any of us, maybe some stateowned entity is a different story. But then see players that are most influential on the
reinsurance markets cannot tolerate losses for an extended period. Because if earnings
become unsatisfactory, as the management of the reinsurance companies and the ILS
funds come under pressure from their stakeholders. And therefore, stakeholders and
shareholders. And therefore, they have to do something about it.
As a consequence and we have seen that in the past, we can expect that reinsurance
terms and conditions will increase after bad results in the reinsurance market. And of
course, the question is, what does that mean for us? For market players that are -- can
develop competitive advantages. So we being better in a competition, more successful in
the competition than the average player in the market, reinsurance offers the opportunity
for profitable growth. And due to that conclusion, we feel that reinsurance is a business
we should be in and where we can be successful, like we have been in the past.
Of course, that basic question, as I said, you need to have competitive advantages in that
business, to be sustainably successful. How are we, as Hannover Re, positioned in that
Page 6 of 76

FINAL

market? Are we positioned in that market, that we can be successful or not? And you will
not be surprised, if I tell you that our conclusion has been, that we're well positioned in
that market.
Firstly, we belong to the top 3 reinsurers worldwide. So we're top-tier reinsurer. And as
you have seen at the beginning of my presentation, the growth of the top reinsurers
outpaces the market. So there we are in the right place. And it is actually true to say that
size matters in reinsurance. Because the ceding companies have a buyers wanting to
place their business with the larger reinsurers. Also, the demands of the insurance
companies towards their reinsurers is for more holistic coverage because it's more
efficient, when it comes to capital optimization in solvency regimes, such as Solvency II or
similar risk-based solvency regimes. Such multi-class multi-territory covers, of course, are
easier to buy from the reinsurer that is active in all those classes and territories. And
rather than buying from a number of smaller specialty niche players. Therefore, it's a value
in belonging to the largest reinsurers.

Bloomberg Transcript

Very tangible advantage that we have to our competitors, is our lower expense ratio,
lower admin expense ratio, also lower total expense ratio, including acquisition cost that
allows us to be competitive. More competitive than our competition. And still being able
to create a good margin for our shareholders.
Being cost-efficient is not everything. But it's an important element of being competitive.
We have consistent underwriting approach that also has to do with the fact that we have
particularly in Hannover Re relatively low fluctuation ratio of our employees. And we have
very long-standing client relationship, some of them date back decades. That helps,
because reinsurance still is a people's business, it's a relationship business. And
therefore, here we clearly have an advantage compared to any new entrant to the
market.
Of course, we have certification between Life & Health and P&C business, which should
allow us to write a larger profits stream on the same capital base compared to
competitors that either write P&C only or Life & Health only. And we of course, compared
to those, we have an opportunity to have better return on equities. And well, I mean, we
have of course, we offer tailor-made solutions to our clients, we also of course, pride
ourselves of being solution minded and execution-focused. All in all, we feel that
Hannover Re is well positioned to compete successfully in the reinsurance market, which
is our chosen field of activity. Of course, when we look at our strategy, we also have to
look what our competitors do? What the other market participants do? Because we
cannot assume that we are much more clever than them. Therefore, for us it's important
to understand, how their business model looks. And in recent years in particular, we have
seen that many of our competitors have broadened their universe of the business, they
are in by being more active in the insurance, rather than in the reinsurance business. For
us, of course, that begs the question, shall we go the same route? And shall we also see
insurance and reinsurance as, I mean, business as which we give equal weight to in
Hannover Re. Of course, by concentrating on reinsurance, we have -- we still see that we
can generate good earnings, particularly with our position. And I think I have explained that
on the previous slides. And if you concentrate on reinsurance, we also feel that we have 1
advantage, that we are not competing with our clients. And I also have to admit that being

FINAL

part of the Talanx group, which I was told has some reinsurance, some insurance
somewhere. We would not be well-suited to compete with them fiercely in the insurance
field.
The fact that we are not competing with our clients, we see that little bit more in our
business relationship with some of our major clients who are interested to work more with
us as a reinsurer, not competing with them, compared to some of our peers. And that of
course, is a good opportunity for us to increase our involvement with some of them,
where we know the business and where we can see that the business is favorable for us
from a profitability point of view. Conclusion of that is that, reinsurance remains a core
business of Hannover Re. We have some involvement in the insurance field as well. But
this is seen not as equally important than our reinsurance activity. But at seeing as a
complement, complementing our core business and we write a limited amount of primary
business in 2 areas. One would be coinsurance business on large commercial accounts,
which is quite similar to our facultative business from a structure point of view. And we
also write some niche business through partners, particular agencies and underwriting
agencies. And distribution channels, which is business that is generally not reinsured.
What does that mean for our business model? It is our aim to expand our market share in
the reinsurance field, which is our core business. We feel over the long to medium-term -medium to long-term we are in the position to do that. And if we are talking increasing
market share, of course, the aim is to increase our share in the profit pool that the
reinsurance market offers to us. Also, within the reinsurance business, we have a broad
focus. We focus all lines, all territories. We want to write all the business that fulfills our
margin requirements. The reason for that is, if we would have, which we also could do,
the approach of a specialist reinsurer that would of course, narrow our focus in the
reinsurance field, which already is only like 6% of the insurance market. And we feel, as a
specialist, on parts of the reinsurance segment, focused reinsurer, he will not be able to
be one of the leading reinsurers, which as I told you before, we attribute a value of -- in
being one of the leading reinsurers. Therefore, broad approach on the reinsurance. And
primary only in selective niche markets. We continue. And we will continue to write both
Life & Health and P&C reinsurance to generate the diversification benefits. And as we
see, profit opportunities for us in both business groups. We will maintain our cost
advantage, despite the fact that it needs a constant effort. And we are solutionorientated reinsurer. So we want to create value with our clients by giving them innovative
solutions that allows them to be more successful than they would be when they would not
deal with us. And of course, we have developed a digital strategy, not only because it's
quite fashionable to do that. But also because digitalization will have a major influence
also on our business.
These are our strategic principles, which I will dwell on rather briefly looking at the time.
First one is our profit goals. And economic growth targets. And of course, we crystallized
those in the target metrics. And we have made some changes to the target metrics.
Some realizing that the economic numbers are gradually becoming more important in
relation versus the IFRS numbers, because up until recently, our stakeholders were mainly
judging the success or failure of our activities based on the IFRS group numbers. But since
Solvency II has been enacted. And we also publicizing the economic capital adequacy ratio
or economic capital ratio, the economic numbers have become more to the forefront.

Page 8 of 76

And we felt that we should also recognize that with our growth targets. So the valuecreation, which previously we had based on the IFRS, we now base that on the change in
the economic capital as depicted in our internal model plus the dividend. And we added,
as a group target, the solvency ratio of 200% as a target, which is a threshold where the
limit is 200%.
The return on equity target is unchanged. It's still the 900 base points over and above
IFRS 3, since you see here a downward arrows is only due to the fact that the interest
rates are continuing to decrease because it's an average interest rate over five years.
And that is still coming down. The reduced interest rate is also the main reason why we
took the earnings per share growth target down from 6.5% to 5%. The return on
investment is stable at -- sorry, 7.5%, that would be great, 2.7% and Roland will tell you
later that there is a stabilization in our expected return on investment despite the fact that
we have a continued low-interest rate environment.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the P&C side, all targets unchanged. And on the Life & Health side, we all now see IVC
targets and growth target (inaudible). And instead of having an EBIT margin target, we
changed it to an EBIT growth target. That has to do due to the fact that with deposit
accounted treaties and some other particularities of the Life & Health business, we feel
that the EBIT growth target is more telling than an EBIT margin target.
Second, of course, for us to be successful, it's quite important to be a preferred business
partner of our client. And of course, here our credit rating helps and we pride ourself of
best execution within our peer group. And this is also due to the fact that we have no
matrix organization. But we give the power of decision to the client-facing underwriter.
And that allows us to execute all the complex transactions more timely and with a higher
certainties than some of our competitors.
Services we provide. But we are not providing unbundled services. But services that we
provide should be strictly linked to business opportunities where we generate premiums
and profit streams.
Being a service provider, our employees are most important for us. And we think we are
best, best -- we have the best success as a company if our employees are successful.
Therefore, we strive this in Hannover Re to have a corporate culture where the individual
employee can experience success in their day-to-day business. And that also has to do
with the fact that we delegate decision taking to the -- to our employees and not have a
matrix organization. Of course, we have controls in place regarding that decision taking of
our employees. You can also see that we have a wide variety of specialists that we need
to write our reinsurance business, such as medical doctors, we have engineers, we have
mathematicians and a few other professions. But what we feel that increasingly we will
also need skilled profiles that allow us to be successful in a more digitalized world.
As far as our investment strategy, the broad questions that we asked ourselves when we
set up the strategy: Shall we go to a hedge-fund-style reinsurance? To say, for us, the
assets have a higher value than for our competition because we could generate higher
return. Or should we continue with the conservative strategy where we say what if you

FINAL

invest in Hannover Re, you get an insurance company rather than an investment fund. And
we decided that we will stay with the traditional measured risk strategy and not trying to
generate significant alphas through high-risk taking on our assets.
Risk management. Of course, we defined in our risk strategies the risk position that we
want to take. And that, of course, defines all the distribution of our capital to the various
activities and subsegments. And in the end, to the individual treaty is all based on the risk
position that we define for Hannover Re. The risk position is defined by the solvency ratio
of at least 180% versus 200% threshold. It is defined by a ruin probability of 0.03%. So 1 in
every 3,333 years, we tolerate to be bankrupt. And it is also defined by a probability of
having an IFRS profit in 9 out of 10 years. So that defines our risk position. And this is in line
with a AA rating.
That is also then, of course, the starting point for our risk strategy and for our risk
management activities.

Capital management is, for us, very important. Of course, we want to have sufficient
amount of capital first and foremost that we fulfill the expectations of our clients. That's
very important because only if the clients feel that we give them a secured promise to
pay, only then they will place their long tail and also their best business. So that's very
important for us. Second, we, of course, we need to fulfill the regulatory requirements
and the rating agency requirements for our desired ratings. And we also need to have
some more capital than just fulfilling those requirements because we want to have capital
available to enlarge our use of capital in case that, let's say, our market opportunities.
On the other side, of course, we want to generate attractive ROEs. So we only want to
have that much capital that is in line with the profit that we can generate so that we have
an attractive ROE compared to our peers. And of course, that is achieved by below
average cost of capital. And of course, if we have higher ROEs and higher rate of
profitability, we are seen as a successful corporation, which for us is important. Of course,
for our shareholders, it is important. But also for our clients and for all our employees.
Because also for the employees, it's more attractive to work with a successful corporation
than with an unsuccessful corporation. And also our clients preferred to place their
business in successful corporations rather than unsuccessful corporations.
What are the tools that we are using in order to reduce the cost of capital we use? Hybrid
capital and retrocessions. And in order to manage our capital, the size of our capital, we
use special dividends. The use of special dividends has been newly introduced to our
strategy. Here you can see it.
Then, on the expenses, you can see that our expense ratio is still significantly lower than
the expense ratio of our peers -- the average expense ratio of our peers. And you can
see that this is true both for the expense ratio, including distribution expenses as well as
for the expense ratio -- the pure admin expense ratio. You can also see that the admin
expense ratio of the industry is actually trending downwards. But the average commission
ratios have trended upwards. And this, of course, has to do with the softening market.
And also has to do with the fact that the demand for reinsurance in the soft market has

been more geared towards proportionate reinsurance rather than nonproportionate
reinsurance.
That brings me to our IT strategy. We want to generate an efficient support of our
business by sufficient IT. And I mean, here I would just want to mention that we use the
same reinsurance administration system in most of our locations worldwide, in all the
locations that write close to 80% of our premium. And this allows us to generate quite a
lot of efficiencies, particular when it comes to the new and ever-increasing reporting
requirements if we have to regulate us and other stakeholders.

Bloomberg Transcript

We also have created a digital strategy, 2 goals there: one, generate new business,
reinsuring start-ups of these so-called InsurTechs, supporting our clients along the value
chain with digital solutions and writing the new risks, such as cyber and understanding the
silent cyber as it is called more thoroughly. And of course, increase efficiencies of our own
processes. And we have initiated a few projects to become even more efficient than in
the past.
Sustainability and compliance, for us, very important. Again, for reasons, we want to be a
good corporate citizen. We want to meet the requirements of our clients. There are more
and more clients that have a sustainability strategy of themselves. They expect the same
from their service providers. We want to be investigable for investors that look for
environmental or socially responsible companies. And we want to be an attractive
employer. And in order to achieve that, we are also prepared to forgo short-term profit to
make sure that is actually a serious effort that we are doing in this respect. And the tool to
put our strategy in action is our performance excellence management system where each
of the units, each department, each subsidiary, each brand has to define the contribution
to the strategy. They also have to define the KPIs for executing the strategy. All that is
done through what we call a strategy cockpit, which is a nice IT system that also allows us
to aggregate all these strategic contributions and see if they are successful and actually
sufficient to achieve our strategic goals as a group.
With that, I would conclude my presentation and look forward to your questions. Thank
you very much.

Questions And Answers

I'm sure you have some questions. But please wait for the microphone, which will be
handed by (Andrea) and (Catherine). The first one from Frank Kopfinger.

Q - Frank Kopfinger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

My question would be on the additional strategy. Can you be a little bit more precise here
in respect to how many InsurTechs you already back in this respect? Are we only talking
about reinsurance capacity? Or are you also acting as a investor in these InsurTechs? Then
on the other part, on the IT investments overall to digitalize your reinsurance business

model, can you provide us with a figure as to how much you have set in IT budget that
you are going to spend towards this impact going forward the numbers?

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

Yes. Firstly, on the InsurTechs, I would say we reinsure a handful of them, maybe, 2
handfuls. That's, of course, one of our strategies. If there are new risk carriers, they are, of
course, potential clients. And that's what we are looking at. We, of course, also support
them with our know-how and our resources. We also invest in some of them. We have
investments, for example, in the U.S., where we invest in one of the Silicon Valley
InsurTechs, like, Sureify. We also, in Germany, for example, we work with (Finley), which is a
business built in Berlin. And (is there) we have an investment. And we also have
investments in specific startups. So it's a little bit of both. But always there's a few of
improving, I mean, generating business and generating reinsurance business for
Hannover Re.
Expenses. While for us as we -- where we improve our own systems that's part of our
overall IT budget. But of course, there is an increasing number for digitalization. For
example, we developed a point-of-sale system in Germany for the Life & Health business.
And we invested in this EUR 20 million. But this will not increase our expense ratio
dramatically. And one of the reason is that we are -- there's a difference between
reinsurance and insurance, in particular personal lines insurance. Because in the insurance,
of course, the number of transactions is very, very high. So complete automatization of
the end-to-end processes is absolutely crucial to continue to be competitive in this
business. In the reinsurance side, of course, the number of transaction is lot less.
Therefore, the automation is easier to achieve. And is less, less competitive. It's a smaller
competitive factor. That said, we, for example, are looking for our Bermuda nonlife
company to see if we -- to what extent we can automate the entire end-to-end
processes. And the reason that we took Bermuda, it's a relatively small organization with
something like 27 employees. But they have all the processes. I mean, they have
underwriting, they have pricing, they have modeling. And of course, then they have cash
accounting, balance sheet accounting. And of course, technical accounting. So it is really
like from an automation point of view -- I mean, it's really like a sandbox. So from that
point of view, we have taken that.

Okay. Next question coming from Kamran. And then we follow with Vinit.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Just 1 question on the target matrix, the EPS growth target for 2018 and onwards. Can you
just talk us through what the starting point for that 5% or above greater is that 2017
adjusted for hurricanes or kind of what that says? Then in terms of your assumptions built
into that, what are we thinking on premium growth and the kind of future opportunities
going into next year? It seems like there might be some kind of change in the market. Is
any of that baked into your assumptions on the 5%-plus EPS growth?

Company N ame: H annover Rueck SE

Yes. I mean, the growth target is just developed by our premium growth targets and our
margin requirements. And that, of course, is harmonized with the 96% target combined
ratio or below 96%. And of course, in Life & Health not very simple because we have a 5%
EBIT growth targets there as well. So that should, of course, translate in a 5% increase as
well. But this is just taken out of the various numbers that you see in the target matrix and
the idea is that they are to harmonize them so that if you achieve the premium growth
targets plus the margin targets, that would result in a 5% increase of our EPS. Of course, if
we have a higher interest rate that in itself taken -- if the technical targets are unchanged
would create a larger growth of the EPS because the assets under management are
about 2.5x the growth premium and, like, 3x the net premium. So from that point of view,
it's just trying to harmonize the targets within the target matrix. Of course, I mean, if we
would try for 10% increase in top line, keeps the same margin requirement, of course, we
would then also have higher growth targets. Conversely, if we want to have no growth
targets, there could also be no growth targets of the EPS if the profit margin generated is
stable. Then when it comes to 2018 -- I mean, 2017, it's unlikely that we will achieve an EPS
growth. And we, of course, we guided that already. Because with the hurricane losses
likely to exceed the large loss budget that would, of course, mean that one of the
preconditions for our profit guidance is in danger or may not be met, which is -- that the
large losses remain within the budget. But if they are excess of the budget, it has a
negative influence on the earnings per share. So that is something I have say for 2017. For
2018, of course, we are expecting, on the P&C side, a better trading conditions, which, of
course, then should mean that the EPS growth in 2018. Again, if the large losses behave
and the capital markets behave, we should, of course, for 2018, on a stand-alone basis,
the EPS growth should be double-digit, partly also because 2017 will be below
expectation.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Vinit from Mediobanca. Just clarifying again, all these downgraded matrix numbers, do
they include any optimism from your side on what the hurricane opportunities would be or
cat opportunities could be? Or are these just a base case. And then, we have to top it up
with what we imagine you could do? So that's the first question. Second question is just on
Slide 18. Again, it's linked to that. We know that you look at NatCat capacity as a
percentage in terms of risk capital, which used to be 18%. Is that going to change going
forward?

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

First of all, you see the target matrix is a base case. That said, the target combined ratio
is, of course, more a combined ratio over the cycle. We feel that we can achieve that
combined ratio every year if the large losses behave because in those years where we
are able to achieve better technical results -- at least, in the past, we have built up the
redundancies and our loss reserves. And that allows us to keep the technical result stable
even in a soft market. For 2018, of course, we feel that the market condition should be
sufficient to generate our desired profits without resulting to taking out of the redundancy
buffers. As far as the natural catastrophe budget is concerned, as we have excess capital,
we're quite flexible on that. I mean, we could increase that as we feel fit. For the time
being, we haven't changed the large loss budget and the national catastrophe budget for
next year, mainly because it's an evolving situation. And we have to see 2 things. First of
all, to what extent can we continue to place our retrocession contract. And to what extent
Page 13 of 76



Company N ame: H annover Rueck SE
Company Ticker: H N R1 GR Equity
Date: 2017-10-19

we are actually will be seeing rate increases on the property cat side. So later, we are
pretty sure -- and therefore, it is relatively likely that by year-end, you will see that we
have increased our national catastrophe budget to some extent.

Well Paris, take the microphone.

Q - Paris Hadjiantonis

Paris from CrÃ©dit Suisse. Sorry, I'm going again back to the target matrix and looking at
EBIT growth for Life & Health, where you've changed that from an EBIT margin. Can you
give some details on the split by sharp business, let's say. So I think you have alluded to
the fact that financial solutions business, for example, are doing better. Are you expecting
that EBIT growth is coming mainly from financial solutions rather than mortality or U.S.
mortality? And the second question is on the dividend and specifically where you say that
a special dividend is integrated into the new strategy. I'm not exactly sure how you define
now an ordinary dividend versus a special dividend. So at what point would you be not
willing to pay a special dividend? Basically, would that be a payout ratio above 100 or
something else?

A - Ulrich Wallin

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 19703051 <GO>}

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

Second question, first. We would not pay a special dividend if we cannot finance a
dividend out of the IFRS profitability. So -- I mean, if IFRS profitability is below our dividend
including special, then, of course, we would not pay a special. We would also if we don't
make money or if you have a loss, we will not pay a special dividend. Because you need to
see 2 things here: one is the continuity of the dividend. The continuity of the dividend
should under all circumstances be the base dividend. And in most of the years, we should
be able to pay a special dividend. The other thing is that we would also not pay a special
dividend if there are extraordinary good opportunities to grow our business, like, for
example, if we have opportunities like we have seen in 2002, the significant profitable
growth opportunities. In that case, we would also not pay a special dividend. But we don't
think that 2018 will be similar to 2002. Of course, when we go to the first question
regarding the split of the EBIT growth on the various subsegments, it, of course, applies
to all subsegments, admittedly if I look on U.S. mortality from a rather low base and if I
look at U.S. financial solutions from a higher base. But I can tell you that our ambitions on
the financial solution business is more a double-digit EBIT growth every year. Otherwise,
of course, as it's relative target now, it's -- I mean, it applies to all subsegments.

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. First, one remark on the target matrix because this is not getting any
better. And on the target matrix -- because the target matrix is not a guidance for next
year. It's a mid-term target. It's our mid-term target. So the aim is, if we look back on a 10;
or 15-year period or 5; or 10-year period and look at the development of our earnings and
premiums, they should be within the targets of the target matrix. It's not a target that we
expect to achieve in any given year but it's mid-term target. So I mean, if you have a soft
P&C market, for example, we have no ambition to grow by 3% to 5%. If the market is very
soft, we may as well shrink our P&C book. However, if the market is very favorable, we, of
course, aim to grow more than 3% to 5%. So it's a mid-term target that I meant here.
When it comes to 2018, of course, it remains what we set all along that the underlying
profitability that we are able with our business model to generate is more than EUR 1
billion net income. That we already said that the last couple of years. And that hasn't
changed. Again, this is not a profit guidance either.
So that brings me now to the issues. And I start with an update on the natural catastrophe
losses, which have been much talked about. And of course, let's look at the losses of the
Third Quarter. Of course, we have Hurricane Harvey, which was the first one in August.
And you can see that the estimates on Harvey are quite wide ranging. I mean, the lowest
estimate is from CoreLogic, $7.5 billion and it goes up to $40 billion on our math. And
same is true with Irma that $25 billion is the lowest number, $55 billion is the highest
number. And of course, the largest is currency we have on Hurricane Maria, where the
numbers go -- anywhere from $15 billion to $85 billion. So you can see there is a lot of
uncertainty in the final -- in those 3 numbers on all of these. That means that if you take it
all together, we have a range here from $49 billion to $183 billion. The 2 sides of the
equation have very, very different consequences for the market. If we are at $183 billion,
that would mean that assuming 50% of this being reinsured, we would have 45 additional
loss ratio points to the P&C business, which, of course, clearly would be a capital event
rather than an earnings event for the market. Because if you assume that the large loss -the expected large loss -- expected large losses for the market are just under 10%, it
would add about 35, I mean, combined ratio points -- to the target combined ratios. And
yes, I mean, that would not -- you would not be able to bridge that investment income.
Conversely, the lower end of that bracket is $49 billion. You are pretty much in the range,
as I said, we have seen, say, in 2016 and in previous years. So then -- I mean, it would
clearly be only an earnings event and pretty much the losses, if that's the case, would be
covered within the large loss budget, the majority of the losses. So you can see there is a
very high range of uncertainty in these. And also, this uncertainty gives you uncertainty
about the market reactions.
What does that mean for us? We still feel it's a little bit early to give you concrete
numbers. The only thing, which we already said and said remains true is that our profit
target is under threat, under challenge. So to say, because of the combination of the large
losses and particular about this potentially happening in the Fourth Quarter, I mean, could
clearly result in the fact that our large loss budget is not sufficient to cover the actual large
losses. And as I said before, that is one of the preconditions for our profit guidance.

FINAL

We will, however, give you numbers when we report on our Third Quarter figures because
we have to book numbers. Then if we book the numbers, we may as well give them to
you.
Well I mean, we have comprehensive retrocession cover. And the way we currently look at
the losses, the majority of those retrocessions will still be in place. What that means is our
current assessment is very well safeguarded for further increase in future because if the
losses increase further from our -- from the current assessment of the market or our
assessment, then our retrocession cover would come into play to reduce the effect that,
that would have on Hannover Re. And of course, we expect for us and we are pretty
certain that this will be an earnings issue rather than a capital issue.
Then of course, the question is what does that do for the market? And how does this look
in comparison to what happened in the past? If you look at this chart, you can see that you
have had in the last 17 years, about every 5 to six years, you had a year with major cat
losses. And it's also quite interesting. But this is just the chance that the large losses were
normally preceded by a year with already losses that were slightly above the long-term
average.

Bloomberg Transcript

And so from that point of view, we can compare 2017 a little bit with 2011 and 2005
because the quantum of loss will be there or thereabouts if you look at all the losses, all
the national catastrophe losses of the entire year. You can also see that following major
losses normally these loses behave. But there is no guarantee that this will always be the
case.
So what happened in case of these large losses? Look at 2005, the average ROE of the
10 largest insurance companies, which write at least 50% of their business through
reinsurance, dropped to 2.2%. And that meant, that you saw a reaction on the market,
which was actually as depicted with the Guy Carpenter Rate-On-Line Index for national
catastrophe business. So you can see that following the losses in 2005 and the resulting
unacceptably low ROE of the reinsurance industries, prices increased. But so did the ROE,
which then, of course, in 2006, reached very attractive levels. And as even the 2005
hurricanes were not dislocated -- did not result in a dislocated market. You can see that
the prices after that peaked relatively quickly, I mean, went sliding again. Then you have
2008. And 2008 is interesting, because 2008 was not a year where you had particularly
high natural catastrophe losses. Nevertheless, the financial crisis resulted in a breakeven
result for the industries. And that, of course, was an unacceptably low ROE for the
industry. And it had an effect on the -- on all of the business, which you can see in 2009.
This effect is a little bit larger than you look at it at the overall reinsurance business not just
the natural catastrophe business. Because in 2009, the increases were rather broadbased. They were basically on all classes because a lot of the market players became
very risk averse. Then, of course, 2009, again, the year ROE was very attractive. And so
we saw the rates starting to slide from 2010 into 2011. And 2011, then we, of course, had
the New Zealand earthquakes and the Japanese earthquake as well as the Thai floods.
That, again, resulted in a rather broad-based increase in rates. And the 2012 level has
actually been -- for the overall reinsurance market have been quite acceptable level. I
mean, if you get that level, we would be very happy. And you could see that the market

Page 16 of 76

FINAL

remained quite stable in 2013 only to start to slide, again, from 2014 onwards due to the
fact that there was no volatility in the RoEs since 2017.
Of course, for 2017, depending where the losses end up in that bracket between EUR 49
billion and EUR 183 billion, the RoE of the industry will drop on the mid-term probably
again below 5% and that should result in change in the market sentiment and that should
result in rate increases in 2018. And we're already seeing some of that now, particularly on
the facultative side and some of the London market business where you already see a
much firmer markets than we had three months ago.
So this is as the U.S. -- so sorry, it is the worldwide catastrophe business and the facts of
what we have seen in the Third Quarter. Still a lot of uncertainty. But we can expect overall
to be -- to be more favorable trading conditions into 2018, which, of course, should allow
us to deliver improved profitability on our 2018 fiscal and underwriting year on the P&C
side. That brings me to the second issue I want to talk about, which is the U.S. mortality
business. And we have reported, consistently, I would say, at least, over the last 36
months, is that we had worse-than-expected results from our U.S. mortality business, in
particular relating to the business that we have bought from Scottish Re at the end of -- at
the beginning of 2009, the so-called ING block. And of course, the question is why is that
business underperforming and why it looks that the performance that our U.S. mortality
business displays looks comparatively bad compared to our peers? I would first like to
direct you to the left side of the slide. And the basic challenges that we have with the U.S.
mortality business is twofold. One is higher-than-expected mortality at old ages, particular
ages over 85. And secondly, is anti-selective lapse and anti-selective use of policyholder
options, is that the policyholders have in -- in the primary policies and that have an effect
on the emergence of the experience of the reinsurance.
And both phenomena realize themselves at the latest stage of the development of an
underwriting year. Because if you write new business, let's say, if I write new business in
2017. So I write a block of mortality business based on the reinsurance rates. So-called YRT
rate -- rate-driven facility, of course, in the early years, I mean, it's very unlikely that I will
have higher-than-expected mortality. Because -- I mean the insurers that I cover with my
reinsurance are relatively young. And they have just gone through a medical underwriting
process. So I can assume that the probability that they survive the next 10 years is
extremely high outside accidental death.
Also early on, the insurers have limited options in the policies that can negatively impact
on the experience of the book of business. That changes over time, particular on business
that is, in the end, permanent business. So it's a policy that remains in duration until the
insured passes away. Because if it's a term policy that is being bought, at the end of the
term, the policyholder has a variety of options. One of the options is that he can convert,
in many cases, that policy to a permanent plan. If he does that, there is no new
underwriting. So his classification addressed is still based on the underwriting performed
like 10 or 20 years or 15 years ago. So if he was super preferred at that time, he still gets
a super preferred risk rate 20 years later. That, of course, opens the portfolio for antiselection because if his health has deteriorated, the converting the policy to a permanent
is clearly his best -- is his best option if he wants to continue to be covered.

Page 17 of 76

The other option he has not to lapse the policy, the so-called post-level. I mean, avail
himself the availability to have the post-level term coverage. Post-level term coverage, of
course, there is an assumption of the market that it is anti-selective because the market
assumes that it is anti-selective, you get a higher -- a much higher rate than you have
been paying through the term period. Of course, you have to pay higher rates anyhow
because you are lot older now. But also there's an assumption that if you are very healthy,
you will not continue with your policy there. But you will lapse. And also, here the
assumption of the market was that the post-level premiums may be profitable for the
market because of the higher rate hike and that is not the case. I mean, if the market
assumption for profitability is mainly stemming from the fact that the post-level term
coverage was introduced into the life reinsurance market in order to bolster the
profitability of the overall term-life business.

Bloomberg Transcript

So here you can see that the problems that you have to foresee the U.S. mortality
business, basically backloaded. And of course, they are larger than the -- and average age
of the policyholders is higher. And of course, if you have block like the ING block, which is
closed for new business for like 13 -- 13 years, the problems crystallize on that block more
than it would, otherwise, be.
If you look at the right side of the graph, this is the new business volume and this is the
new business volume, not by premium but by face value. So it's basically is a sum insured
that has newly written by the reinsurers. And I think these figures are always publicized by
Munich Re, therefore, we can take them. But you can see the dark blue line is the new
business production of Hannover Re. And of course, you can see there is an absolute
spike in 2004, which is one of the more difficult underwriting years due to -- due to poor
underwriting of the primary companies at that time. And so we have really, really a
unproportionately high proportion of our business in those difficult years. And we have a
very low -- unproportionately low business from the years, say 2005 to 2012, which were
pretty good years. And therefore, the problem is the U.S. mortality business crystallized in
our portfolio earlier than in the portfolio of our peers, which have a more evenly spread
issuance of new business. You can see that the cession rate has actually been coming
down over time. Therefore, in the newer years, I mean the years in the new business
written is coming down, anyhow. But that's important to understand if you compare our
numbers to the numbers of our competition.
What does that mean? Or what are the initiatives we have taken? I mean, first of all, prior
to 2016, we saw some impact of the negative developments in the U.S. -- the U.S.
mortality business, largely on post-level terms and some based on -- I mean we saw
some issues with suicides following the financial crisis. They've also alleviated a level of
suicides. And those were addressed by enforced management actions. I mean, firstly, on
the coinsurance business, reducing the collateral cost virtually to 0. I mean that on the
modified coinsurance business means that, that is actually quite stable, most of that is
term life anyhow. And so the problems that we have for that business are basically
remedied by the fact that we reduced the collateral costs dramatically. The only problem
we have is that business remaining is the conversions from term to permanent.
We also had some successful rate increases that we exercised over the years that
mitigated the problem. From 2016 onwards, we saw the increasing trend of additional

mortality and that also initiated our projects -- we call our project reboot, which is the
project that you see in the fourth bullet point, where we have an even closer and more
granular look at the developments of that mortality solutions business. So we have come
up by the end of the Third Quarter with a much clearer view on the future expected
losses of that business.
On an IFRS basis, it's important to understand that the assumptions at the time of the
purchase. So-called purchase GAAP are locked in and as long as the value in force of the
U.S. financial solutions business as a whole being a unit of account are being positive, we
will use the unlock -- we have to use the unlocked assumptions on our IFRS reserving, not
on the Solvency II reserving. Solvency II technical provisions reflect the latest view. But on
IFRS, it's the locked-in assumptions.

Bloomberg Transcript

That, of course, on the new -- on the newer business normally provides us with good
profitability, (actually) to expected is normally positive. But on the old block, it means that
we would see negative IFRS earnings because the assumptions that are locked in such as
lower mortality and lower benefits payout than our current best estimate and that, of
course, conceptually would mean that we would have on the ING block, as long as it's not
unlocked and there's no reason to unlock it because if value enforce is positive of the
entire block, we will have negative IFRS results on that.
The problems are largely this -- was almost exclusively with YRT business on permanent
plans. And therefore, whilst the situation is not perfect, we have the ability to remedy the
situation that's enforce management actions, which basically resort to increased rates. We
have the right to increase the rates on YRT. That has to do with the fact that this outset
right, which is -- I mean single option that we have that we don't need to seek a consent
of our client, is the reason that the reinsurers on YRT have set right for rate increases, is
because, otherwise, we would have to put up XXX reserves. If we have had -- if you have
to put up XXX reserves, we have to charge our clients for the collateral costs and
therefore, this rate increases are -- the ability to increase rates by the reinsurer is in the
interest of both the ceding company as well as the reinsurer. Of course, we can only
increase rates where it is truly justifying. I mean there really need to be changes in the
exposures, which have not been taken into account when the business was underwritten,
because all things being equal, of course, the client can assume that we will not increase
rates. That means that over time, the IFRS results will improve for 3 reasons: first of all, I
mean the increased rates will, of course, improve the IFRS results; secondly, as we
increase rates, normally, the right -- the client has the right to recapture the business or
even if he hasn't got the right to recapture the business, we would still probably allow him
to recapture the business. That means that we might have an IFRS in that particular year if
we have a negative reserve on that business. But at the same time, of course, for the
future, the expected losses from the recaptured business will not -- will not materialize,
which would of course, means that the IFRS results will improve; and thirdly, the new
business that we write, as you can see on the -- as you have seen on the first slide, is
increasing. And also, the profitability of the new business is increasing. So the IFRS
earnings of the block should actually improve for those 3 reasons in the medium term,
starting this 2019, where you should start to see the fruits of these actions that we're
undertaking.

This gives you a more granular explanation of the various issues and opportunities that we
have in this business, most of that I already alluded to and that then brings me to one
thing, which is the mortality trend in the U.S. The U.S. life reinsurers. And they price the
business, they would normally price in mortality trend improvement of anywhere between
1% and 1.5%. So they expect that the mortality will improve, which was true for quite a
while and the mortality improvement actually often were more pronounced as them being
priced in by the reinsurers. But you can see that in recent years, they've also -- the trend
of mortality improvements have actually stalled and variety of reasons for that -- one is
that these trends are volatile anyhow over time and the other is there are certain -certain elements, just as increasing use of medicine in the form of drugs, which has an
effect for this mortality trend. Of course, the stalling of the mortality trend, you only feel
that and the actual to expected results if you have a high average age of your
policyholder. If you have a lot of policyholders, say that are older than 85 years, is
anywhere they've seen the effect. And of course, as the ING portfolio, that we required, is
already closed for 2 business for a number of years and is -- I mean has been
underwriting business for many years before. The average age of the ING insurers that
we have is higher than the average age of, say of a reinsured life in the market.
Therefore, you have the crystallization on the ING portfolio. It also allows us, of course, to
take more proactive actions.
Conclusion. The majority of the problems, as I said, exist on YRT businesses permanent
plans or conversions to permanent plans and the majority of those can be addressed by
enforce management actions. That will be -- we plan to execute that we already have
executed a number of those in 2016 and '17. But there is a plan of acceleration of this
execution in 2018. We expect recaptures of that, which will create some volatility in the
IFRS earnings, particularly in 2018 and maybe, spilling over a little bit in 2019. But after that
we should be done with that because based on our project work, we feel that we are in a
position to have a rather precise view on the expected mortality. So that we can tailor
make the rate increase that we only need to do it once and not come back, say, some
years later and hit the client again, with the rate increase, which contractually we could. But
that's definitely not what we want to do. And that means that, as I told you, we expect
from 2019 that the profitability of our U.S. -- of mortality business and the overall
performance of the Life & Health business should improve. Because -- I mean the
negative effect of the U.S. mortality business in recent years has been between EUR 100
million and EUR 150 million negative effect on the EBIT. So if you could bring that back to
0, which we should be in the next couple of years and the remaining business performs
as it has been in the previous years, then, of course, you see that there is a lot of room
for significantly improved EBIT from our Life & Health business in the medium terms.
With that, I would end my presentation. And thank you for listening.

FINAL

I'm trying to judge how bullish you are or not on rate increases for, I guess, starting with
general renewals. I mean if we say the industry losses and out of EUR 130 billion for the
whole year. So EUR 100 billion for the hurricanes, what's your best guess at this point for
rate increases in property cat U.S.? and are we talking broader beyond that or just really
isolated property cat?

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

Well our aim would be to bring it back to the 2015 rating levels then. But of course, on
some businesses will mean significant increases like in Florida cat, you would probably
need increases, I would say, 40% to 50%. On other businesses, the increases are -- can
be a lot more modest because we haven't given the rate away to the same extent like on
some of the Continental, European casualty business with a lot less also on the U.S.
casualty business, we would probably more look for rate increases, I would say, around
the 5% level because we haven't given it a raise that drastic.

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

I mean, a lot of the large cedents that have reported losses so far haven't meaningfully
drawn down their reinsurance. So why would they be willing to pay more for -- I know this
is a negotiation game. But it strikes me as unusual that they want to pay more for the U.S.
casualty business, for example?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

Well I mean they have caused us driving for rate increases themselves. And of course,
they only pay a fraction of the premium to the reinsurance. And I mean, certainly, on the
discussions that we have had in the U.S. on the CIB Conference, there isn't a change in
sentiment both on the insurance side as well as on the reinsurance side towards rate
increases. So there is no expectation at this point in time of the clients to fulfill the rate
decreases and I would say you can convince them that you should have at least similar
rate development as they have on their own business. I mean it's just a change in
sentiment, I would say.

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay. Final question, the life EBIT guidance, which, I know, we've moved on from. But it
used to be EUR 350 million or thereabouts. You are saying that would have included EUR
100 million, EUR 150 million negative drag. Is that how we should think about it? Or...

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

More like EUR 100 million negative drag and now we more think about EUR 150 million.

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay. So all the things being equal, your 2019 guidance or maybe 2020, I'm not sure, is
going to be EUR 450 million?

responsible for the life business listening to that and they have tried to achieve that.

FINAL

Okay, we have another question from (Cameron).

Q - Unidentified Participant
I was just wondering if you could give any comments around pricing in retrocession and
kind of what you expect to, say obviously you expect some prices to go up and -- on kind
of (inaudible) you are rising. But what do you expect to hear from your retro providers?

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

Well I think they will probably charge -- starting to charge us more money. Maybe there is
some success. But I would divert this question to JÃ¼rgen's presentation because I think
he would give you some information on that. If you want to give an answer now, JÃ¼rgen,
that's fine as well. But...

A - JÃ¼rgen GrÃ¤ber
Okay, do it now?

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. The only thing, you need a microphone.

A - JÃ¼rgen GrÃ¤ber
Okay. Good. So when you look at retro prices, you have to consider the individual situation
of every retro program. The market is divided by some retro programs, having been hit
severely in 2005, then 2011 and maybe hit again, right now in 2017. They, of course, will
have to expect price increases, I would say. But those who have not had massive hits, say
for example in 2017, may have a very positive bank of yes unused premiums from the
years 2012 to 2015 and '16. And therefore, they will try to negotiate unchanged retro
prices. We are more in the latter group. And surely, I will challenge our teams not to
accept higher retro prices. Whether we succeed, we have to wait and see, yes.

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

It also remains to be seen how the ILS market will perform this season -- the losses that
we have and how the ILS market will perform with the uncertainties that are in the market
at this point in time. Because I mean the retro market is heavily driven by the ILS market, I
would say, at least 50% of the retro capacity is provided by collateralized markets.

A - Karl Steinle

{BIO 1986424 <GO>}

Okay, Vinit has another question.

FINAL

So just on the market pricing commentary, thanks for that. I know it is also a big, sort of,
arranger in the ILS space where it helps to match supply and demand. From your role in
that area in the market, where are you seeing -- what are you seeing happening at the
moment because, obviously, ILS and how they behave and how (collateralized) structures
behave, next three months will be very important to whatever happens to all of us.

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

Well I would say the ILS players are in the process of accessing their position. I think
they're not very many of them that already have concluded their assessment. So we will
know that in three months' time, for sure. We will know it particularly well at Hannover Re
because as you know, we work with a handful of partners in the ILS market where we act
as a transformer for them. And of course -- I mean, they will have to give us new collateral
if they want to continue that partnership. And for us, I mean, if we are willing to do that,
we are continuing to be in business. If they're not willing to do it, then that's fine for us as
well. That would then probably point to hotter market than otherwise.

A - Karl Steinle

{BIO 1986424 <GO>}

Okay. Next one is from Thomas Fossard.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

I have 2 questions. The first one would be on the life side and -- could you put some
numbers behind the U.S. mortality book in terms of what is the size of the portfolio
currently, how much business is running of every single year, just whether any kind of idea
of how the numbers looks like behind the scene? Second question will be on the P&C
side. You recently invested or made the acquisition of Argenta on the (light)market. Can
you say you beat on what you intend to do with Argenta and where you are seeking in
terms of planning process for '18 and '19? It seems to be that, maybe, large market could
be much more dislocated than the insurance market as a whole in the coming quarters?

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

Yes, I mean the size of the premiums that we get from the acquired book, it's still around
$1 billion of premium per year. That's gives you kind of the size there. And of course then, I
mean, what we call the organic growth businesses, the new business, that will be around
$300 million this year, growing double-digit every year. Then we have some other legacy
business from Hannover Re, which is performing largely along this expectation, that will be
probably be another, I would say, $300 million -- $200 million to $300 million. So that's
roughly the size of the U.S. mortality business that we write. On the P&C side with
Argenta, I mean we will -- I agree with your observation that may be the large market is
affected by the losses little bit over-proportionately. And therefore, the reaction will
probably also be more drastic in the large market.
(technical difficulty)
With Argenta, we will increase our exposure, our underwriting capacity with them, partly to
stem capacity of them overall and partly by taking up some of the capacity that have been
given up by some trade capital providers.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

On just capacity can you put -- can you put any provisional number? I mean your
(inaudible) seeking almost 40%, is that the type of things you're willing to do as well?

FINAL

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

No. I mean not that much. Stamp is more like 15% to 20%, yes. I mean, of course, our own
underwriting, we would more than double compared to what we currently have. Because
Argenta, if you remember, I mean the managing agency that we bought, it only -- it only
controlled 21% of the stamp and 9% of the stamp was provided by us already as trade
capital. So that's 30% of the stamp and in -- for 2018, we are likely to have around 50% of
the stamp. Is that correct?

A - JÃ¼rgen GrÃ¤ber
Maybe closer to 40%. But some of it has been 40% and 50%.

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

Good.

{BIO 1986424 <GO>}

Okay. Any further questions? If not, then we will continue with another presentation. So
before we break for lunch, we will listen to what Roland has to say. Deciding on the title of
his presentation is always the easy task because, we just take the one from the previous
year. But coming up with the contents, however, it takes a little more work to do it as we
saw this year. So thank you for all the colleagues who have contributed their support.
Seeing as the 2016 runoff result prompted widespread discussions this year and
numerous assumption, Roland will focus on that topic. And needless to say that we can't
get away with an update on the investment side as well. Well with that, I'll hand over.
+++presentation

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you, Karl. Welcome also from my side. This is now a rather sharp cut from the
strategy and market-moving events to the nitty-gritty on my desk. We -- this presentation
has a little bit the tradition to have this title. I was asked already last night, what is really on
the CFO's desk today? And we spoke a lot about IFRS '17. I'm sure this might be the topic
of one of the preceding presentations here. As Karl mentioned this year, we have kind of
runoff redundancy, combined ratio, underlying combined ratio of 2.1. I did a kind of
representation for that already, I think, three years ago in London, with the discussion Karl
has mentioned, early this year, we felt that we should be addressing that again.
I should do some expectation management and already say the disclaimer, you might not
get all the answers you are waiting for clear-cut. This is how it works. This is -- there is a
reason behind it. But I hope at least you will understand a little bit more clearly where the
Page 24 of 76

FINAL

uncertainties are, which we have to address and where the uncertainties are, which are
the background of the way how we are communicating this Bermudian Triangle of the
redundancy movements, combined ratios, as we have presented them as well as the
runoff results, as we have to present them as part of our publications.
I did succeed or I should -- I did survive the presentation of the Germany equalization
reserve two years ago. So I hope I will make that far technical -- a little technical
presentation here as well. Moreover. And also Karl has mentioned that I will give you the
usual update on reinvestment yields. And we always try to enrich that with some
additional information, which might be useful for you as well. Also here we get a little bit
technical. So I hope I will guide you through these presentations with enough clarification
to really gain what we have intended to gain from that.

Bloomberg Transcript

How to read the runoff result, I think, these were the 3 -- the Bermudian Triangle, as I
mentioned it already, it is a combined ratio as we've published it. It was 94% for the year
2016. We had reserve redundancies and now I'm stealing a little bit of Andreas' powder. I
hope you apologize for that. But I need -- I need the number. So in this regard, you could
see that the redundancies, I think, at year-end, we had already indicated that we do not
foresee an increase in redundancies as we had seen in the years before. But we see that
the redundancies should at least have been stable.
Now we see a red 0, how we call it here in Germany with a very slight. If we saw -- the
reserve redundancies had been kept stable by year-end 2017. And we were -- we will
come to that forced or we were explaining in our accident year tables in the P&L -- sorry in
the annual report that the runoff result was EUR 800 million, suggesting that the
underlying combined ratio was not as good. We, by the year-end, commented that with
large losses being below -- large loss budget last year, we had been in the position to
also be conservative in the running year and that we felt that there were no really major
runoff results and the combined ratio as presented, did reflect the business of the year
plus the usual positive runoff, which we have. We should bear in mind already here that in
the year before if you compare the two years or 2016 and 2015, in the year before, you
might remember that we have added to redundant reserves EUR 350 million. So in that
regard, the 2005 combined ratio might have intrinsically be -- have been better. But we
would still try to present the 84% combined ratio as a rather normal combined ratio
without any very extraordinary effect.
Let us -- some groundwork, not very breathtaking. But -- and it is, of course, not good if I
stand here and disqualify my own numbers. But we have to bear in mind, what we have to
present as part of our accident year tables in the annual report is derived from actuarial
numbers. So we have an actuarial view. And then we translate that actuarial view into our
accident year tables. And there is some transitional work in between, which can lead to
volatility. So let's go through that quickly. The actuarial view is an ultimate view. We define
the ultimate loss ratio per underwriting year. And that really then defines what has
happened to this underwriting year within a financial year or an accident year. And the
balance sheet view is really, you look at the runoff in the reporting period. And again, I
think these numbers are combined and the balance sheet numbers are derived from the
ultimate -- or from the actuarial numbers. But there is some transitional work in between.
First of all, it is -- the one is net and the one is gross. So you also have to bear in mind that
Page 25 of 76



Company N ame: H annover Rueck SE
Company Ticker: H N R1 GR Equity
Date: 2017-10-19

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

IBNRs have to be allocated to retro sessions and accident years. We also see that here for
the year. And the balance sheet view is based on an accident year basis. The actuarial
view is derived from an underwriting year basis.
On view -- I think the most important thing is here also the last goal, the runoff result is
really a change of the ultimate illustration from an actuarial point of view and then we have
to translate it into the accident years. So I think this is just to be borne in mind. Rather
trivial, still worth mentioning, I would say how is the runoff result determined. We have the
opening balance claims reserves. We have the closing balance of the claims reserves for
the previous years. And that is important. And of course, we have claims paid in between.
And what results is the runoff result. Not very breathtaking, not very exciting. Still, please
bear in mind, this does not affect the current year. So 2016, what has happened to 2016
has not -- or is not affected whatsoever.
On the right-hand side, you see that how we present the runoff result as part of our
annual report. And I think we see that now a little bit easier because you won't be able to
see the numbers anyway on the right-hand side. It's a little bit -- a better reflector. So the
EUR 804 million, as you can see them on the screen, this is what we had published as the
accident year runoff result in 2016. You see rather volatile numbers from accident year to
accident year. And it is important to see that, for instance, 2015 is even negative. So why is
it that the 2015 accident year is even negative? You should bear in mind, we do the math
on an underwriting year basis. The underwriting year 2015 still produces lots of premium in
2016. If you look at your running book, the premium which you get paid on a rather
conservative basis and you establish IBNRs on that business conservatively, which we did
for the premium we have to show in 2016, that means that then the IBNR, which you
established, needs to be allocated also to the accident years. And it has then to be
calculated on a net basis. It has -- it would then include remarkable increase in our financial
reinsurance business. We also -- there you have movement between accident years. So
what I am trying to say here is that the allocation of IBNRs to accident years may have -may see remarkable movements. The on average number is a good guidance of what
has happened. But you see volatile numbers between accident years based on the way
you derive those numbers and how we do that, I think, Andreas will also have that in his
presentation, how the actuaries come to these numbers. The EUR 804 million still. And
this does not at all include any additional conservative view of the year 2016.
We will come to some numbers, I would say, here. If you just -- this then gives you the
view, how did all of our underwriting years develop over the accident years or the financial
years, which we've seen. We've also -- we do show 2 special years but the message,
which we have here is true for each and every year. So we start with an ultimate loss ratio.
If we, for instance, take the year 2010. So we have started with a combined ratio or the
ultimate loss ratio of 81%. It -- also this here has increased one year later to 84% through
the same effect which we have seen with 2015 on the previous page. Then it moves
downwards. You also see that this is again true for all the years. If you go to 2006, we've
started with 63% ultimate loss ratio. Then this ultimate loss ratio goes down until now in
2016, we have reached 54.6%. So there is a clear trend and that is true for each and every
underwriting year, that we start conservatively and then it goes down. Still what I was also
trying to say, the volatility in between these numbers is still remarkable. It's not a clear
trend downwards. So the actuaries look at the numbers on a yearly basis. And also, the

Page 26 of 76

Date: 2017-10-19

FINAL

redundancies within these numbers are migrating. That is one other aspect we will see on
the next page. So the message here is, there is a clear proof that on an underwriting year
basis, we start with conservative high combined ratios and then they trend downwards to
higher numbers. And you also see that, for instance, for the year 2015, there is only one
number. It has decreased slightly. So the newer years do not contribute as much to that
trend as the older years.
That is the message I'm trying to show here. And I was of the opinion that the numbers
could be seen better. Because I think that is really one important message. So you may
look at your -- at the handouts, which we have been giving you, here on the left-hand side.
The left-hand side displays the percentage of contribution of a single underwriting year to
the loss reserve redundancies in a given -- or at the end of a given financial year. So -- and
it's quite obvious that the loss reserve redundancies migrate downwards. So for instance,
if you read it from left to right, let's again take the underwriting year 2010. In the year
2010, it has contributed to the loss reserve redundancies 3%, the next year 12%, then 14%.
And it's still contributing remarkably.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let's take another year, 2006, again. In 2009, which we see, it has still contributed 17%.
But then it goes down. So you see the diagonal. So the redundant loss reserves are
migrating downwards with -- from year-to-year. Quite clear they don't because after quite
some time, you have enough claims being paid, the uncertainty goes down. And this is
why it's no longer justified to have the loss reserve redundancies. That is one point.
So there are 2 ways how this migration works. First of all, you just keep your books' loss
reserves where they were, although you have the chance to bring them down. This would
increase the redundancy contributed by that one underwriting year. The other way would
be to really increase the book reserves from one year to the other. And we see both
ways happening. So on the one hand, we just keep our -- in those years, we start with a
book reserve. In that regard, the uncertainty is still too high for our internal actuaries as
well as for Towers Watson. They don't exactly know how much that year will be
contributing. Then with the additional certainty, the contribution to loss -- to redundant
reserves increases. And with the certainty of the year, it decreases again. So you see this
migration. This is why the loss reserve redundancy contribution migrates down from the
upper left-hand side to the lower right-hand side of that table.
One other important factor here is that if you look at the new years, they contribute to a
very low extent, I mentioned that already, because we don't exactly know how much
redundancy is in such reserves. It is just not taken into account. The result of that is that
our actual redundant reserves should be higher. If you believe that the year 2015 on that
table, which starts with 3% and then 5%, will 3 or -- 2 or three years down the road, also
contribute 16% or 12%, 13% or 14%, then the consequence would be that our loss reserve
redundancies are actually higher. We will only see it later on. So the unfortunate thing is, I
have no proof to you that this will be the case. I have the history. And I can tell you that we
have remained our conservative reserving policy. But not our internal actuary. But -- and
also not Towers Watson will tell us that the reserves, which we have set up in 2016, will
exactly migrate into higher loss reserve redundancies three years down the road. Still I
think this is also why we then tell you by the end of the year with the reserving policy,
which we have applied and we haven't changed that, also the year '16 and '15 should

migrate. So if we stop that tomorrow, if we just book the best estimate reserves for the
running year, it would still mean that EUR 1.9 million, which we have published, will emerge,
will kind of be migrated on. But then we would have not added additional loss reserves -loss reserve redundancies. So that is -- that for me is important. So this is really the
threshold. It should be more. So if we keep our reserving policy as it was, then also the
years 2014, '15 and '16 will contribute to loss reserve redundancies in the future.
So we've just then on the right-hand side here added the development of booked
ultimate loss reserves for underwriting years since 2009. So we look at the underwriting
years since 2009 and what happened to these underwriting years, how have they
developed. And you see here also that there is an additional graph to show what we've
seen on the page before already. You see that there is a clear direction, not a single
underwriting year moves into a different direction. But it is rather volatile. And it changes
from year-to-year. Then I think the runoff profit per the financial year, this is as a
percentage on the page down below.
I think this was also one example. And those who were at the presentation, I think, 3 or
four years ago will remember that you have to bear in mind how do the actuarial best
estimate reserves develop and how do the book reserves develop. Here we have shown
one example, where we have the same deduction in actuarial best estimate reserves and
book reserves. That means, we have a positive runoff and those loss reserve
redundancies stay the same. So if we, for instance, have a improvement of the actuarial
reserve and we stick with the book reserves, then you have no runoff result at all. But you
have an increase in loss reserve redundancies. I think these are the mechanisms, which I
had already explained, I think, three years ago. I just want to remind you that you have
these effects in our book.
So the message which I would -- to summarize that, the actuarial -- or the accident table
shows volatile result and is not always consistent with the actuarial computation based on
underwriting results. The redundant reserves in newer years should even be higher than
what we have published. But I have no proof for that because the actuaries will only dare
to give us their opinion after these underwriting years have matured. The EUR 1.9 billion is
the threshold, which we have, plus the information how we present it to you to give you
each and every quarter the combined ratios as they are, an indication of the runoff result
and the indication of the development of the loss reserve redundancies, is -- we still feel
that this is the best information we could give you, even if some of that cannot be proved.
I think that concludes my remarks on that result. And we -- on the reserve developments
and the presentation of combined ratios and runoffs and redundant reserves. And I come
to the investment update. I think you know that the graph we usually show, the
development of the ordinary yield from assets under own management. So we look at
the full portfolio on that page. We came into the year with 2.7%. We've outperformed that
based on the contribution from the private equity portfolios. We have an estimation for
the next year of 2.7%. And we also have an expectation of 2.7% for the year '19 already. So
we are brave enough to already mention that because, of course, it is based on
assumptions, new cash flow reinvestment yields at that time. So there is some uncertainty
with that. But everything equal, it is also 2.7% in 2019. And I will try to explain to you why
that is. We've also added the usual sensitivity. So if we have a movement in current yields,
Page 28 of 76

100 basis points upwards across the board or downwards across the board, you see the
sensitivity. If we have it moving upwards, the ordinary income would increase to 3.0%. If
we have it downwards, then it would be 2.6%. Looks a little bit irregular. So it's -sensitivities has more space upwards than downwards. But I ask the question when I saw
the numbers is really the numbers behind the points. So it's 2.69% or so. So this is
rounded upwards. And the other numbers are rounded downwards. This is why you have
this unequal distribution. So this is what we predict. This is what our scenarios gave us. And
here is some information as to why that is the case.
Now we're changing to only fixed income. This is where the ordinary income comes from - to a large extent. And we'll look at the portfolio as it is and as we see it in the future per
currency. So it's 30% euro, it is 47% U.S. dollar. And you see the other numbers as they are
displayed. It is also important. And please bear that in mind, that we have shown here the
government portion per currency and the government portion for the U.S. dollar. As you
can see, the bright green part of the column is larger than, for instance, in the euros.
We've tried to avoid negative interest rate. We've tried to move a little bit away from the
very, very low-yielding assets. The U.S. dollar is quite the other way around. Here we have
more govies and, of course, not that amount of covered bonds. So I think that is -- you
should bear that in mind.
If we look then at the next pages. So 3 key figures to evaluate the fixed income return is
the headline for that graph. We have what we call the portfolio yield of our fixed-income
book that is what is here called the locked-in portfolio, 2.53%. This was what is locked in
into the portfolio. We have 2 additional numbers here displayed, one of which is the
current portfolio value. That is the reinvestment yield as we have referred to in the
previous sessions. That assumes we sell the whole portfolio today and reinvest it also
today, what would be the ordinary yield of that portfolio. Then there is another number,
which is the 2.0%. This is the actual reinvestment yield. Now it gets a bit technical. So
please imagine, I have in my books, a well-paid 5-year German government bond from
the good old years. I need to go back further, I agree. But let's assume it's a 5-year bond,
which has a remaining maturity of one year. So in my scenario, I would sell that bond and I
would reinvest in a 1-year maturity government bond, again. This is not what I'm really
doing. I would, of course, buy because the modified duration is rolling forward, I would
buy another 5-year bond. And that defines the difference between the 1.95% and the 2%
because I'm reinvesting actually in longer maturities as in that scenario that I sell
everything and reinvest it today. This is -- this makes up the 5 basis points. We have not
considered any changes in allocation. With the barbell strategy, our strategy was to keep
the risk as it was. So we did not include in that scenario, for instance, that the actual
locked-in portfolio includes a lot of German covered bonds. We're not investing in those
anymore because somebody else buys them all. And they are no longer that attractive. So
we've not included that in the scenario, just the maturity effect. So how can it be that we
are at 2.7%, we reinvest at a lower yield than the locked-in yield? How can it be then that
we remain at 2.7% for the overall portfolio? There is one other aspect you need to be
aware here. And that is where is the big difference between the locked-in yield and the
actual reinvestment yield? That is the euro.
Please compare the bright green and the bright blue line. This is where we lose more
than 100 basis points from the reinvestment. That is also true for the sterling. We also

Page 29 of 76

FINAL

lose a lot between the current yield and the reinvestment yield. It's interesting enough in
the U.S. dollar, we already invest at higher rates as compared to the maturing rate. And
again, please bear that in mind because we need that information to then interpret the
following slides.
Here you see now, I think this is really -- here you see the maturities, the expected
maturities of the fixed-income portfolio up until 2023. And you see it per currency. And
this is not proportional. So you see that in 2017 and in 2018 and also in 2019, we have lots
of maturities in the U.S. dollar, where we reinvest in higher rates. And we have the
modified durations on the right-hand side. And those tell you per currency, that the euro
with six years -- or 6 point because modified duration, as far as I learned, has no
dimension. And the U.S. dollar is -- the currency was the shortest, obviously -- one of the
shorter modified duration. So the turnover in the U.S. dollar is higher. And if we look at the
years here, which we see, we have the maturing U.S. dollars in the next years. We -- well
everything equal, you'll invest them with higher rates. And this is why we have this
resulting here. You see that in 2018, the maturing yield is around 2%. We reinvest with the
high proportion of the dollar at nearly 2.5%. And this is why we can maintain the
profitability of the book.

Bloomberg Transcript

Same is -- still works in 2019. We see it changing a little bit in 2020. So you could argue as
from these years onwards, everything equal, no changes in investment yields. The
dilution, which we have seen over the last years, might start again. But this then is the
explanation as to why we are quite confident that we will achieve the forecasted
numbers, which we've seen before.
There's one more slide here that, now we are leaving the fixed-income space again. And
that shows you that the contribution from private equity as well as from our real estate
increasing portions are increasing. This is why then -- what makes a difference between
the 2.5% as a reinvestment yield for the fixed income and the portfolio yield of 2.7%,
which we predicted for the next years to come. Longer term, of course, this really
depends on the development of the yields in, of course, our currencies. What can be
seen here also that the changes. And you might remember that we had changed our
reporting currencies of our Bermudian and our subsidiaries to the dollar that this, if we
look at the numbers as they emerge here, was not a bad move with regards to this
portfolio.
I think I've 5 minutes left for questions, is that good.

Well we start.

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

I think we should start with the Q&A.
+++qanda

A - Karl Steinle

{BIO 1986424 <GO>}

So the first one I see here with Ivan. And then we continue with Vinit.

Q - Ivan Bokhmat

{BIO 15378004 <GO>}

It's Ivan Bokhmat from Barclays. So I have a question on the reserve redundancies. You
mentioned that for the recent years, it's not completely captured. And if I look at the Slide
7, it shows the average positive development of booked ULRs of 6.5% for the past 10
years. Is there any reason to think that for the recent years, it would be any different,
bigger or smaller?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

No. There is no reason. I think there is -- we've kept our reserving policies as they were.
We have not added to loss reserve redundancies in the year 2016. Well I've no idea what
happened by year-end. But the scenario indicates that there is not a lot of desire or
potential to increase the loss reserve redundancies by year-end 2017. But as the number
is as high as it was. And it had been increasing -- of course, percentage-wise, it always
also depends on the volume of the portfolio as such. But there is no indication why that
should not be the case in the future as well.

Q - Ivan Bokhmat

{BIO 15378004 <GO>}

And the second question also on the reserving. I mean, seeing the large losses for Third
Quarter may exceed your cap budget, would you be willing to use any of -- some of the
redundancy to pad up the results? I'm sure you were expecting that question.

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

Well we will have to make up our mind by year-end when we really know more. If you, for
instance, look at the Ogden reserve situation in the first half year, this is a long-tailed line
of business. This is where we had IBNRs. And such unforeseen circumstances, this is why
you have IBNR. So it was an easy decision to say, well, we don't let that fall-through, this is
why you have your IBNR for. So that was rather easy. Now with a cat event, which has
some potential to change the market to give us opportunities, now to use the valuable
reserves -- and the whole market is affected, we've sent out the profit warning and it was,
Page 31 of 76

as far as I'm concerned, well received. The reaction was everybody understood that. And
we are preparing for a harder market for gross also here now to take the one shot and,
kind of, weaken your balance sheet in such a situation for that one single event, which
everybody knows, which is, I think, that wouldn't make too much sense. Still, we have
always said that these loss reserve redundancies are not quite there to be there all the
time and increase up until eternity. So in this regard, yes, we might lose part of it. But due
to -- well, you said scenario. So if we really come in remarkably below the EUR 1 billion and
then to show another record result and use up all the loss reserve redundancies wouldn't
make sense at all.

A - Karl Steinle

{BIO 1986424 <GO>}

Okay, Vinit, (snacks) and then we continue with Andrew.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes, 2 questions for me, sorry. Just on the Slide four and Slide six of your pack, the 2015,
is it a correct understanding that the actuarial ULR improved by 2 points. But the book to
ULR was significantly worsened by management decision. And is that what you are trying
to say or -- because the 4 and 6 are not consistent in the direction of travel, unless
management action is taken and that was purpose of this slide.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

Vinit, please bear in mind, we -- what we see at -- on Page 4, we look at accident years as
presented in the -- in our Annual Report, based on that format. I must admit I don't like it
for quite some time. But this is the standard to show it. And on the -- and on Page #6, we
show underwriting years. And as I mentioned, to translate from one to the other may have
impact. So it is -- this is why I mentioned the difference in calculation.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

So it's not deliberate, it just happened.

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

And the second question is, you spent a lot of time showing how running yield should
stabilize. How -- the ordinary investment yield 2.7% stabilizes for three years now -- or 2 or
three years. But equally target metrics took 6.5%, goes down to 5% blaming interest
rates. Is that not -- is that fed into the target metrics? And is that consistent? How should
we understand that?

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

I think -- as Ulrich mentioned, I think we try to make it consistent. The 2.7%. And I showed
the numbers, was already a migration downwards. So I think it takes into consideration
that this is bottoming out already. And again, this is a long term -- a longer-term view. If I
Page 32 of 76



FINAL

Company Ticker: H N R1 GR Equity

even make it longer than the average, for my point of view, it doesn't make sense. I have
cash flow assumption, I've reinvestment assumption for additional cash flows, then this is
no longer a plan. But just a scenario. But of course, if everything stays equal, we will have
to assume that a dilution from 2.7% downwards would be starting again. So now
everybody suggests that also Mr. Draghi might change his point of view. And we get
mixed messages from the Fed in the U.S. So I don't have my crystal ball with me for such a
long time. This is why we also then stopped it. But the short answer to your question
would be, yes, it is reflected in our target metrics.

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

Well if I may add, I mean, if the return remains stable. So the absolute investment income
can then only increase by increased volumes or, of course, change in the extraordinary
investment and disregarding that, it can only be increased volumes. And we expect that
the volumes due to the positive cash flow increase by around 5% a year, which is around
EUR 2 billion positive operating cash flow.

A - Karl Steinle

{BIO 1986424 <GO>}

Okay. We continue with Andrew and then followed by Frank Kopfinger.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Could I just, you mentioned Ogden, just return to that exciting subject. Obviously, you
absorbed, I think the number was EUR 261 million or something like that in the first half,
EUR 291 million. Obviously, we've had a potential change of legislation. Also the major
insurers, the primary major insurers in the U.K. are saying that claims are settling actually
above 0 discount rate. So they are anticipating releasing some of their reserve even
without change in legislation. How do you view -- I mean, do you -- would you just
reabsorb that back into your, kind of, IBNR? Or would you then say, well, actually we held it
because we thought there was a change in, now there isn't a change in...

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

No. The assumption would be that this money will go where it came from. So as I
mentioned, we took the IBNR, accept it a decrease in loss reserve redundancy by yearend, potentially. Now if the money comes back -- so in our -- I shouldn't comment on our
Q3 results because they are just being prepared. But up to now, up to today, the
assumption had been that as long as we don't have a clear decision, we cannot change.
And we will present the numbers according to the EUR 291 million, which we have been
showing, although we know that this will most likely come down. But it will as the burden
didn't hit the bottom line. So will the release not hit the bottom line.

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

So it would be more reflected in when we get to this time next year. And you give us the
new reserve redundancy number, it may not have gone down essentially. That's how we
should think?

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}
Page 33 of 76



Company N ame: H annover Rueck SE
Company Ticker: H N R1 GR Equity
Date: 2017-10-19

Or at least about the number we took it down at that point in time. This would have
added then again to reserve redundancies, right?

FINAL

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay. I have one follow-up question actually from the previous presentation. But I think it's
probably, Uli or yourself, would have a view on it. The -- am I right in thinking the life
business from a Solvency II perspective already reflects the current state of the U.S. So
there's no -- you can have IFRS hits. But very modest Solvency II hits. Is that how you think
about it?

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

Yes. That is. There was a movement in -- already in Q2, which we now have published our
view. Always have to bear in mind that we are a quarter behind there. But it is fully
reflected, yes.

Q - Frank Kopfinger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I've -- I want to come back to your Bermudian Triangle on the runoff and the combined
ratio and the redundancies. I would have argued that the better combined ratio of 94%
was driven by lower major losses in 2016. Then, on the other side, we have this 10%
impact on the combined ratio on the -- from the runoff result. And the question is, are you
suggesting -- also, you showed different figures. But are you suggesting that upfront,
you're putting in 9% to 10% in your reserving in combined ratio terms?

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

I was -- and again, I think that was -- this is why I had the disclaimer at the beginning
because I cannot prove to you how much did I add into the year 2016. You just can -- and
by the end of the year, we had a positive large loss result. And we use that also to set up
reserves again conservatively. This is what I was suggesting. So that the EUR 800 million,
10%, well, you would in any case have to deduct the regular normal runoff result, which we
have already shown if you compare that to previous years. And there was also a 2%, 3%
positive runoff result included in that as well. So we're now hoping for (the Top 10) but
potentially 7% according to your math. But what I'm trying to say here is that the run-off as
it's shown on the accident year basis, is not always reliable, especially when it comes to
the allocation of IBNRs in the new years. So we have added. And what we were telling you
is that we have added in the current years, additionally, set up loss reserves so
conservatively that we felt that the 94% reflects it. The one thing, if you compare it to the
previous year, we did not at EUR 350 million do redundant reserves. So it was the
previous year's run-off. If I do the math this way, it could have been EUR 300 million
better. This is what we were suggesting.

Q - Frank Kopfinger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

Then my second question would be on your other favorite topic, equalization reserve. If
we have now a severity year in 2017, what is the impact then on the equalization reserve
and the rev up going forward? And this is also on the local GAAP P&L.

Page 34 of 76

FINAL

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

Well we haven't run it's -- sure, I think, we will have an update on the equalization reserve.
And it was interesting to see that the potential relief by year-end will be lower than
anticipated. This is from my point of view good news. This is why JÃ¼rgen wrote so much
Advanced Solution business, which pumped up the maximum amounts again, especially in
those lines where an equalization reserve is to be set up. And he did. That was good
combined ratios and loss ratios. So we have -- we see the release in the fire and industrial
business as I have explained. But we see additions in other lines because we have been
growing so much, which I appreciate. This is not to say that we have a problem with the
relief, which we see on the equalization reserve, is to be expected lower than we had
anticipated. How do now the losses or the effect to equalization reserve? Funny enough,
we don't have anything in store. This is why you don't have an equalization reserve. And I
would assume that a lot of these losses are storm losses, there are others as well. So I
wouldn't see that much of an impact on the numbers which we see. But this is really
speculation. Now I haven't run it through. This is why I explained the 12 steps to have them
two years ago. It is really complicated. And we have do it line by line. And we haven't done
it yet.

A - Karl Steinle

{BIO 1986424 <GO>}

Okay. Any further other questions? Okay. From Daniel and...

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Daniel Bischof

{BIO 17407166 <GO>}

Yes. (inaudible), Baader-Helvea. Just one question on the investment side. So last year at
this time, you explained that you're going to increase the equity and real estate exposure.
But also the CLO and leveraged loan portion and loan investment grade part. Could you
provide an update on these 2 new sector? Were there any adjustments to that or they're
not changed?

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

I think we have invested up to the defined budget. So this really worked well exactly how
we had planned and it was a step-by-step increase. Of course, the performance of these
asset classes had been very, very positive. Some spreads have narrowed. That is true for
the U.S. dollar as well as the euro. So you really have to think about which classes you still
reinvest into right now based on these numbers. Still, with -- especially with the CLOs, it's
interesting and well you might know or not that in these asset class, our -- the managers
are in a position to refinance every second year, with the specs having narrowed that
much, everybody will do that. And of course, then refinance at lower rate. As to whether
these lower rates are then really still effective, we would have to see. And we will see
some of these maturities, I think, especially next year. So there is a little bit of question
mark as to whether all the rating classes of these 6 CLO buckets will still be attractive,
especially when they are refinanced over the next two years. Right now -- up to now, they
have been performing, I shouldn't say spectacular. But very well.

A - Karl Steinle

{BIO 1986424 <GO>}

Okay. Another question from Vinit.

Sir, apologies for following up. In 2011, the equalization reserve was actually added into,
from my memory. And you just alluded that it could probably happen again this year. But
just to link it to Uli's comment that the specialty, we would be paid only if the net income
supported the total. Shouldn't you have linked it to the German GAAP and the revenue
reserve? Or you could just update us on where that is likely to be? Or what do you think
about all that?

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

Again, I think I indicated at the time when we were asked, does the German GAAP
number limit your ability to pay dividends? This is when we said, shortly after that we had
added to retain earnings, it's EUR 0.5 billion now, I would have to look at that. We have
also a profit carried forward. And also this now amounts to around EUR 400 million. So
there is a lot of potential. And if need be, I also indicated that. And I indicated that the
addition or the lower amount, which are now going to be released based on JÃ¼rgen's
success on the Advanced Solution markets. Well if need be, if we proceed that within the
group outside Germany, that burden would be gone away. So in that respect, I would
reiterate the German GAAP numbers do not limit our ability to pay special dividends.

Solvency position, actually up to Q2, give a little bit on the movement analysis. And
continue with some aspects on the risk position, stress test results, also from NatCat.
Then expand a little bit on what Uli started to explain or explained this morning, NatCat
events here with a focus of early, say, model validation and how it plays with -- together
with our risk appetite that we have communicated for this NatCat events. And finally, I'll
explain some additionally aspects on the development of the P&C claim reserves, which
have not been mentioned by Roland in his talks. So get a little bit more into detail there.
You know that we measure our capital position at the 2 confidence levels 99.5% to
compare it with the Solvency II, which is only a few steps away from Solvency II and 99.97%
to also capture very extreme events and dependencies. We still maintain sufficient buffer
over our internal targets of thresholds of 200%, respectively 99.5% confidence level and
110% of the 99.7% confidence level. So that is basically similar to year-end.

Bloomberg Transcript

If we look at Solvency II figures comparison, we have actually 2 steps. The one is the
haircut for minority interest, it was in the Solvency II and it brings down our available capital
by about EUR 700 million for the Hannover Re Group. Then the other element is the
Solvency II standard formula. You know that we measure on an internal model basis
internally. But for Solvency II, we use a partial internal model and use the standard formula
for operational risk. And so our current Solvency II ratio is 231% at Q2. And we've got this
the third column Notional Solvency II because we have just got the approval for the
operational risk model. And by year-end, we will be reporting on a full internal model. And
that brings 15 to 20percentage points depending on the due date (inaudible).
So of course, we are quite happy that we could conclude this major project of getting
approvals for the operational risk model, which started actually in 2016. So it was really a
large internal project involving many experts from our Hannover Re internal expert
network across the globe from all operating entities that we have many operating
entities, because some elements, of course of operational risk assessment are going to
be assessed on a local basis based on the knowledge of the local processes and actually
what can go wrong on a local basis there. So we involved many people. We have now a
fully stochastic approach in place for operational risk so that follows the internal model
that was more realistic than we are using before.
And yes, when we look at the results, the undiversified results actually are not so different
between internal model and standard formula. So there is a difference from EUR 666
million capital requirements for a 200-year event, a new interest 99.5% to EUR 489
million. That's the internal model. But if you look at the diversified figures with all other risk
categories like underwriting risk, market risk, then there is a substantial difference based
on the 2 standard model. It doesn't have a -- sort of a diversification module for
operational risk.
So even if we, of course, don't assume full independence between operational risk and
other risks. So we have some correlation built in there. There are substantial
diversification. And therefore, the sort of marginal impact of operational risk is only from
internal basis, EUR 129 million.

If we look at the sort of this figure of EUR 489 million undiversified risk capital. So we can
look at individual scenarios. The model is actually build up from quite a significant number
of scenarios, which then are used to calibrate an annual loss probability. And the largest
scenarios that we currently have identified are on our compliance risk, which reflects
certainly increasing regulation in many areas, maybe market conduct. But also data privacy
rules. And on the other hand, insufficient processes, very important processes could go
wrong (that could lead to financial)...
(technical difficulty)
One of the topics that we have already covered today. Cyber risk is also something that
we are dealing with an internal perspective, not only from an underwriting perspective,
taking on cyber risk or looking at our cyber exposures by scenario analysis, also internally
we are protecting ourselves against cyber attacks. But still of course, there is loss
potential here and fraud potential from sort of known and sort of kinds of cyber attacks.
So these 3 things actually identified as the largest scenarios. And here we have the 200year loss potential for the Hannover Re Group that we have identified on that basis.

Bloomberg Transcript

If you look at the development of the Solvency ratio starting at the end of 2015. So this is
known to you part of the annual reporting, the transition from 2015 to 2016. It has a -- we
had a slight increase of about 10percentage points in 2016 mainly due to the positive
results and favorable business development in that year which are in line with our IFRS
results. In 2017, we had a stable ratio and several affects sort of moving up and moving
down. The overall figures go down a little bit due to the fix development, the weakening
of the U.S. dollar since year-end 2017 -- 2016 is the main effect here.
So as of Q2 2017, we have sort of 91% of Tier 1 capital on the Solvency II and 9% of Tier 2
capital and we have actually another about 30percentage points of Solvency ratio that
could begin by unused Tier 2 and Tier 3 capital. So elements that we don't use at the
moment. But which are eligible for covering capital requirements under Solvency II.
If you look at the sort of Solvency II ratio movement in 2017, then we have split that out
here into 4 components. The economic variances, I guess, we're...
(technical difficulty)
Smaller impacts from interest rate and FX movements here. They are largely hedged, the
largest part of this comes from spreads -- decreasing spreads on our investment
portfolio. Then we have done some model changes and here they lead to decrease in
the case of the overall Solvency ratio, which is sort of a typical thing that one can observe
on the Solvency II that if you sort of strengthen your model on underwriting risk side, you
have also hit on your eligible own funds due to the risk margin, due to the increased loan
debt of that. So -- and that's what happened this year, although we didn't make any major
changes since the inception of Solvency II. And all of these changes that we hear are
individual changes are below 2% SCR impact. The overall impact was also a little bit -- a
little bit larger.

Capital management is just a column that shows the buildup for dividend payments or for
the dividends, which are deducted from available capital on a Solvency II basis. So that's
the buildup in the first half of 2017. And the rest is, of course, in a sense most interesting
operating experience. That's the business developer affecting the business development.
And the new business value that we have taken up. But also experience variances from
opt-in rates that we touched on earlier and also from U.S. mortality that are -- sort of want
to run reflected in the Solvency II figures. But potentially not reflected in IFRS, if they're
sort of in -- for opt-in rates in the redundant reserves and for U.S. mortality subject to
locked-in reserves. So they are shown on a Solvency II basis immediate results. So overall
the Solvency ratio kept stable, although in between and also in 2015 we certainly saw
some ups and downs, 5% to 8% deviations. That's not unlikely from quarter-to-quarter,
also depending on their variances which you book in each quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

If you move on to the risk profile of Hannover Re, I, of course, like to emphasize
diversification here, which is a very important steering element for us. And here, again,
this slide, what are the largest sort of contributors to overall capital loan on a standalone
basis, we have shaded the different risks here in different colors depending on the value
of risk. The SCR makes up more than 10% of available capital, more than 5% or less than
5%. But it also gives some indication how those risk categories are also treated in internal
steering processes, how much attention we give to these individual categories. And also it
gives an indication of course, that we think that we have substantial diversification
between the largest risks that we have in our book, quite obvious between longevity and
mortality. But also longevity and NatCat. Also, those things are thought to be largely
independent, which emphasizes what we've said before that we can write more business
on the same amount of capital, of course, we have more diversification in our book.
On this slide, if we look at this level of between Property & Casualty and Life & Health
market, we have market risk, the largest risk in our book and Property & Casualty is
second largest, a quite substantial diversification here. Here we have shown everything on
an internal model basis. So that's operational risk from an internal model basis and also
available capital from an internal model basis. And these are already standalone figures.
You see the tax impact that we deduct and the diversification. And if you use a capital
allocation approach and look at what the contribution of each of the individual risks is to
overall after-tax, post-tax we applied capital, then it's about 50-50 between market risk
and underwriting risk. So market risk absorbs quite a substantial capital.
So diversification is important at all levels. Here I'm going through all details. But you see
also diversification between old and new business in P&C. And as said before, between
longevity and mortality in Life & Health, although we certainly don't assume negative -strong negative correlation here, because we typically insure different parts of the
population in different countries and it also shows that those 2 figures, EUR 1.582 billion
and EUR 1.393 billion for longevity, they don't equal out but represent a substantial part of
the overall underwriting risk for Life & Health.
If we look at few stress tests, a few which are sort of also relevant in the current context,
with the recent natural catastrophes and if you compare that to the overall available
capital, you see that even if you look at this at a sort of point in time manner and neglect
for a moment. So earnings that would also emerge over 1-year time horizon. So stress

test has typically evolved in point in time, thing you expected. Everything happens
immediately. And sort of 1 second later, you set up in your balance sheet. So this is just a
comparison of the magnitudes that large risks could -- of the impacts that large risk could
have, too, on our balance sheet. And U.S. Caribbean hurricane is certainly one of the
largest risks, every 100-year event, EUR 850 million. So let's say, over the past couple of
years, or if you compare it -- if you can just compare it to the first with the overall NatCat
budget that we have, it's a bit comparing with available capital of use -- a post-tax
number, this is small pretax figure. So you would do a reconciliation to translate one into
the other. But that's the overall annual aggregate NatCat budget that we have. Our
current limit is about EUR 1.85 billion...
(technical difficulty)

Bloomberg Transcript

14% of our available capital that we believe sort of a relation that we communicate for the
business. So before diversification, of course, a relation that we communicate to compare
our NatCat exposure changes in relation to available capital over time. And I think in 2009,
we were over 20%. So that has decreased over time. And it's actually, at the moment, at a
minimum, I would say, we're in a sort of time period where we're really considering -consider that on that basis. And the current utilization is about 75% here of the overall
limit.
I want to say that some of the largest contribution to this overall NatCat exposure, annual
aggregate is U.S. hurricane. So that's by far the largest individual sort of scenario if you can
call U.S. hurricane, which is, of course, U.S. is big. And U.S. Caribbean hurricane, one
individual scenario. And yes, we will see that on the next slide, that is actually another one,
individual. But of course, we can combine that into one figure if we do consider all
scenarios, which are possible in NatCat.
If we look at sort of model relative to reality, let's say then this graph shows the large loss
budget of the last 11 years and the model standard deviation for the NatCat large loss
budget, I should say, the model standard deviation and the arrows, the gray arrows show
the actual value. So what will you expect? I mean do you would probably expect that there
are not so many years where it's far outside of one standard deviation, although, of
course, NatCat is a volatile business. So it's more volatile than other types of business. But
keep in mind that this is sort of global NatCat. So there is a substantial diversification here,
which brings the volatility even of NatCat a little bit down. So we have seen in most years
that it's moving along standard deviation. I'm glad to say that we would expect that for
2017 also, although, of course, we've heard that loss estimates is very early to really
announce a real figure. And we don't do that today. But from that perspective, we would
say that probably model performance hasn't -- there is no indication at least from this
graph that the models didn't perform or that we had sort of losses not well covered in the
models.
If you then look sort of zoom in a little bit and look into the recent natural catastrophes. So
as for loss estimates, the ranges are large. Also for a model validation, it's very early. But
we have started to look at that. And here we have -- we show the AIR loss, communicated
or published loss estimates, which were market loss and then the model return period for
these market loss estimates in our, sort of, models.

So what do we see? We see, of course, the Hurricane Maria looks like an extraordinary
event here in that table. But I guess, most of us probably see that range of AIR model
top-end of what it can really play out at the end. Anyway, we see that some really had
some interesting -- some characteristics, which it will play out as sort of anticipated by AIR.
It wouldn't be unreasonable to assume that it wasn't, say, 75 to 200-year or 350-year
event. All the other events that we have on that table are well covered in the models
between 10 to 20 years. So there is also from this comparison no indication that there is a
lot missing in the model. At least if you look at sort of loss amounts, of course, we have a
lot of learnings, if you look at the emerging of the -- emergence of the loss estimates
from these 3 hurricanes because all are very specific. And I would say, none of those
hurricanes we have, sort of, past example, which is very nice and similar to those.

Bloomberg Transcript

And we have compiled a few of the event characteristics for you. Actually, Hurricane
Harvey, a hurricane which had sort of large high wind speed in areas with low population
and heavy rain areas with significant population. And of course, that means that the wind
losses are not as big from Harvey or the -- actually the flood losses are larger than the
wind losses here. And especially, for flood losses we have still some under insurance even
in the U.S.. So only a portion of the economic loss for floods actually insured. So -- and of
course, there is also sort of -- it's even harder to estimate flood to flood losses in such a
short period after the event than actually the storm losses, where there's more
experience in estimating those losses.
If you look at Irma, this is more sort of a typical hurricane, say, which has a path in the
Caribbean and then hits Miami. It had sort of the potential to become a real big event, of
course. But sort of, in contrast to sort of predictions, the hurricane finally in made landfall
in Cuba and slowed down there a little bit. Then it was in Florida only a Cat 4 event and/or
a Cat 3 event then later on. And given the good sort of building construction types in
Florida, which are, of course, prepared for strong winds, this then created another a huge
loss, a high loss. Of course, it was a severe hurricane. But let's say, this storm, 50
kilometers to the east would have been really a severe event, probably beating then
Katrina in loss amount.
Very specific event, again, it's Maria, which in a sense is a typical hurricane, which is
indicating, when I say typical, I mean, that's in the catalogs of the modeling firms of the
models, of the standard models that are used for assessing the prices or for exposure
management for such hurricanes. But here it's specific because it -- at its -- it hit Puerto
Rico, it is also another Caribbean islands. But Puerto Rico has probably different
infrastructure than typical Caribbean islands, as it is overseas territory of the U.S. with a lot
manufacturing there as well. So -- and therefore, a much higher exposure than other
Caribbean islands. I guess, it was also the reason why I was assuming much higher
damage ratios to those exposures at a very beginning. And of course, we probably have
impacts from demand surge here, because all the supply for rebuilding everything that
has been destroyed or a lot of the supply needs to be coming from -- needs to come
from mainland and it's been more expensive there. So from that perspective, the storm
was sort of very extraordinary event for Puerto Rico. But not an event that was sort of
completely out of scope. So it wasn't only that Puerto Rico had larger exposures than
other islands and that Cat 5 storms can hit them, although this was at landfall of Cat 4. Of

course, the categories I should have said determined the wind speed that those storms
have and they made landfall at the moment and it's recorded.
I would say, overall, we have a number of outlooks of midsize events. So this is a more
frequency year for natural catastrophes. The overall loss potential seems to be rather
reflected in the models, although I am sure that there are many specific counties that we
need to build in, in the modeling in the next couple of years, maybe heavy rain and
flooding from Harvey, also checking the frequency assumptions for large Cats in the
Caribbean Sea. But it doesn't look very unusual and needless.

Bloomberg Transcript

You can maybe also ask yourselves about this sort of related to climate change, of
course, there is no evidence. But there is, of course, some probability and I would say the
probability is not low that this is related to climate change and probably good risk
management would require for some actions here. We try to include the learnings from
those events. And also, the elements from climate change into our models in a gradually
basis. It's as we have EUR 10 sort of risk appetite statements renewals, we can do that
from year-to-year and sort of learn from past years' experience. So we think it's still a
multiyear or a longer time horizon where we will actually see how this plays out. But the
type of validation we do on those events will also take into account everything that this is
related to climate change.
Okay. Now I turn to the P&C loss reserves, the property/casualty loss reserves. This is the
numbers we are talking about. We have EUR 24 billion of property/casualty loss reserves
in our book. See, about 50% from U.S. and Germany and increasing share from the rest of
the world. That is growing more dynamically than other parts of the world. We -- from the
EUR 24 million, the -- by far the -- the larger part of that, more than 50%, is originated by
our own methods based on cedent-advised reserves and, of course, on our historical
experience of how such losses will evolve. So that demonstrates the importance of our
sort of internal actuarial analysis here. And yes, 55% of that is IBNR.
If you look at lines of business, typically, there is focus on the larger shares on long-tail
lines, general liability, motor liability and also marine, which have a longer tail. This is
typically because, yes, the other losses are paid out just earlier. So it's naturally that you
have such a book dominated by long-tail lines.
So if you look at reserve redundancy, Roland has already disclosed the figure. We have -thank you for that. So I don't have to do it now. We have almost stable, slightly decreasing
reserve redundancy from year-end 2015 to year-end 2016. If you look in relative terms, it
has actually decreased from 8.7% to 8.2%. The reserve redundancy and sort of I -- so
when we look at the previous years, it was more natural that we would build up reserves.
2016 was the first year that has -- wouldn't happen. And I wouldn't expect that we have
strong improvement in redundancy in 2017, although, of course, this depends on many
things on -- that we have heard today already on the loss estimates for the losses, for the
cat losses and the way we want to use redundancies there and on how often rate plays
out, how this regulation would be put in place and as it is announced and also on few Q4
experience. So that probably -- that this is more sort of a level that we should also expect
for year-end depending on what's going to happen in the rest of the year of the
estimates.

Yes. This is a slide, which explains a little bit the -- which explains the volumes that we're
talking to about. And when we published the loss-reserving triangles, you know that with
Q2, we each year publish 9 loss-reserving triangles for these 9 lines of business. And
those are the underlying volumes that are split by different underwriting years of really old
reserves for some of the long-tail lines of business and the newer underwriting years
2016 through 2005. And the overall triangle resulting from this portion of our reserves the
Hannover Re/E+ S. It means this is without branches and subsidiaries. So everything that is
booked in the Hannover is Hannover. The -- we see -- let's say, you see, of course, not a
lot on a very aggregated triangle. But you see some element of softening markets in
2015, 2016, although it is, of course, overlaid by large loss experience. And so the way we
have more reserve for redundancies may be in more consecutive adjustments for
younger years. And also, of course, 2016 is not fully developed here, as this is the year on
premium in 2016 only. And a portion of the underwriting year premium will be earned in
2017 only.
Yes. This, again, on the table that Roland had already in his slide, I only want to emphasize
that we typically have positive reserve developments. And that is the case for years
where we don't have large losses as in 2006 and also in years where we have large
losses, significant large losses in 2011. So it doesn't really depend on large loss and also
shows me that also in large losses, we have more prudent approach typically at least
overall.
This concludes my presentation. And I'm happy to take your questions.

Okay. Olivia, start with your questions, please.

Q - Olivia Sylvia Brindle

{BIO 17273762 <GO>}

Just a couple of questions trying to understand some of the solvency and disclosures. So
first question, you used to talk quite a lot about the rating agency view and that as being
the sort of binding constraint on the capital. But you've moved very far away from talking
about that. And why is that? Is that still a relevant metric to look at? And maybe what is
that number in terms of the surplus on a rating agency view? Then in terms of the
economic disclosures, I mean, if you look at the second slide that you showed, there's 3
different metrics there, presumably your own view of your surplus is the 265% over the
200%. And that's, I guess, the -- and the way you look at it internally. And if that is correct,
I was wondering if you could reconcile that with your statement that you wouldn't pay out
more dividend than your IFRS earnings. Because it's clearly a very significant economic
buffer if it is 65percentage points?

A - Andreas MÃ¤rkert
Yes. To your first -- sorry, I forgot your first question.

A - Karl Steinle

{BIO 1986424 <GO>}

FINAL

A - Andreas MÃ¤rkert
Oh the rating agencies, I'm sorry. Yes. So we still have a buffer above our target
capitalization in the rating agencies, which was relevant for maintaining our target rating,
say, with S&P. We have recently had seen quite a number of changes in the S&P model.
One positive change to our side is that they recognize now our internal model to a larger
extent in their model. But they've made also some adjustments in other areas. For
longevity risk, they made some adjustments. And I would say, they have confirmed our
rating this year. But in terms of the capitalization, we are in ongoing negotiations with S&P,
how this is going -- all these changes that they've made over the first half of this year, how
it is going to play out and what it really means for our buffer above our target AA level in
their model. So that's ongoing work. At the end of the year, we had a substantial buffer,
above AAA, actually, in their model at the end of 2016, with all the changes they've
infused. We will still need to see how that plays out and how the end of 2017 figures is
looking like. So that's still an important constraint to us. But of course, the main sort of
steering model is the internal model, which also defines the risk budget for the individual
risk categories. So that -- so for that reason, we will probably in the future present more
on internal model in Solvency II metrics and only mention S&P as our constraint.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

I mean, on your second question, as far as the relatively comfortable solvency ratio on the
Solvency II, should that not mean that we should think of returning more capital to
shareholders. The way we see it, that's the -- the model outcome is still quite volatile and
particular, I mean, changes in the spread and market risks can create quite some volatility,
also, for example, changes in the expected mortality -- future mortality. So from that point
of view, directionally, at this point in time, we have no upper limit for the Solvency II capital
adequacy ratio. Directionally, we see it positive set number is higher rather than lower.
And it's not guiding at this point in time our dividend policy.

Q - Olivia Sylvia Brindle

{BIO 17273762 <GO>}

So can I just follow up on the -- so if we look on Slide 2, which is the number that you think
about really? I mean, presumably, you have a view of what your surplus is and the
minimum target ratio for all those 3 columns is 200%. But -- I mean, 230% or 265% versus
200% is quite a different number. So -- which is, I guess, the most indicative of those to
look at?

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

From my point of view -- sorry for interrupting you, it's probably the 252% because that
takes into account the operational risk model that has been approved by our regulator
from year-end. And therefore, this is probably the current most precise regulatory view, I
would say. And -- so we -- so when we think of how comfortable are we capitalized from
Solvency II point of view, this is basically the number. Prior to the approval of the
operational risk model, we would have looked at the 231%.

A - Karl Steinle

{BIO 1986424 <GO>}

Q - Daniel Bischof

{BIO 17407166 <GO>}

I have 2 questions on Slide 5. So the first one, were there any variances in assumptions?
And if so, what was the impact of those? And secondly, if we look at your target metrics,
what would this mean in terms of normalized capital generation Solvency II points?

FINAL

A - Andreas MÃ¤rkert
On first question, the 2 major elements that in terms of variances were certainly the
optimum rate as mentioned, EUR 290 million. And the reserve strengthening in Q2 for U.S.
mortality at the range of EUR 480 million. So that -- I would say, that were the main
variances that we had here. On Solvency II capital generation, we have just seen that this
has been included in the target metrics. And from the target metrics, I guess, that would
be -- the return on Solvency II capital would be the target. But not necessarily the capital
generation. Because, of course, that depends a lot also on FX rate movements and our
interest rate movements.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

So going on Slide 9, please. The EUR 850 million in the slide used to be EUR 659 million
last year. I mean, the euro has probably strengthened. I don't know how you look at the
currency. But that's quite a sizable shift for one year. Is there any comment that you feel
that you should add to why that move happened? Is it just the definition of Caribbean as
well? Or -- so that's the first question. And I can go to the second one, if you want. On the
Slide 15, there is a significant shift in the U.S. gross loss reserves. I mean, this -- between
last year and now, the EUR 2 billion shift in the slide. Of that, roughly EUR 500 million is
U.S. and EUR 700 million is rest of the world. But where are these -- I mean, U.S., I can
understand, maybe it's linked to this whole property cat exposure, also linked to the first
question. But what is rest of the world? Or is it FX?

A - Andreas MÃ¤rkert
Okay. For U.S. hurricane, we have, indeed, increased the exposure over the year also
intentionally. Because this was -- the rates were still sort of more adequate in the U.S. in
some areas than they were in other parts of the world. So there has been an increase. But
also, there is, of course, an FX effect. I'm not able to reconcile it now exactly due to larger
figures which part is FX and which part is exposure. So I would say, those are the 2 main
effects that bring these figures to each other.
On Slide 15, you were referring to the composition of the reserving book...

FINAL

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Has grown. Where is that? And because just if we stay on composition in the next few
slides, 17, you said that general liability is 46% on the title. But it used to be 46%; it is now
42%. So clearly, there's been some kind of shift. So you have lower liability. I'm just trying
to marry all these trends and see where the change is coming from.

A - Andreas MÃ¤rkert
I think the -- to mention just -- I mean, rest of the world is growing as our book sort of
outside U.S. Europe is growing stronger than in the U.S. And Europe -- especially in Asia.
And for the U.S., I guess, the largest contribution there. And also what decreases the U.S.
liability share is probably the larger transactions to Advanced Solutions. (inaudible) also to
JÃ¼rgen's presentation later on just after. So that should be the 2 main, I would say,
aspects here.

A - Karl Steinle

{BIO 1986424 <GO>}

Okay. We have a question on the left-hand side from Andrew. Then we continue with
Thomas and Guilhem.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

I'm sorry to go back to Slide 5. It was inevitable you've got questions on this. The
operating capital generation, did you say the EUR 567 million is after about EUR 800
million of negative variance?

A - Andreas MÃ¤rkert
Yes, EUR 800 million pretax. So that was a post-tax figure. Yes.

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

This is post-tax on the EUR 800 million. Or it's EUR 770 or something like that is the
variance?

A - Andreas MÃ¤rkert
Yes.

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay. So -- I mean, that's a very high underlying -- I guess, there was unusually positive
large loss experience as well in that -- as a positive variance.

A - Andreas MÃ¤rkert
Yes. And there was -- yes, there were large loss experience in the first half of the year,
then a new business value, of course, that comes in.

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Yes. And how much is the new business value?

A - Andreas MÃ¤rkert

FINAL

I only have about EUR 230 million for Life & Health. I don't have the P&C figure with me.

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

No. It's for Life & Health, sorry. It's EUR 230 million within that number. And again, the EUR
230 million is pretax, post-tax? Pretax?

A - Andreas MÃ¤rkert
That's pretax.

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay. Second question, longevity. People seem to be dying more now, again, in the U.K.
You mentioned in the U.S.. But in the U.K., we've actually had a lot of pension schemes
recently change their longevity assumptions. Are you looking at that, how it would affect
you?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Andreas MÃ¤rkert
I mean, we are looking at that certainly, of course, also sort of in line with our
investigations for U.S. mortality. Also this -- there's some learnings that we want to look at
in the U.K. But we haven't changed our assumptions for longevity yet. So I've not
introduced this new information in our reserves setting.

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Would you typically do it this early, because you're not really on risk fully for most of it?

A - Andreas MÃ¤rkert
I think we would be reluctant to do it sort of quite soon, I would say.

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

And the final question. Why would you ever use that NatCat appetite? You're still a long
way below it. Is that just a reflection the prices would have to be a lot higher for you to
even consider getting near there? I don't know if you have ever been there. So I can't be
really sure.

A - Andreas MÃ¤rkert
Yes. I mean, you have to keep in mind the worldwide, -- the sort of usage of the
worldwide NatCat budget. So I guess, the utilization in the U.S. would be much higher
because we think the rates are in some areas still adequate where we -- so that -- but --

Page 47 of 76

or not as bad as in other parts of the world. So -- but there's significant underutilization in
other areas of the world, which sort of brings this number down to only 75%.

A - Karl Steinle

{BIO 1986424 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay.

A - Andreas MÃ¤rkert
Because still the products are the things you need to fulfill our margin requirements, of
course. So they are not using the budget if they don't fulfill margin requirements.

A - Karl Steinle

{BIO 1986424 <GO>}

Okay. The next question comes from Guilhem.

Q - Guilhem Horvath

{BIO 18460437 <GO>}

Yes. Going back down on Slide five under capital management and buildup for
foreseeable dividends. Are you building up for specialty -- I guess, this is 2017 foreseeable
dividend. Are you building that for ordinary only? Or are you...

A - Andreas MÃ¤rkert
We're building up for special dividends as well.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Guilhem Horvath

{BIO 18460437 <GO>}

Okay. And second question is on the NatCat's budget, which is EUR 660 million. Is the
difference with the EUR 825 million going from the man-made budgets? Is the difference...

A - Andreas MÃ¤rkert
Yes. That's right. That's -- the difference is the man made. Yes.

A - Karl Steinle

{BIO 1986424 <GO>}

Okay. Thomas?

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Yes. Just one question on my side regarding the current risk profile of the group. I would
like to get more disclosure from your side on how your retro has been used so far this
year and how much is left until the end of the year? But eventually, if you've got some big
opening in the remaining weeks before the end of the year, that's the type of questions
that we have to (garner) just to better understand how much of the additional losses
could be transferred to the retrocessionaire? So any sensitivity you could provide could be
very helpful.

Yes. Of course, as said, it's very early to -- we have to bottom-up loss estimate. The
ranges are huge. So also, for that reason, we would have arranged for possibilities how
the retro program could be affected until the end of the year. At the moment, we still
have substantial retro capacity in place, lot of the care facilities is still there and also the
whole account facilities larger are still in place. And so we've also sort of checked whether
we can sort of standby for backup covers that clients want to buy and have just (inaudible)
Q4 risk budget is still in line with our risk appetite. And given the substantial rate that have
still in place, we think -- still in place, according to current loss estimates ranges, we think
that we can offer backup covers to our clients.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Follow-up question. So -- just one more. So if we had another big claims coming up,
should we expect your share of the losses to start to be significantly below your usual
market share as a relief of (traditionals)? Or...

A - Andreas MÃ¤rkert
If you calculate the market share on net, I would say, it's more the usual the market share.
But of course, it depends a little bit on the usage of the retro programs of all the other
market participants. So I'm bit reluctant to answer that question.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

I would say if the loss is very large, then our retro program would respond very well. So if
we get a very large loss, we will -- probably, our net loss will be certainly below our market
share of the overall reinsurance market. But it might also be below our market share and
cat business. If the losses are medium-size to smaller, then that's probably not the case.

A - Karl Steinle

{BIO 1986424 <GO>}

Okay. Well thank you, Andreas. Thank you for your questions. We will continue with the
presentation from JÃ¼rgen GrÃ¤ber. He will give us some insights into the property and
casualty reinsurance business. And without further ado, I hand over.

A - JÃ¼rgen GrÃ¤ber
Well thank you very much, Karl. Appreciate this. And it's my pleasure to, again, talk about
growth. I have this kind of destiny and pleasure at the same time to always talk about
growth. In the last years, I spoke about growth in the U.S. in agricultural business, cyber
and China, you will remember these presentations. And this time, I will focus, of course,
on the Advanced Solutions so that you understand more why is this driving our top line
and what does it do to combined ratio to the bottom line and so on. But before I do so, of
course, growth shouldn't be done without profit. So let's talk about how do we measure
profits and how have we done in terms of profits in the past.
And if we look at this one note, it's the old 10 Deutsche Mark note. Not that I'm
recommending we should reintroduce this currency. But this is the famous mathematician,
Mr. Gauss. He invented the formula for the distribution curve. And still today, when we
measure profitability, we allocate capital based on volatilities. And therefore, we need the
Page 49 of 76

Company Ticker: H N R1 GR Equity
Date: 2017-10-19

FINAL

distribution curve calculations, either the bar or the T-bar calculations. And I just wanted to
remind us that this is critically important for us in measuring profit. Our system is called
RORAC, return on risk-adjusted capital. And it follows elements of this mathematical
calculation.
And if I then start to guide you into the guidance we give to you the outside world, you will
know this formula where we guide you with arrows and with pluses and minuses. The
arrows are on the volume. It's up or down. And of course, the profitability is measured by
plus or minus. And I want to highlight in particular here the footnote, which we have
zoomed out a little bit. And you see there, as far as the footnote is concerned, that we
follow a very strict guidance. We call it plus/minus if we expect to earn exactly the costs of
capital and, of course, get reimbursed for admin costs and retro costs. And if we expect
to be above in one of these 10 segments, we would say it's plus or well above a double
plus. Or if it's minus or significantly below, then we would indicate a minus or plus. That is
what we have always done. So our external communication follows the internal
assessment according to the risk-based capital methodology that we are using.

Bloomberg Transcript

But let me now go into a few details about these calculations. And later on, I'll give you
sample figures about how we have calculated. We have input parameter. We had some
discussion about target capital. Of course, we have the requirements on the IFRS capital.
We have the requirements on the economic capital. And we put in, of course, all the
various capital models and the respective requirements. We are dividing the capital into
the 3 large blocks of revenue, if I call it like this: it's P&C; it's Life & Health; and asset
management. And of course, we are connecting this planning with individual plans with
forecasts and, of course, with midterm outlooks.
We then look at what can be achieved risk-free, measured by the 5-year average of the
10-year govies. And of course, we look at what is the market expectation, i.e., what is the
outside expecting from us, i.e., looking at the volatility of our stock, what kind of return
does the investors community want. Then we have the output parameters. We're ending
up with a weighted average cost of capital. And we eventually transfer all this capital
management and margin requirement into a profit margin on every dollar of premium we
write. So when we write a German motor quota share treaty or some life business or a cat
business out of Bermuda, we would need to know what is the margin that we try to
achieve.
So if I use some very well-rounded numbers for a minute and look at the input parameter,
we would just take a figure of, say, EUR 15 billion of target capital, kind of an economic
capital, orientated on the Solvency II capital. And we would then, by Executive Board
decisions, split this into the various segments. So we would allocate 40% to Roland to
define his risk appetite. We would give 25% to Claude and Klaus and the 3 P&C board
members would take 35% of this capital. So if you do the math, 35% of EUR 15 billion. So
we operate a bit more than EUR 5 billion in P&C in terms of capital at risk.
Then if we look at our plan, our premium volume, we are in the vicinity of round about EUR
10 billion gross premium, EUR 9 billion net. And we would then say, what additional internal
costs do we have? We run our business at round about EUR 250 million of internal admin
expenses. And we would add retro costs, because we have to assume that we have to
Page 50 of 76

Company N ame: H annover Rueck SE
Company Ticker: H N R1 GR Equity

pay our retrocessionaires another EUR 100 million, i.e., EUR 0.1 billion. This then is all input
into our capital model. Then, of course, as I said before, we look at the various values for
the govie average, these days 50 base points. We would look at our individual Hannover
Re hybrid costs. And of course, we would set the target for the return on equity. The IFRS
target is 9%, 900 base points, about risk-free. And on the economic capital, 600 base
points, this is a larger capital base. And we would take the higher of. So if one is fulfilled,
we make sure that the other one is fulfilled, too. And of course, we look at the external
calculation, i.e., your expectation at the unlevered or the levered beta and, of course, the
market risk premium. And the factors are listed here.
If we then move to the output, what does actually go into our internal systems out of this
stature? We're arriving at a calculation post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 4.6%.
This is, of course, the external expectation in the hybrid costs brought together. And we
also look at what kind of spread do we need to actually achieve the 900 base points on
IFRS capital. So we calculate 7.5%, that's in our internal systems. And the weighted
average cost of capital spread before tax works out to be in the vicinity of 4.7%.
Now the key to us is the next bullet point. It is, what do we expect to be the cost of
running the business, costs of capital, admin cost and retro cost to write business? And
the third bullet point, minimum margins, we call it, is the cost of capital, the admin cost
and the retro cost as a percentage of premium. So that every underwriter knows if I write
premium, do I need 8% margin? Or do I need 20% margin? Then we are crosschecking
this. This figure is a present value figure. So we are discounting loss reserves with riskfree. And we calculate 7.5%. So in simplistic terms, you could say we break even at 92.5%
combined on a present value basis. And if you then add our costs and if you add our retro
cost, you are more or less around the 96% that you find in the target metrics. I mean, I'm
mixing here underwriting year figures and financial year figures. But since our business is
fairly solid over the years, it's more or less a statement that we can make.
Now what does that mean? And I'm giving you 3 segments here to highlight this. The first
segment at the bottom is nonproportional property category 1. This is high risk, highly
volatile. You can imagine for a minute, this is a book of U.S. cat writings. We need -- or we
needed in 2017 a margin purely for cost of capital of 21.3%. Because of better
diversification, this is going to come down to 19.6% for 2018. So we are better diversified
going into 2018. Then, of course, this segment has to heavily pay for the retro costs, the
whole account, the aggregate covers we are purchasing. So we need 12.2% for retro. And
our allocated expenses are 3.2%. So adding altogether, when we are going to approach
this segment into 2018, we would simply say, we need a margin of 35% on every dollar
we write. Or on the figures here, for premium volume of EUR 175 million, we need EUR 61
million in profits to say we are breakeven, 35% profit, EUR 61 million to be breakeven in
this segment. Highly volatile, extreme capital-intensive, therefore, a high margin required.
And we have hundreds of cells like this. And we measure this very carefully.
The next example, a German motor quota share treaty. The costs of capital are and were
0.7%, very little administration, 0.8%, hardly any retro cost. German catastrophes don't
make it to the whole accounts. They're not big enough from the motor account. And we
are ending up with a 1.5% margin covering us for all the 3 segments. So for a premium
volume of EUR 270 million, we are breakeven at EUR 4.1 million profit. That shows the big
Page 51 of 76

FINAL

variety we have in terms of measuring profit. And of course, aviation, marine, credit and
bond, agriculture are all somewhere in this capital metrics. And on structured business,
the later on emphasis of my presentation, we said, let's assume for a minute we have
EUR 2 billion or slightly more than EUR 2 billion in premium. The costs of capital are coming
down from EUR 1.5% to 1.4%. The admin is almost like a German motor quota share treaty,
not very much to be allocated for admin, 1%. So we're ending up with a margin of 2.4%. So
we would be breakeven in earning our costs of capital if we earn round about EUR 50
million on a EUR 2 billion block of business. It's in volatile business. It is diversifying. So it
doesn't require much capital. So that is the way how we operate.
So how did we do in the last couple of years? And now I want to disturb you a little bit, lots
of arrows and so on. But you can do a simple calculation. We have here the years '11 to '14.
And you can see lots of arrows on the volume up. And you can see lots of pluses in terms
of the profitability. So we were guiding you to expect growth. And we were guiding you to
expect earnings above costs of capital. So when you look at this bottom chart, guided
P&C growth, we were guiding you in terms of 2011 to expect growth. And we achieved
8.4%. We were guiding you to expect significant growth in 2012. There were lots of arrows
up, 7 were actually up. And we achieved 12.3%. We were guiding you not to expect
growth. There were arrows down in 2013. And we achieved, yes, a black growth, a
marginal growth. And the same for 2014. As far as the profitability is concerned, we had
between 6 and 5 pluses on the right-hand side per year. So we were guiding you to
expect earnings above costs of capital. And the xRoCA, the return above the return on
capital adjusted, was between 3% and 10%. A combination of steering, luck, absence of
large losses. But basically what we say is, the true-up shows that our guidance from our
internal system was more or less adequate.
If we go to the more recent years now, the years '15, '16, '17, of course, is yet open. We
were guiding you to expect growth in '15 and limited growth, quite a number of arrows
down in '16. And we achieved 18% growth in '15 and a marginal minus in 2016. So again,
we think we got it right in terms of steering the expectations.
As far as the profitability is concerned, again, 5 pluses each in 2015 and '16. And we
achieved an xRoCA, i.e., earned costs of capital above, 7.4% and 7.1%. Of course, this is
not insignificantly contributed by the fact that we had an absence of large losses. So
actual to modeled was a positive deviation. And that helped to fuel the outperformance.
If I go back now into a bit of history, our U.S. risk portfolio, on the left-hand side, you see
all the volumes. We have constantly grown this portfolio. This is the typical Midwestern
company. All these risk layers, the individual risk that get protected by treaty contracts.
And on the right-hand side, you see various averages of the outperformance over and
above the costs of capital.
If we go to the very right-hand side, you see we had an outperformance of 6% over 21year cycle. I don't know why 21 years were chosen and not 20 years and later on 16 and
not 15. But you can see if we go to the left-hand side, the 11-year average from 2005 to
'15 and the four years from '12 to '15, do not indicate that we were not earning significant
profits above costs of capital. So this is a rock-solid portfolio. We always explained that

Page 52 of 76

FINAL

this risk portfolio is very important for our earning's strengths and actually adds to move
us away in terms of diversification from the cat portfolio.
But let's have a look at the next page, i.e., our cat portfolio. We grew this significantly,
whilst at the same time, this has been discussed several times, the risk appetite came
down. But the outperformance, i.e., what did we earn over and above costs of capital. And
the costs of capital were quite high, was again significant and increasing. So on the righthand side, 21 years, it is lower than the short-term average is, very much fueled by the
absence of large losses.

Bloomberg Transcript

Of course, on the model basis, this would -- result would have looked different. But
because of actual-to-moderate was an outperformance, our cat portfolio also was quite
accretive in terms of overcontribution, excess earnings relative to our cost of capital.
But let me now go and start my part of the Advanced Solutions presentation, with a little
bit of history first and then I drill down deeper. This business, in our organization, has 40plus years of history. And it is a very uneven development. We called it breathing volumes.
They are parts where there is lots of demand, they are areas where there is hardly any
demand. But Hannover Re has constantly had that separate division working with
Advanced Solutions. And there are very particular highlights in the past where this
business saw significant development. The first one was with the introduction of the FASB
113 accounting rule and that was in 1993, because up until that time it was quite difficult to
account these contracts and there were concerns about the accounting rules. And
therefore, many reinsurance managers, many managements, in particular, in the U.S.
didn't touch this business. Then 2001 saw a massive increase. Many of these structures
had so-called loss-sensitive premiums. And because of the soft casualty markets in the
years prior to 2001 at World Trade Center, huge amount of loss-sensitive premiums had
to be paid to us. And how our premium volume moved to almost EUR 2.5 billion in that
year, mostly driven by loss-sensitive premiums. Then, of course, it came down. And we
had a low light with the investigations of the New York Attorney General and the SEC
investigations around misuse of some of the structures. And it took a while. And of
course, we were hoping that with more risk-based capital regimes in the world, eventually,
we would have significantly more demand. And we saw this starting in 2014. And we are
probably right now in the midst of a significantly increased demand environment.
Okay. But now into the details. Let me talk about the various contracts. But before I do so,
Roland was so kind to mention JÃ¼rgen has produced so much successful business and
that's leading to increases in the equalization reserve. It wasn't me. It was the team
Advanced Solutions at Hannover Re, which we have, it's 15 people, they're very strong.
And they are led by Silke Sehm, an experienced Managing Director. And we are
harvesting right now the hard work of the last 10 years of marketing, which did not
translate into production. Right now, it's translating into production. So they had to hold
their breath for quite a while. And now we're seeing the production coming out of hard
marketing work. There were times where different waves of products were in the market.
T&D, which is Time & Distance discounting of loss reserves, not transmission and
distributional lines. So T&D contracts people sold, they are loss reserves to discount
losses. Then we have spread loss covers, then we had aggregate covers close to the risk.
They were also -- they are to actually cede losses and realize the investment income. And
Page 53 of 76

FINAL

Company N ame: H annover Rueck SE
Company Ticker: H N R1 GR Equity

later on, we started contract types called LPT and ADC, Loss Portfolio Transfers and
Adverse Development Covers, where people are selling large blocks of their reserves to
alleviate their capital position. And lately, we have a blend of almost everything, ADC, LPT,
surplus relief covers, aggregate covers. And the companies are blending these structures
according to their needs to optimize 2 things; one, the capital position; and secondly, the
cost of capital. So they are comparing these products with the cost of equity, they're
comparing these products with the cost of hybrid financing. And of course, they're
comparing it with traditional reinsurance. Then they take a judgmental call, which kind of
product they prefer.
We have lots of contracts, I won't go into details. And you can surely call us if you want to
have more details. Spread Loss, multiyear contracts to level off the volatility of P&L
accounts. Stop Loss contracts, frequently purchased on motor and agricultural contracts.
We have Surplus Relief Quota Shares. This is when people overshoot their premium
volumes. And they want to steer their writing capital, they want to steer their solvency
capital or their regulatory capital. We have Loss Portfolio Transfers and ADCs. This is a bit
difficult at times because companies have to disclose their entire actuarial work. Are they
reserved at best estimate? Or do they have sufficient reserve redundancies, like Roland
and Andreas explained. So you look deeply into the heart of an organization when you do
these covers. And therefore, not everyone is ready to buy these covers because they
disclose almost like in a due-diligent situation. Very detailed information about their
organization.
Then, as I said before, today, we have the structure and the combination of all these
segments. What is the difference between traditional and structured? Let me highlight
what structured reinsurance does. The first is, you don't talk to the reinsurance manager
anymore. The reinsurance manager doesn't like it because actually who triggers the
demand is the CFO and the CRO, because they can bear -- compare these products with
financing via their contracts with banks. They look at the pre; and poststructure EP Curves,
the Exceedings Probability curves. And therefore, there is a fundamental shift in whom do
you approach. So the partner whom you approach for these products is the CEO, the
CRO or the CFO. It's no longer the ceded (ring) manager. Yes. That's more on the
traditional side. And of course, many of these transactions are privately placed. Many of
our peers talk about private placements and so on. We don't talk about it because we just
do it. These contracts are there. And they are done, in most cases, 100%. So they don't
go to the public. Of course, later on, there is public disclosure in the U.S., in particular, via
the various official publications and then, eventually, realized -- the public realizes what
deals you have done. But it is not automatically known because this business is not
transacted in the subscription market. The cost of capital and the margins are lower. But
it's less volatile. The standard deviations on some of the businesses are 1 or 2 loss ratio
points. So it's only to cover very narrow movements in the volatility. It's not there to cover
volatility movements of 40 loss ratio points. It's for very solid, short-limit, large-volume
transactions. And of course, it can be deposit accounted and reinsurance accounted. So
sometimes we see it on the top line and sometimes you don't see it on the top line. Uli
has explained that on the financial solutions business on the Life side, not dissimilar there.
These days, very high compliance requirements. Every single contract goes through a
compliance list. So I would dare to say the reputation risk is probably in this segment

Page 54 of 76

Company N ame: H annover Rueck SE
Company Ticker: H N R1 GR Equity

today the lowest of all the transactions we do, because the compliance requirements are
the highest. And the traditional reinsurance you know. So it's an complementary product.
And it's very much in demand these days. And let me give you, in a few minutes, a couple
of examples of these contracts. But before, let me guide you how to read the impact on
the Hannover Re combined ratio. This business, because of low margins, usually produces
combined ratios between 97% and 100%. So if we are growing this business, means that
the total P&C combined ratio it's actually increased. And to be able to demonstrate the
impact, we drilled down into our historic data and said, what would it have been without
this business and how would it look like if we adjust, including the structured reinsurance
business. And you can see that the combined ratio goes up by 0.3% to 0.9%. And makes
it more difficult to, of course, stay within the Board's guidance of a 96% combined ratio.
Low-margin business, relatively high combined ratio is dilutive for the combined ratio of
the P&C group. So if we grow this business rapidly into the next years, that would mean
that there is a increasing impact on the combined ratio of the P&C book.
But now let me give you 3 particular examples how would these contracts be structured.
These are real examples, a little bit denaturalized, if I call it like this. So that you can't draw
conclusions who it is. The first one is a kind of a case study, a live case study on business
we have in our books of U.S. auto business. And what I should highlight here is, it's on a
net basis. So when companies are ceding this business, it's after they purchase the
reinsurance to already take part of the volatility out. So it's already volatility-reduced
business. Why do they buy it? They want to steer the increase in premium, because the
U.S. auto market is hardening right now, the rates are going up. So their premium volume
is growing too quick. So they took out and contacted us a quota share. And suggested a
15% cession to basically take away the load on the capital model as far as the regulatory
capital is concerned. But also, not infrequently, this business is purchased to steer the A.M.
Best rating model. You can see that these businesses are already stable. And what they
do then is, we discuss with them a sliding scale commission. But the swing of the sliding
scale is only 3percentage points. Because if you would make it wider, there would be no
risk transfer anymore. So you have to be very careful in looking at the volatilities and
designing the terms. And you have to blend it in the right way to create a solution that
serves the purpose, has risk transfer, secures mirror accounting and then, of course,
creates a win-win. And of course, by being a net quota share, a contract like this benefits
from all the proceeds from reinsurance purchased on a traditional basis. And contracts like
this we have in our portfolio are between EUR 100 million and even more sizable 3-digit
numbers. And they offer margins of 3%. The capital you require is probably 15% to 20% of
the premium, you're right. So it's fairly ROE accretive, even though it is EBIT margin
dilutive. ROE accretive, EBIT margin dilutive. One thing I also should highlight is if you have
a limited number of larger contracts that having 3 more or having 3 less has quite an
impact on the top line of the P&C group. So whereas, in the past the steering of the
guidance on the growth was easy, it is involving a larger deviation these days, depending
on are we going to get 3 contracts? Are we going to lose 3 contracts? So there is a wider
range on our forecast. But we've tried to guide you as much as is possible and in a correct
way. Then, of course, we sometimes have options to increase the cession, which gives
additional flexibility, no hybrid financing could do that easily. So we can scale up these
transactions without any additional workload. And it's easy for the customer, it's easy for
us. And it doesn't create any admin burden at all.

The second case is a study from Europe, a Solvency II situation. Our customer has still the
standard formula. So no internal model -- no improved internal model. Let's argue it's a
U.K. motor insurer. And of course, they also want to steer their capital requirements. They
don't want to call their shareholders to digest more premium volume. They want to steer
it by the means of reinsurance. They enter into us with a 2-year quota share, not a single
year. There must be a planning horizon. And it's, again, a net quota share. But U.K. motor
is much more volatile. So of course, the sliding scale has a wider swing to again maximize
the requirements and the return and the cost of capital requirements. And of course,
what we also add here is a particular feature that if, for example, somebody doesn't want
to commute after 2 or three years, where such a quota share is not used anymore in the
capital model, we have a feature in that they would have to pay us a maintenance fee.
Because if they want us to still retain reserves on our balance sheet, they must serve our
reserves with a margin. This is usually structured as a penalty. So that they are encouraged
to commute, which makes it short tail-ish and not long tail. And you remember Andreas
saying, well, why do we have less liability reserves? We have increases in U.K. motor. But
because of this feature, the reserves don't sit on our balance sheet for a long time. So
they get commuted early on. And they are not running off for 9 or 15 years.
And the third case is a study from APAC. It's an aggregate cover. And many of our
customers. And I think very soon there will be more demand in the U.S. too, realized that
they've moved their retentions too high up. And if you have a number of frequency
losses, the P&L is hit badly. They may not be big enough to go straight into the cat covers.
And if you have a Third Quarter like the Third Quarter we all shared this year, then, of
course, you have the need for protecting your company against the aggregate of all the
cat losses. And we have structured these contracts on a multiyear basis. But for us it's very
important that they cannot be hit by a single loss, because they are not meant to replace
vertical cat covers. But only protect frequency. And by having this strict requirement, this
business is diversified. If there is one big loss, these covers don't get it. If there is a
frequency of smaller losses and the vertical covers don't get it. Again, there is
diversification. So this business helps us actually to diversify positively. And because it's
multiyear, allows the customers to plan their reinsurance budget. So very much in demand
in countries where you have multiple exposures of wind and earthquake. And they want to
protect against frequency.
Okay. So to sum up, we see a significant demand increase. And I would not be surprised if
we can, at the end of 2018, report, again, it was a successful year. In the end, it requires
the seller and the buyer to be successful. But the probabilities are high. It's xRoCA
accretive. But it has got a deteriorating impact on EBIT margins in P&C. It's probably
behind the comma for the time being because it's not big enough yet, EUR 2 billion to
EUR 10 billion. But if it becomes more then, at one point in time, we have to make up our
mind, are we still able to reduce the 10% EBIT margin in our target matrix? So we will
carefully steer the growth here. And of course, the combined ratio goes up a little bit, yet
it pays us well for the capital deployed. It's diversifying, because it's lower risk and it's only
correlated to NatCat if you have a frequency and large losses. Then, of course, there is a
positive correlation. And what we also like is the communication to the top management
of all our customers, because once we get a reputation tick. And Hannover is regarded as
a suitable partner that opens up the doors for the traditional reinsurance business too.
And we get a favorable treatment for our traditional colleagues as well.

So that concludes my presentation on growth. It's always just a selected summary of
some segments. Of course, in other segments, you were so kind to ask all the questions
about what will happen post these events to my colleagues before. So that I don't have to
answer any of these anymore.

FINAL

And well -- but I'm ready to start the Q&A session.
+++qanda

A - Karl Steinle

{BIO 1986424 <GO>}

Okay. Well thank you for that detailed presentation. We start on the left-hand side with
Andrew.

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Two -- one quick question. Did you say there was EUR 2 billion of premium income now
altogether?

A - JÃ¼rgen GrÃ¤ber
It's moving towards.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Maybe, because the table has -- there was a big billion in '16. And the second question,
really, it all sounds a bit too good to be true as in this business is arranged on sliding scale.
So that essentially the cedents benefiting and you can't lose money. So where can it go
wrong? When has it gone wrong? Just an example in the past.

A - JÃ¼rgen GrÃ¤ber
Well you're probably right in saying that it's too good to be true. But please bear in mind
that the capital benefit that cedents' getting is also limited. So they don't get full benefit
like they would get on traditional reinsurance. It's just another product line. Where has it
gone wrong? Usually, if somebody would buy a surplus relief contract to branch out into a
new line of business. And one assumes the past experience from that core business will
also apply to the new line of business. We have lately had some losses where this
additional new lines of business did not deliver according to plan. So it's quite advisable to
do these structures only on established codebooks. And that is a lesson we had to learn
the hard way.

A - Karl Steinle

{BIO 1986424 <GO>}

Okay. Any further question? That doesn't seem to be the case. Oh, Vinit? Well try it.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Just a very data-check question, sorry. Slide 14 says that there is 80 basis points uplift
from combined ratio points in 1H, because I distinctly remember in the call, in the results it
Page 57 of 76



Company N ame: H annover Rueck SE
Company Ticker: H N R1 GR Equity
Date: 2017-10-19

was meant to be 30 basis points. Is there some change in that, just to check?

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

FINAL

Vinit, you are right in mentioning the study, it was 30 basis points. But we were only
referring to the -- because of the difference between, I think, the additional business,
which we have -- had (inaudible). And not the ones we would be able to report (inaudible).

A - JÃ¼rgen GrÃ¤ber
And of course, secondly, some part of the answer is in Andrew's question about the
volume. Of course, to the extent that the volume is going up, the impact gets more
severe. You will recall that on -- I don't know, was it the renewals call? We said, we can't
quantify. But we will go deeper into the assessment. And then a larger volume plus
Roland's explanation maybe is the best possible answer.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And can I follow a second question? Last year in the renewals call in January, I remember
there was a lot of attention on your comments as well on the slides as well, that the cat
XL was being written below cost of capital. And the idea was that because the budget
was not being met. So it was okay. But this year with the budget clearly being met and
exceeded, would you say that the cat excess of loss, cost of capital, obviously, you've
taken down a bit. But would you still be writing that aggressively and that will be the plan,
just a confirmation, please?

A - JÃ¼rgen GrÃ¤ber
First, we're not taking down the cost of capital on cat business. In this particular category 1,
just an impact of a minor reduction of cost of capital. We're not taking down the cost of
capital per definition. It's always the impact of the internal, full-model calculation. I would
dare to say that if the costs of capital are fully paid in cat business, then, of course, we will
use the headroom available in the budget and go to a high utilization. That is what we
would always have said and should it go beyond. And now we probably know when we
have seen all the Third Quarter releases, then, of course, should it be raining cream, then
we would even contact the Executive Board for a wider risk allocation. That we haven't
done yet, because we have enough headroom in the utilization frame. But that remains to
be seen and, probably, it will be a late renewal. So some will be waiting as long as
possible, maybe, not to pay higher prices. More we know after all the conferences, more
we know after the Third Quarter releases. And right now, as Uli highlighted, the range is
too wide to draw conclusions of what happens in the market. We have said our
underwriting teams not to accept at all reductions. And then to test the market, to go as
high as possible without losing the business. Doesn't sound like-like it. It sounds like a
regular wisdom. But many underwriters have never seen a hard market.

A - Karl Steinle

{BIO 1986424 <GO>}

Okay. We have another question. So on the very left side. (Charles)?

Q - Unidentified Participant
Page 58 of 76



Company N ame: H annover Rueck SE
Company Ticker: H N R1 GR Equity

Just a quick question. I mean, if you go back long enough, once upon a time, you used to
split up the alternative risk transfer business as a separate segment. Is that something you
might contemplate doing again in order to, sort of, preserve the purity of the P&C
numbers?

FINAL

A - JÃ¼rgen GrÃ¤ber
No. I would -- we haven't discussed it in the Executive Board. But I remember those times.
I am one of the old, gray hair guys at the Executive Board. When we had that separated,
yes. And there was a time, too, when we had primary activities separated for another
reason. Ever since Uli's took over, we merged as much as we could to have 1 big P&L. And
the only natural division we have is really between P&C, Life & Health and investments. So
I doubt that we would split it further as far as P&C is concerned. Rather, we would create a
bit more transparency in the external communication. But not starting a separate P&L
where there's full set of separate reporting requirements. I can't see that at this point in
time.

Q - Unidentified Participant
So this is just a slightly different tool in the toolbox, not a difference in the way in which
you manage the business?

A - JÃ¼rgen GrÃ¤ber

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, has always been. Yes.

A - Karl Steinle

{BIO 1986424 <GO>}

Okay. Another one from Andrew.

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Sorry, just a quick follow-up. Just to understand the capital allocation. You are allocating
diversification to each business line gets some of the diversification credit for the group. Is
that how it works?

A - JÃ¼rgen GrÃ¤ber
The answer is yes. And the mechanism is the T-bar.

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay. So it's looked at as a whole. Then, second, typical structure. And I guess, it's going
to be a fashionable thing to talk about in the next six months, the cat aggregate excess of
loss multiyear cat aggregate. Typically, is that -- do you -- can you adjust that within the 3year period? Will the client come back to you and say, well, we've eroded quite a large
part of our deductible? Can we have a bit more? Or is it -- that's it, three years locked in?
What was the typical kind of structure?

A - JÃ¼rgen GrÃ¤ber
Page 59 of 76

Let me split the answer into 2 parts. The first one is, it will not be the only demand,
aggregate covers. We will also see demand then that is what Uli brought back from the
CIAB meetings, more demand for sub-layers, because some of the customers realized
they actually have a too high retention. So there will be demand into sub-layers and
buying further down on vertical covers. And the second then is frequency. And here, it
depends on structures. You can have multiyear flat premium for all the years. You can
have loss-sensitive premium in. For argument sake, if there is no -- if there is a massive
loss in year 1 on a 5-year contract that you then have a step-up premium for the further
four years, or you can have a very high upfront premium. And a PC at the very end if there
were no claims. So you have all sorts of structures. This depends on which companies
overpay and like P&C. Those who stay closer to the wind go for the lower-priced version
and accept loss-sensitive premium if unexpected claims come very early. So it depends
on the behavior of the customer.

A - Karl Steinle

{BIO 1986424 <GO>}

Okay. Any further question? This does not seem to be the case. It's almost coffee time.
Before we go into the break, I'd like to remind you about the questionnaire and the
feedback form, which is on your table. So as I said at the beginning, we really highly value
your comments and feedback.
We will resume at 3:30 with the presentation of Claude ChÃ¨vre. Thank you.

(technical difficulty)
it's at least according to current applicable and international accounting standards. And
yes, you have guessed right, it's Claude's turn now.

A - Claude Jacques ChÃ¨vre

{BIO 21916781 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much. Close the door. Yes. The title of my presentation is since of -our presentation, Klaus and myself's presentation is since four years the same. It's insights
into life and health reinsurance. And if you go back into the history a little bit, what we
presented four years ago, remember, four years ago, we changed our target metrics on
the life and health side. And we had -- at that time, we had an EBIT margin target for the
whole of life and health's business, which was 6%. And four years ago, while I was
explaining you why we changed the EBIT margin target into different EBIT margin. So we
had 6% for the whole of the life and health business. And then we changed it and we said,
let's make it differentiated. And let's take 6% for mortality and morbidity solutions, let's
take 2% for longevity and financial solutions. And I explained to you where these different
EBIT margins came from. And you remember, we looked into the different types of
business. For those of you who have been here, we looked into stochastic simulations, we
looked into economic capital that you need for each type of business. And we said the
more volatile the business is, the more economic capital you need, we have want to have
Page 60 of 76

900 bps on top of a risk-free return on this economic capital. So we take this value, we
add our admin expenses. And we take this value, we divide it through the premium. And
we divide from that the EBIT margin. And that's the way we were presenting these
different EBIT margins. It's pretty much the same as JÃ¼rgen explained in his first section
this morning on the P&C business -- sorry, this afternoon, sorry, JÃ¼rgen, on the P&C
business. So that was four years ago. Then, three years ago, we said, okay. But there is
another thing in our target matrix, which is the value of new business. And we realized that
nobody really understood exactly how we derive this value through business. And
remember, it was a whole hour where we discussed about how we derived the value
through business, present value of future profits that we take and then we deduct the
cost of capital, we deduct the expenses and that's the value of new business. That was
three years ago. two years ago, Klaus was presenting some of our interesting things that
we have in the life and health environment. Remember that in 2013, if I remember well,
we had to increase our reserves for the DII business in Australia. So we took this as an
opportunity for Klaus, then we explained how the DII business works. He explained also
how the mortality solutions business works. So these were the kind of things that we did
and the longevity business. one year ago, that was last year, Klaus explained the financial
solutions business. Because we realized that financial solutions becomes the more and
more important. But all this each time under the same topic, which is insights into life and
health reinsurance.
And now you have heard from Uli this morning that we have changed again our target
matrix on the life and health side. And we decided to get rid of this EBIT margin, because
we realized that EBIT margin, even though we had different EBIT margins, 2% and 6%, is
not really a good measure for our business, because on the financial solutions business,
given that you book only the results. So it's -- so you don't have any premium. So you will
end up with very high EBIT margins, which is very clear. On longevity, you still have the EBIT
margins that we were disclosing, which is 2%, 3%, 4%. So even this mix did not make too
much sense. And the morbidity and mortality, you have the same situation. You have
morbidity business, which needs a lot of EBIT margin, because there is a lot of volatility.
You have morbidity business, which needs much less EBIT margin, because there is much
more stability. So even this, at the end we decided, makes not too much sense. So we
said, we have now in the target matrix a global EBIT growth target. So we look into the full
EBIT. So let me start, maybe, with this first slide, which is trivial. These are the figures that
you know already. So here you see our value of new business that we have been showing
over from 2012 to 2016, which is the blue bars. Then you see the EBIT that we have been
showing. Now still whenever I discuss with you guys, be it in roadshows, be it in those
Investors' Day, I -- there was always a kind of a wish which came from you guys which said
-- just said, that's very nice. But can anybody explain us how you -- or we can and you can
translate the value of new business that we were showing here? Which is a very nice
figure. And look at this, it's more than EUR 800 million that we showed in 2016. How can
we translate this into future EBIT? So I thought now that we changed the target matrix.
And we're really looking to VNB. We have a VNB target. Are we looking to an EBIT? I think
it will be interesting now to show how we can -- how you can derive, from the VNB that we
write, our EBIT into the future. And this is the topic of today's presentation.
So these are figures you know already. And in order to do this, this link from VNB to EBIT,
we need to make detour via cash flows, because the point is that VNB is a Solvency II
measure. And I'm going to explain this afterwards quickly, whereas EBIT, EBIT is an IFRS
Page 61 of 76

FINAL

Company N ame: H annover Rueck SE

measure. And for us, for Hannover Re Group, IFRS is U.S. GAAP. So in order to get this link
between the 2 of them, we need to go via the cash flows. So let me start maybe with the
first part, which is, how do we get from VNB into cash flows? Well maybe just another slide
on the VNB. Like the first time when we looked into VNB a few years ago, VNB was still
based on the MCEV reporting, as you see on the left side here, which is local statuary
results, which is post-tax, 4.5% cost of capital. You see that this was the case until 2015.
That's -- that was the case when I first talked about value of new business. This definition
has changed. And the new definition of value of new business, you see it in the middle, is
that it's based on the Solvency II reporting. It's based on cash flows. And that's the reason
why we look into cash flows. It's a pretax basis. And you have this famous 6% cost of
capital, which is called the risk margin under Solvency II. So you have a totally new
definition of the VNB. And by the way, in 2021, don't ask me what the definition of the VNB
is. This is IFRS 17. So I am going to look into the future. But I'm not going to look further
than 2021 in this presentation, definitely not, because we don't know what's going on. So
this is the VNB that we're showing. That -- so let me take an example -- let me take 2016
as an example, quickly. And this is the VNB that we have been showing. It was something
like -- you see this on the upper-right hand of the slide, you see EUR 893 million. Now how
did we get to this VNB? Let's make now a retroactive engineering, if you want. Well what
we did is, well, if you add to this VNB the risk margin, the cost of capital, then the value,
that the way you get to this is the following: Well you look into the future cash flows, that's
the business -- the new business that you are writing in 2016 is going to generate. And
you see these cash flows here. These are the gray bars. Then you take the present value
of these future cash flows, you discount them back, you deduct the cost of capital, which
is the red bar. And you get to the VNB. So it's a little bit the other way around that I
showed it to you now. What you see on this slide. And that's quite interesting, you see -- I
think like this, yes. You see that in the -- and this is five years. So you have -- you're 5, 10,
15. So be careful, it's not every single year. You see now the cash flows that this value of
new business that we have been writing in 2016 is going to generate. And if you look at it,
you see that in the first 10 years we will generate a positive cash flow, which is above EUR
1 billion, out of this value of new business that we have been generating. Okay? So this is
very interesting.
Now this is the whole of the VNB, the whole of the life and health portfolio. Very difficult to
interpret. So what I suggest now is that we try to segment this VNB and take 4 different
typical life and health segments and have a look into them. So let's segment this and let's
take 4 segments, which is on the one hand side, on the left top side you have the financial
solutions fee deals, then you have the longevity RPATs, a regular premium annuity
treaties. Previously, we called them longevity swaps. Then you have the U.S. mortality
standard business. And you have the whole rest. Now you cannot take the size of these
bars. Don't take them, for the time being, into account. I just normalized them so that they
look all the same size. Of course, they are not all the same size. But if you go now quickly
into each of these types of business. And we look into the cash flows that these types of
business represent. And I will show it afterwards, cash flows are not equal to results, of
course. But let's have a look into the cash flows. And let's start with the financial solution
fee deals. A financial solution fee deal. And you know what it is, Klaus explained it for 1
hour a year ago. Very little risk. And you see the risk margin, which is the small red bar
block there, it's very, very small. So very, very little risk. A very high VNB that we generate.
And you see that the cash flow that these deals are generating into the future are pretty

Page 62 of 76

FINAL

high. So you see very high flat cash flows over the next 10 years. So that's kind of a shortterm business for the life and health treaties. So that's the financial solution business.
Now if we go a different one, which is a longevity's business. A longevity business, you
see it's much more longer term. So you're sitting on these longevity blocks for 50-plus
years. So you see it's generating -- longevity deal is generating a positive cash flows for
50-plus years. You see, longevity, a little bit more risk involved. That's why you see that
the red bar block there, which is a little bit higher than on the financial solutions side. But
still not very, very risky. So that's the reason why 2% EBIT margin, as we said as a minimum
EBIT margin previously is enough for longevity. But you see here, cash flows, at the
beginning, a little bit lower. Why? Because we deduct from these cash flows the admin
expenses. So when you write a deal, most of the costs for writing the deal is when you
price it, when you look into that. So at the beginning, we have higher cost. We have to set
up all the systems, the monitoring systems. And once it's in, it generates positive cash
flows. And by the end when the treaty runs off, when the portfolio runs off, when you have
less -- much less risk in the portfolio, the costs are going to be higher than the cash flows.
And that's why you have the negative cash flows at the very end. But that's 50-years plus.
So this is the cash flow pattern of a longevity swap.
That next one is a financial -- is a U.S. mortality business. It's a typical, typical mortality
solution business, where you see, very risky, well, it's mortality, we have talked about it. So
you see the red bar, which is very, very high. And you see then here a typical cash flow
pattern of a risk premium mortality business from the U.S. Risk premium means that the
premium that you get becomes at the beginning, becomes the bigger and bigger,
because people get older and older. So the older you get, the higher the risk premium.
So that's why the cash flows are going up. And at the very end, again, when the portfolio
becomes smaller, the cash flow might even get negative. But again, what I wanted to say
what I showed before, if you discount all these cash flows, you will get to the full bar,
which is this blue plus red bar in every single of these cases, of course. So this is mortality
solutions.
And if I take the less -- the last one, which is the whole rest. The whole rest is made of
different types of business. This looks a little bit like a P&C cash flow by the way, I would
say. You have some nonproportional business, where -- you have some single-premium
business. So you get a very high cash flow at the beginning. And you pay the claims later.
You have -- take the typical kind of DII business, which would also fall into this chapter,
Latin American short-term business, single premium, et cetera, et cetera. This is the rest.
So I just wanted to show you the different cash flows that we have on the life and health
book.
So this concludes the first bit. So we know now how we get from VNB to cash flows, or in
principle what we're doing we're getting from cash flows to VNB. The second bit, of
course, is the next. I mean, how do you get from cash flows into EBIT? And I already told
you, cash flows are not equal to EBIT. So let me take a very trivial, easy example of a levelpremium treaty. So a level-premium treaty mortality business means that the consumer
and we were getting the same premium for 10 years, in this example, the same premium.
Now it's very clear that the person who buys this policy, his mortality goes up, which
means that the premium that he pays at the beginning is higher than what we need. And

FINAL

at the very end, of course, the premium is too low. What means that the cash flows that
we see was the same premium in year 1 are very positive, because the premium is a level
premium. So we get more premium than what we need. Then they become slightly
negative until the very end, the cash flows become negative. But this is not the pattern of
the results that we would show for this type of treaty. So let's have a look into that quickly.
So these are the cash flows, again. Just a little bit smaller.
So what comes into my mind, is to following. And let me go back, maybe, here. Right
here, we have a very positive cash flow. It's clear that we're not going to show this
positive cash flow as a result. So what we're going to do is we take a bit of this cash flow
and we reserve it for the days where we expect negative cash flows under IFRS. You know
that we set up the reserves in order to have a kind of a stable IFRS EBIT (inaudible) result.
This is due to reserving methodology of IFRS. So we try to stabilize the result through the
whole duration of the treaty. So the way we do it in this treaty is easy. We set up the
reserves. You see this here, the blue bar. So the blue bar, we set it up in the first year. We
continue to set it up as long as the cash flows are positive. And then we start to eat into
the reserves as soon as the cash flows become negative. And the result of this can be
seen here, you see. These are the positive cash flows. This is the reserve -- this is the fact
that we set up the reserves. So it goes negatively down and then -- and we can't continue
here. When you have a negative cash flow, then we release reserves, et cetera, et cetera,
et cetera. Of course, on these reserves, we're on interest. So this is again another -- and
look at this another positive impact. So this is not a positive impact for our results. And the
results that we show at the end is the delta. And you see under IFRS, if you do the
reserving right, yes, you will see that the IFRS profits very nicely -- nice and stable over the
whole duration of the treaty. Okay, you see, I just wanted to demonstrate to you that cash
flow is not equal to reserve -- is not equal to EBIT in principle. Now there are certain
treaties where cash flows are pretty much equal to the result. If you take a longevity swap,
where all you do is you swap premium and you pay it every year, you might say that the
cash flow minus the other expenses are pretty much results. But in a standard life treaty,
cash flows are not equal to results. Okay. So just to clarify that.
Now I want to just to make and open a short bracket before I go to VNB EBIT. And the
bracket is really to show you the difference quickly between IFRS reserving and Solvency II
resolving. And there are some basic differences. I mean, IFRS, as I told you before, U.S.
GAAP standard Solvency II, Solvency II standard. Now the profit realization, as I showed
you in the previous example, in IFRS is over time. So you try really to make sure that you
have a nice stable profit stream. Whereas on the Solvency II reserving, it's all the way
different. You show the profits at the inception of the treaty. And you show that the full
VNB. And we will see this afterwards. The full value of new business is shown as a positive
result at the inception of the treaty. And afterwards, you're not going to show any results
apart from the risk margin, totally different way of looking to this. Then you have locked-in
assumptions under IFRS. You have heard about that many times already, which is not the
case under Solvency II. Under Solvency II, you always go on the best estimate basis. And
you will see this afterwards in some examples. When you see that the business is better
than foreseen you really realize the profits as soon as you see it. When it's worse, you
realize the loss as soon as you see it, which is not the case under IFRS. And you will see
that. Then you have, of course, on the IFRS what we call provisions for adverse deviation.
And this is an old system based upon U.S. GAAP when you still didn't have any computers.
So people needed to have some easy system to add some security. Today with the

computers, you have Solvency II, you have an explicit risk margin. This is Solvency II risk
margin. And with (constant) simulations you know it better than me. This is much more
complicated on the right than on the left. The concept is same. But the way you calculate
it is much more different -- much different. Then you have a DAC. So deferred acquisition
costs, which is a concept you know under IFRS, which is a concept we don't know under
German HGB, for example. That's also something, which is very typical, because if you did
not have the concept of a DAC, you will show a very negative reserve in the first year of
writing a treaty. Given that under IFRS, you want to have nice profit streams, you -- we
introduced -- they introduced a DAC, which allows you then again to defer all these
acquisition costs over the whole duration of the treaty. This is not needed under Solvency
II.
On day 1, you show the full VNB of your treaty. And the full VNB includes that, includes all
the costs that you will have in the future so you have the DAC for under Solvency II. Then,
of course, you have interest rates locked in and floating interest rates. So these are the
main differences. But let me maybe, take an example. A few example of few scenarios,
this is purely theoretical to show you a bit what's going on. The cash flows under both
regimes, let's suppose they are the same or we can suppose they are the same, under
IFRS and Solvency II. So now what is not the same is this reserve pattern. We have seen
this reserve pattern before for the example of this level-term treaty, okay? So this is
reserve pattern for an IFRS accounting. And this is the reserve pattern for Solvency II.
When you see at the beginning of a Solvency II treaty, you book a negative reserve, which
has the value of the -- value of new business, the VNB. So this year is nothing else than
the VNB. So you book the VNB as a negative reserve and then you have to reserve
changes so that you earn just the risk margin. I don't want to go too much in detail. But this
is -- there are really fundamental differences in the way you set up the reserves under
both regimes.
So let's have a look now at the combination. So this one, you know it already. You have
seen it before. That's the IFRS way of looking into the business. Now this is the way you
will show profits under Solvency II. Under Solvency II, as I said before, shown this very
positive profit in year 1 or year 0, which is the VNB. And all you show in the future years
under Solvency II is the risk margin, tiny, tiny risk margin. Whereas you will see -- you show
nice profits every single year.
What I would like to do now with you is show a few examples of what's going on when we
realize in the life section, that's maybe the business is going less well than what we
thought. And if the business is going better. So let's go into -- here we have the bigger. So
we have the bigger screen, I forgot that. We focused on that one. So you see, again, the
same picture I showed you before. Now let's go into one scenario here, which is you take
the scenario where we write the business under year 5. As a %, we see, Jesus we got it
wrong. We need to -- the business is not as good as we thought. What happens under
IFRS reserving? You see what happens is that under IFRS, as long as your reserves are big
enough to take the hit, that means as long as your provisions for adverse deviation, or
your PADs, your future profits that you have within your reserves are big enough, you trust
it into these reserves. And you just -- nothing happens in principle you see. Nothing
happens -- let me maybe make it a little bigger. Yes, here. Yes, nothing happens. Your
future reserves as of year 5 -- sorry, profits as of year 5 are simply a little bit less than

Page 65 of 76



FINAL

what you expected. So that's all what happens under IFRS. Under Solvency II, as I told you
before, you realize in year 5, Jesus, the treaty is not performing well. You need to take
the hit. You're going to take this hit completely, because you don't have any reserves. You
don't have any PADs. You don't have any future profits that you can eat into it. So you take
the hit completely. And you continue to book into the future your risk margin. That's a
totally different way of looking into that. Now that's an easy way under IFRS, super.
Everything is fine. We take another example, where we assume in year 5, you have even
more losses and let's assume that our loss that we have in year 5 is so big that our
reserves are not enough. So we have to unlock this treaty, this business. Yes. So we unlock
this business, which means we take a hit in IFRS. And the hit we take is defined in a way
that we don't make any future profits from that moment on into the future. You see, there
is no profit that you're going to make into the future. You take the full year and you
assume that the treaty will be neutral, no profits anymore. That's IFRS unlocking event.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now under Solvency II, exactly the same as before. Under Solvency II, the hit you take is
again just a little bit bigger, because the hit was bigger, you see that. Yes? Then you
continue to show the risk margin. A totally different way of looking into it.
Now let's take another example. I think that's also an interesting one, where you have a
positive assumption and that also happens within the life business. And you will
understand now why we don't talk about positive assumption changes, okay? Some of
you -- I have explained it to you 100 times, okay. But the thing is, if you have a positive
assumption change in year 5 under IFRS. And that's where we are today. What happens is,
nothing. You see that all you do is you increase the future profits by a tiny little bit
because, again, under IFRS you want to have a nice standard profit stream. So these
positive assumption changes are not seen. You don't talk about. We have seen the
negative ones, yes. The positive ones, no. You will see them. But over the whole duration
of the treaty. Whereas under Solvency II, again, totally different. Under Solvency II, you see
positive assumption change in year 5. You take the hit, the positive hit. So you have to
show the additional VNB, if you want to call it like that, that you're going to make. So you
show it in year 5. And you continue to show the risk margin. Again, totally different ways of
looking into it. Yes.
Okay. So much more details in this report. I do admit, I haven't read it. But you can read it.
There are much more details on how this works. I came with a very simplified way, as
usual, okay, on these things.
Now let's go to what I wanted to show you at the end. So now I close the brackets. That's
what I wanted to show you and what we wanted to show you since years, is how does the
VNB. And now I take you 2016, now we go then afterwards then backwards. How does this
EUR 800 million or close to EUR 900 million VNB in 2016 translate into EBIT, into IFRS
EBIT? Okay. And here you see the figures. So the EUR 900 million translates into '17, into
these figures are between EUR 140 million and EUR 160 million. So approximately EUR 160
million. And then it goes down, of course, it runs off. But that's the way the 2016 VNB is
come in Europe. We're going to go a little bit more into detail. Now let me add another
year, 2015. So 2015, we had EUR 500 million -- more than EUR 500 million VNB. And you
see the emergence of the VNB here, every single year, an additional EUR 40 million also,
of course, running off, which is the expected EBIT we get out of this business. And I

continue without going into detail to 2014, 2013, 2012. And I stop there. And I went only to
2020, because in 2021, I have no clue what's happening, okay. So you see here, if you
look at it, you see the total VNB that we have been writing from 2012 to 2016, this is new
business. I always told you, you have to measure us on the new business that we write,
that's important. It is going to generate an EBIT in 2017 of EUR 300 million. And then it
goes down to EUR 250 million in 2020. This is guaranteed EBIT. You get that, okay,
according to our calculations. Of course, you can always have assumptions changes. But I
can tell you one thing that on the new business we have been writing since 2012, the
assumption changes have been minor, very small assumption changes in both directions.
So you can believe these figures, okay.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now let's have a closer look into this EBITs here. And let's make it more explicit at this
time, where we say -- but the same figures that you have here, okay. So I take these
figures here, I forget about VNB now. VNB it's off, yes, EBIT. And I take the same figures
while I'm looking into the year when they from where they came. I look into the type of
business and we have looked into 4 segments that is providing us with these EBITs. And
you see the most important part is related to financial solution fees. You see, the financial
solution fees are expecting to give us close to EUR 200 EBIT in 2017. And then you see
these EBITs, they are massive. And remember, I showed you the cash flows of the
financial solutions deals. And you remember the cash flows are pretty short. So you made
the cash quite quickly. It's not very long term. And you see this here, that means the VNB
write translates quite quickly into EBIT. And that's why you have those white bar -- those
blue bars, which are quite massive, very important.
Now if you take the next moment to U.S. mortality, the new business that we're writing,
you see the EBIT contribution is slightly going up. I don't know if you can see that. That's
because of what I told you before. The risk premium given that people get older is
increasing slowly at the beginning and then afterwards, the portfolio runs off. So that's
why you expect higher EBITs from the U.S. mortality business into the future. So that's why
you see this pattern. Then the longevity, very stable, of course. And don't forget that this
year is continuing for another 50 years, okay. I didn't show it to you. I have to see how we
account for it under IFRS '17. But this continues on longevity. So longevity creates a big
VNB. But it emerges very slowly into EBIT. But that's the reality and then you have the
other business, which is just up here. So that's quite interesting, I guess. Yes.
This maybe -- this is also an interesting slide, where we show now, again, how much EBIT
we have been producing. And we're expecting from these businesses from 2012 to 2016.
And you see here the total EBITs that we have been showing in the past, these are the
figures I showed you in the very first slide. And you see here that you have a run rate of,
let's say, about EUR 300 million with some special effects. And remember this year is our
special reserving exercise. We had, in Australia, it was something like EUR 100 million. This
is to be communicated that long. This is under DII business. And this year was where 2
financial solution deals, which were recaptured by the client and the client had to pay a
recapture fee. So we cashed in everything that we've expected to get over the next 10
years, we cashed it in, in one single year. So these are the 2 different -- the 2 elements
that I wanted to mention on that one.

Now, of course, now look at this graph. And -- I mean, what you have to add to this graph,
is before me. If you want to have an idea what's going on with life in the future. Of course,
you need also to think that we're not sitting here and now sitting on a run-off, because if
we didn't do anything, it will continue like this, more or less, plus anything we have written
the past. But of course, we're writing new business. So in your assumptions, you need also
to think that new business is coming in. And the new business that is coming in is probably
having a pattern, which could be -- now I'm just guessing, okay, which could look like this.
So the new business we're writing in 2017 might give us that much EBIT in 2018. And this
one in 2019, this one in 2020. So you could imagine here a dotted line, which goes up like
this, slightly. Yes. This is the business out of -- this is the EBIT that we generate out of new
business. Now what you have to add and what you have to deduct, of course, is any
influence of the rest of the portfolio, because we have looked into the portfolio as of
2012. Of course, mortality solutions and all the issues you know, they are part of the
portfolio. And they might have a positive or negative impact. And you know that better
than me. But that's the way you could look into that. Okay? Good.
Now what's I wanted to tell you now is, of course, well can you believe me that we're
going to do these EBITs into the future? This is a bit of where do we think on the life
mortality side that EBIT is -- that the VNB is going to be generated in the future? And for
that, I would like to show you this slide that you all know this is a slide from our standard
pack. We show this slide since four years. This is our strategy. Let me just have -- do I still
have a minute? Or yes, I still have some minutes. So let me just quickly go through this
slide. So what you see here is very nice. You see what the activities are that we are having
on the life and health reinsurance side. So we have on the one hand, we have traditional
reinsurance. This is traditional. This is the quota share, surplus, Stop Loss, cat XL,
excessive loss, very standard risk solutions, that's clear. The second part we have is the
financial solution side. It is the U.S. financial solutions. But also financing goes into financial
solutions. Then, of course, we have the third part, which is services. Because on the life
and health side, you need to provide services to get the business. So these are the
activities we have. And our strategy that we have on the life and health side, the same as
on the P&C is that we say, out of all the possibilities that we have within the reinsurance
side, I'd love whatever we could do, we want to concentrate on these things, which
provide us positive economic value, which provide us a positive value of new business.
And this is what we show here, it is triangle, I don't know if you see this gray triangle. This
is the attractive part of the whole reinsurance business that we can write. Of course, the
road is not black and white. And sometimes, we accept maybe a small business out here,
because we get a big, big chunk of business within the profit of the business. So we look
into that in a commercial view. But the goal is really to increase our share within this
triangle, which is the share of attractive business, which means business with a positive
value from business VNB. That's the way we look into it. And in order to decide and to
explain what we do on the life and health side, we try to put a little bit of structure into this
market. And what we introduced and you know this already, we introduced 5 dimensions.
It's totally trivial. We said that reinsurance landscape is made of markets. Within these
markets, you have insurance companies. These insurance companies, they use
distribution channels to access their end consumers. And what they sell to these end
consumers is risk protection at the end. Yes. So these are the dimensions. And what we
did is we defined for every single of these dimensions we defined, where we think the
sweet spot is for us, for Hannover Re, life and health. And these are the sweet spots. And
what I would like to tell you right now quickly is where we think out of these sweet spots,
Page 68 of 76

we will get the positive VNB into the future. So let me start with this box here. Risk
solutions, we see plenty of possibilities right now still in the U.S. mortality market. So the
new business, the new mortality solutions business that we're writing is VNB positive, is
good business and we continue to write it. And we expect positive VNB out of the U.S.
mortality assumptions. The financial solutions, we expect positive VNBs out of the financial
-- U.S. financial solutions business. We have a huge pipeline. These are not always as big
as we have seen in the past. But there are lot of opportunities we see out of financial
solutions business into the future. They are going to generate positive VNB.
Talking about high-growth markets. We see plenty of opportunities on longevity, which is a
high-growth market for us. And I'm not focusing on the U.K., I focus on the rest of the
world. So plenty of possibilities on longevity. And we see also plenty of opportunities in
China, high-growth market. It's a huge opportunity. If we look into the Chinese market,
these are just volumes, which are incredible. So the opportunity is there. But we need to
tackle this opportunity correctly. Then if you look into companies in transition, that's the
second dimension. We see huge opportunities in block transactions, in big deals, valueenforce deals, where companies want to get rid, either of their insurance business, if it's a
bank or where they want to cash in the future positive cash flows that they're expecting.
So we see plenty of opportunities. And we have seen plenty of deals in Europe but also in
Australia. And we see a pipeline, which is still there. And we think that we're going to have
positive VNBs out of this business too.
Then if you look into alternative distribution channels, we see plenty of possibilities to
work with Fintech companies, be it in the U.S., be it in South Africa, be it in China, who
provide us with a very alternative distribution channel and new digital distribution channel
and where we combine our services. And here I get to this block here of automated
underwriting systems, which are state-of-the-art. And we -- as we mentioned it, we spend
quite some money on that state-of-the-art automated underwriting system, where we
combine our automated underwriting system, our risk knowhow with their distribution
capability, we're looking in offers for an insurance company who has a license, okay. So
that's pretty big.
Then let take the last one, underserved end consumers. Today, we see a huge
opportunity for end consumers. So clients of our clients, who take care of their health,
who are interested in their lifestyle, who want to live longer, who want to live healthier.
And this is the whole concept around that you know our collaboration with Vitality, all these
variables and all these kind of things. And this is a boom. And we have been writing a lot
of VNB in the past out of these initiatives. And we're going to continue to write this. And
with this, I would say, I stop, even it's 6 minutes before my scheduled time. Thank you.

FINAL

Just one question about, I guess, it's recognition under Solvency II. So we had earlier -actually you've seen -- I never know that it's favorable or unfavorable mortality trends in
the U.S. Seen a similar thing in the U.K. I know it's been asked -- we've asked it a few times
in conference calls. But within your Solvency II capital, have you included kind of any
assumption change about U.K. mortality? Or is it up to you when you decide to take that
assumption change?

A - Claude Jacques ChÃ¨vre

{BIO 21916781 <GO>}

Okay. I don't want to say anything, which is wrong. Anybody who can help me on this.
Roland, maybe?

A - Roland Vogel

{BIO 16342285 <GO>}

The one thing we have observed, our experience in new business in contrast to the U.S.
mortality, that's we expected to deviate -- it does deviate positively slightly. But this, as
you know, is not the reasons to change the assumption as such and I don't think that
according to the accounting rules we have -- this has materialized in a fashion longer that
we would be forced to reflect it in (inaudible).

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

And if I may add, we could, of course, reflect is a higher mortality on the U.K. and higher,
they would force on the U.K. longevity business. We haven't done it up to now because
we are not sure that it is -- that this trend will continue or as you also expect in the U.S.
mortality that it will go back to the mortality improvement trends that we have
experienced over so many years. So it is -- we felt it premature to put it in. I mean, for us it
would be fortunate, favorable to put it in because in the U.K., we have a lot more
longevity business than we have mortality business.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Can I just follow-up? At what point I know in the past, you've had discussions with auditors
around when to put things through in the accounts. And is there any kind of similar
process in the Solvency II capital that means that at some point people that are looking at
your Solvency II capital say, "Hang on, you're using what it seem like overly conservative
assumptions to count on your Solvency II capital?"

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

Well basically, Solvency II, of course, is best estimate. It's also best estimate assumptions
for future mortality. But of course, I mean, there are reports on reduced policy
improvement in the U.K.. But that is an experience, which we have seen in a few years,
say, the last couple of years. So trend for the future on that is up to debate. And I think,
there're different views what to expect is the mortality trend for the future. And therefore,
I mean, we have to form an expert opinion on that. And of course, that has been validated
against the facts presented you see and against the opinions that are voiced by other
experts. But of course, there is no clear-cut, unfortunately. I mean, there's no truth in this.
There is probabilities and also the probabilities are quite blurred, I would say. You have no
clear probabilities either on these trends. And maybe, Andreas, you want to add
something to that? But that's the way I see it.

A - Andreas MÃ¤rkert
Just one thing. The Solvency II balance sheet is audited as well. So we also have to
convince the financial auditor for the balance sheet that these assumptions are best
estimate in the sort of allowed range of Solvency II.

FINAL

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

Directionally, it is Solvency II that optimistic assumptions are challenged more than
pessimistic assumptions, I would say.

A - Karl Steinle

{BIO 1986424 <GO>}

Well the next question comes from Edward.

Q - Edward Morris

{BIO 16274236 <GO>}

Same question really for the U.S. mortality, I would say. I mean, you mentioned earlier that
this year, I think, to address over the course of 2018 and maybe might just flow over into
2019. Looking at these charts, you can see that the hit to VNB is quite significant in
Solvency II terms. Have we seen that yet? Or we will see that hit in the Solvency II regime
over the course of 2018?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

Well you have seen it, seen already. In 2018, there should be no additional hit. There
should clearly be an improvement with every rate increase that we are able to achieve or
any recapture that we see as a result of rate increases. Because all of them would
increase the future cash flow adjusted for risk margin and discounted because they would
take -- they would reduce the hit of the currently negative expected cash flow under the
ING portfolio.

A - Karl Steinle

{BIO 1986424 <GO>}

Okay. Any further question -- ah, from Andrew.

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Just a point of clarification. The contribution to recently written new business into EBIT is
much higher than it has been. And you're showing that on your chart.

FINAL

It composed total EBIT with the contribution from recently written new business. I
understand we know the drag from the U.S. you've clarified that earlier. And we talked
about it. I still -- my head seems to, it seems to be implying other parts of the back book
are less profitable than historically as well.

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

You mean, less profitable than expected?

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Well contributing less to EBIT. I know the back book is running down over time. So that
happens. But is there any -- are there any other back books that are a bit below expected
besides U.S., I mean?

A - Claude Jacques ChÃ¨vre

{BIO 21916781 <GO>}

Yes. One of the issues we had was the issue in Australia, which is the DII business. The DII
business is typically a back book, which is underperforming. And we took the hit at that
moment. So we increased reserves by about EUR 100 million, as I told you. And since
then, the book is running as expected. So there is no negative deviation from this or, let's
say, more negative than what we expected. And apart from that, Klaus I'm looking at you,
I'm not aware of any negative back book within our portfolio.

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

So the back book is essentially breakeven. I mean, if you take U.S., the back book is
generating EUR 150 million or something?

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

Well I mean, of course, for 2017, I mean, we will have a negative effect from the ING block,
which is close to EUR 200 million. Of course, it's mitigated a little bit on the mortality
solutions by the new business. So-called organic growth business. And of course, you see
the very high realization of the value of new business and that is the reason that at that
time we increased our expected EBIT from the life and health business from EUR 300
million to EUR 350 million, more than EUR 350 million. If the ING block would have
developed as expected at the beginning of -- at the end of 2016, that would have
happened with quite a bit of margin in it. But you have to say that this is rather, I mean, it's
only taking into account the business from -- the new business from 2012 onward. I mean,
there is some...

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

It kind of assumes you stopped witting new business, isn't it?

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

That's right, yes. And we, of course, would not be writing new business as well.

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

The same question, you shown longevity in your scenario of VNB to cash flow out of 50
years duration. I mean, the average age of a pensioner at retirement life expectancy is 23
years. So I thought most longevity business is written for annuities in payment...

FINAL

A - Claude Jacques ChÃ¨vre

{BIO 21916781 <GO>}

Of course, yes.

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

So you're writing a lot of deferred annuities?

A - Claude Jacques ChÃ¨vre

{BIO 21916781 <GO>}

No. We don't write lot of deferred annuities. We do write some. But very limited ones. But
this is, of course, the extreme scenario and I'm just trying to find this slide.

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

It's the Slide 5.

A - Claude Jacques ChÃ¨vre

{BIO 21916781 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Yes. Exactly, exactly, I'm just coming to this one.

Q - Andrew James Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

That one.

A - Claude Jacques ChÃ¨vre

{BIO 21916781 <GO>}

Yes. This is the one. These are the cash flows we're expecting. But if you take somebody
who is 60 or 65 and takes out the annuity, I mean, the probability that he lives up to 100
or 105 still exists. So we don't have deferred annuities of people who are 20 years old,
yes definitely not. But this definitely is possible. Yes. Some differs for people above 50,
let's say, a 50-year old guy, he can easily live up to 100 and then you get into these
graphs.

A - Karl Steinle

{BIO 1986424 <GO>}

Okay. Another question from Vinit.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Just very basic thing, obviously, cash flow that discounted and how do you think of interest
rate. And I mean, you don't necessarily rely too much on the long and most of your EBIT's
coming from the first 10 years currently. But is that with -- but if risk moves or, I mean,
that's something that how do you -- it shouldn't be a concern right?

A - Claude Jacques ChÃ¨vre

{BIO 21916781 <GO>}

I mean, that interest rate move is simply concern for us?

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

FINAL

Should not be probably because you're trying -- I just want your thoughts on that because
discount rate is one of the most important things in life insurance, generally.

A - Claude Jacques ChÃ¨vre

{BIO 21916781 <GO>}

I mean, of course, there is a discount rate that you use when you calculate by VNBs. So if
the interest rates go down, the VNBs tend to go up. This is what you referred to. And the
other way around, if the interest rates go up, the VNB goes down. But the VNB is simply a
theoretical figure at the end. It's your interest and EBIT that you generate. And I don't
think there is a huge impact on the EBIT that we generate at the end. It's just the VNB,
which is a discounted figure, which is going up and down with the interest rate moves.

A - Karl Steinle

{BIO 1986424 <GO>}

Any further question, ah, from Daniel.

Q - Daniel Bischof

{BIO 17407166 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Just a very simple one, on Page 17. So if you take the 2016 VNB of EUR 893 million. So how
much -- into how much EBIT to it would roughly translate? Is that rule of thumb? Or
anything?

A - Claude Jacques ChÃ¨vre

{BIO 21916781 <GO>}

Yes. We have a rule of thumb. I think, it translates into more or less twice as much EBIT. Uli,
correct me if I'm wrong. But I think it's 1.5x, 2x twice the VNB. So you can double it or, yes, I
think this is the sum of EBIT...

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

Yes. It depends a little bit on the mix of business, we knew we have a very long-duration
business. Of course, the -- I mean, risk margin as well as the discounting is the higher
figure. I mean, on the financial solution
(technical difficulty)
It can be short or maybe only five years-or-so. Of course, it translates less. But in and
large, I think, 1.5x to 2x is probably quite a valid figure.

A - Karl Steinle

{BIO 1986424 <GO>}

Any further questions? Doesn't seem to be the case. Well thank you for the questions.
Without further ado, Ulrich will now summarize the day and take a brief look forward. After
this, I'd like to invite you to join us outside of this room for a snack and drinks. And in doing
so, I certainly would like to thank you for participating today and your lively questions. And

it's -- as I've said, it's really gratifying for us that so many of you came today and showed
such a lively interest. On that note, over to you, Ulrich.

A - Ulrich Wallin

{BIO 4863401 <GO>}

Thank you very much. That brings us to, let's call, the key takeaways. That's what we want
for you to take away. And you can see it's a nice picture that I've taken this one. And the
sun is shining kind of. And blossoms are blooming. Yes, I mean, if you turn to the individual
takeaways, first of all, I mean, Hannover Re is well capitalized, the Solvency II ratio is the
way we look at it, including the operational risk model fully integrated in excess of EUR
250 million. So if opportunities are there and they could be some on the P&C side is a
hardening market, we can increase our risk appetite without running into problems this
year's solvency ratio. Secondly, we have introduced a special dividend into our strategy.
And currently, the expectation is and that's, of course, subject to what happens between
now and year-end. It's also subject to the decision of the AGM as well as the supervisory
board, we would expect to pay a special dividend also for 2017. At least, we have taken
that into account into our internal capital model.
We think that the low interest rate environment is manageable for us, as Roland alluded
to. The ROI should be stabilized at around 2.7% give or take, which would mean that we
could generate this expected positive cash flow of continued value in excess of EUR 1
billion. And returns from assets under management around the EUR 1.1 billion to EUR 1.2
billion mark. On the P&C side, we still have significant redundancy buffers, as Andreas
showed you. They have not been depleted in 2016 despite the fact that it was already the
fourth year into the soft market. 2017, we make it some out of it depending on outcome.
But we see better trading conditions that we expect in 2018. We would think that there is
a good opportunity maybe to add a little bit again in 2018 to those kind of buffers. We
expect growth in Property Casualty, of course, as JÃ¼rgen alluded to on the Advanced
Solutions business. But also on the more traditional business where we see rate
increases, we will grow both bottom and top line. So we look very positive, even though I
have to add cautiously positive into the P&C world into 2018.
On the Life and Health, I think, Claude very clearly showed you the underlying growth of
our EBIT value of new business translating into EBIT. And therefore, whilst we expect that
we will see some negative effects due to the recaptures in 2018, from 2019 on, we should
see growing EBITs from our Life and Health business. On provider year that would
depend that the modeling that we now do is on a more granular basis on our ING block,
actually holds into 2018 and the following years.
With that, we think we can continue to create value for our clients, our shareholders and
our employees. And we feel that we are well positioned to put our new strategy, which I
explained to you into practice for the benefit of all our stakeholders.
With that, that concludes our Investors Day, our 20th Investors Day. And of course, as
Claude mentioned, there are drinks and food outside. And I would thank you for coming.
And when you leave here, safe travels wherever you go to. And all the best. Thank you
very much.
