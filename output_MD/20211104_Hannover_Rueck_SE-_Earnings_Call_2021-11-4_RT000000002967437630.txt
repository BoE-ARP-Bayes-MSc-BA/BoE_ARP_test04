Presentation
Operator
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I welcome you to today's Hannover Re International
Conference Call on the Q3 2021 Financial Results. For your information, this conference is
being recorded. At this time, I would like to hand the call over to your host today, Mr.JeanJacques Henchoz, Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

Well, good morning, everyone and welcome to our conference call presenting the results
of Hannover Re for the first nine months of this year. As usual, I'll start with an overview
before our CFO, Clemens Jungsthofel, goes over the financials in more detail. And then, I
will comment on the outlook for this year and for 2022. For the Q&A, as always, I'm
additionally joined by my Board colleagues, Klaus Miller and Sven Althoff.
In the first nine months of this year, Hannover Re has again proved its resilience in a
challenging market environment in life and health reinsurance. The results continued to be
impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. And in P&C reinsurance, we had to deal with the
elevated large losses from natural catastrophes, most prominently the European floods
and Hurricane Ida in the third quarter.

FINAL

The fact that we still achieved a double-digit return on equity, year-to-date highlights the
strong underlying profitability of the group and our successful volatility management.
Additionally, the group net income of EUR856 million is in line with our full year target
range of EUR1.15 billion to EUR1.25 billion, and hence, we have kept our profit guidance
unchanged.
Gross premium increased by 14.4% adjusted for currency effects. This is mainly driven by
our P&C business group, where we recorded continued strong top line growth on the
back of improving market conditions and increased demand from our clients, although
growth in life and health reinsurance was also ahead of our expectations.
In P&C reinsurance, the large loss impact of more than EUR1 billion was clearly above our
budget for the first nine months. Adjusted for this quarterly budget overrun, the technical
profitability was, however, in line with our expectations.

Bloomberg Transcript

Furthermore, this is supported by our unchanged net estimate of COVID-19 related
losses, which has now been stable since the end of 2020 at EUR950 million. As
mentioned, the ongoing global pandemic continues to have a significant impact in life and
health reinsurance. Within our portfolio, the main markets affected by COVID-related
excess mortality of the U.S., but also South Africa, where Hannover Re has a very strong
market position.
All-in-all, losses connected to COVID-19 amounted to EUR404 million and most notably
the third quarter losses of around EUR140 million, came ahead of our initial expectation.
As already disclosed in Q1, the restructuring within our U.S. mortality portfolio led to a
positive one-off effect of EUR129 million. Additionally, we recorded a positive effect of
EUR99 million from reserve releases in the longevity in Q3, partly mitigating the COVID-19
impact.
At 2.9%, the return on investment is significantly ahead of our expectations, mainly driven
by favorable ordinary income. Our capitalization according to Solvency II continued to be
excellent confirmed by our strong solvency ratio of 239% at the end of the third quarter,
well above our 200% threshold. The main reason for the decrease in the third quarter is
the increase in required capital due to the attractive business growth, including the growth
we expect to see in 2022. This leads to an increase in SCR, whereas the positive impact
on own funds is less immediate due to our conservative assumptions for new business.
Furthermore, large losses in P&C and COVID losses in life and health, had a negative
impact on the solvency ratio year-to-date.
The operating cash flow in the first nine months of 2021 reached a record high of EUR4.2
billion, mainly driven by attractive reinsurance growth as well as very favorable results on
the investment side. The figure for the first quarter included a positive one-off from the
restructuring within our U.S. mortality portfolio of EUR640 million.
Overall, the positive cash flow fueled the strong growth in assets under own
management to an all-time high of about EUR55 billion. This growth was additionally

FINAL

supported by ForEx effects and the issuance of EUR750 million in hybrid capital, already
known in March. This bond issuance is also visible on the next slide, bringing our total
hybrid capital to EUR3 billion. Despite this issuance, we still have material flexibility in
regard to our total hybrid capacity. On the right-hand side, you can see that our strong
profitability is the main reason for the increase in shareholders' equity. And additionally,
the change in OCI was slightly positive, because negative valuation effect were offset by
positive currency translation.
On that note, I'd like to hand over to Clemens, who will explain the figures in more detail.

Clemens Jungsthof el

{BIO 22251357 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you, Jean-Jacques and good morning, everyone. I would dive straight into the
reporting for our business groups and start with P&C. We now look back at all important
renewal dates in 2021. And you can see gross and net premium in P&C reinsurance grew
by a remarkable 18% adjusted for currency effect.

Bloomberg Transcript

The growth is highly diversified with particularly strong momentum in North America, in
Germany, and in Southeast Asia. On top of this, we successfully expanded our structured
reinsurance book, and we also were able to increase the volume of our facultative
reinsurance book. As in previous years, we would expect the growth in gross premium to
slow down somewhat; however, the net premium growth should remain more stable.
As you all know, the impact from large losses was significant in the third quarter of 2021.
For Hannover Re, this resulted in net large losses of EUR1.07 billion for the first nine
months, clearly above our budget of EUR849 million for the first nine months. The net loss
estimate for COVID-19 related losses, however, remained unchanged at EUR950 million.
All together, the combined ratio of 97.9% for the first nine months is very solid, in light of
the observed loss activity and the underlying figures are in line with our targets.
Net investment income in P&C increased based on strong ordinary income, higher
realized gains, and lower impairments. Other income and expenses include negative
currency effects of EUR105 million. In the previous year, we had almost the same amount
as a positive contribution, and I alluded to that already in the second quarter, that it is
mainly an accounting mismatch as we have a similar movement in our equity. All together,
the EBIT increased strongly to EUR161 million, thanks to the improved investment results
and the favorable underwriting result, which had been heavily impacted by COVID losses
in the previous year. Finally, the tax ratio is at normal level.
On the next slide, as mentioned, total net large losses accounted for EUR1.07 billion,
that's EUR221 million above budget. This means that we have already almost reached the
level of EUR1.1 billion budgeted for the full year after the first nine months. Of course, the
year-to-date budget overall is absorbed in the Q3 result, and hence the EUR251 million
budgeted for Q3 -- for Q4, are still available.

On the next slide, looking at our large losses, the two largest events were unsurprisingly
the European floods with a net loss of EUR214 million and Hurricane Ida with EUR306
million net for our account. On top of this, we have seen further increases in the loss
estimates for storm Volker and the Texas freeze on the NatCat side. However, man-made
losses also increased by slightly more than EUR100 million in Q3, almost entirely due to
the riots in South Africa, which are included in the property losses with an amount of
EUR94 million. Altogether, the impact from both NatCat and man-made losses was
significant in Q3, pushing the actual loss experience above the budget for the first nine
months.
The next slide, as usual shows the technical profitability of our P&C portfolio by reporting
line. The picture I'd say very much reflects the large loss situation. I've just explained,
combined ratios for EMEA, affected by the European floods and by the riots in South
Africa, while the Americas include significant losses from Hurricane Ida and the Texas
freeze.

Bloomberg Transcript

The worldwide markets show a rather mixed picture. Facultative and agricultural business
are mainly impacted by large losses in the technical profitability and credit and surety, as
well as in aviation and marine, is really excellent driven by favorable underlying loss
development and positive reserve runoff.
Let's move on to life and health, then on the next slide. The pleasing business growth is
reflected in both the premium and in value of new business. And really, I'd say, comes
from all our four important categories. Growth is actually quite diversified by region as
well. As Jean-Jacques mentioned, the technical result was still affected by losses in
connection with COVID-19. Around 85% of the losses stemmed from two markets, EUR197
million from the U.S. and EUR149 million from South Africa. The losses in South Africa were
particularly significant in the third quarter, whereas the losses from the U.S. were lower
than in previous quarters.
On the positive side, we recorded a positive effect of EUR99 million from reserve
releases for our longevity portfolio. In part to really avoid misunderstandings, I think this
needs some additional explanation. You might be wondering how we can have further
reserve releases when we have locked in assumptions according to address for
accounting and usually, we do not even have to set up reserves for this kind of treaties.
The reason is that we have so-called provisions for adverse developments and as Claude
already explained at our Investors Day, not long ago in recent months, we have received
updated mortality data from our clients, showing that the mortality within our enforce
portfolio has been higher than expected.
Hence, we could release those provisions for adverse developments those had, because
more people in our portfolio have actually died than initially assumed, not because we
assume any different mortality trends for the future.
In other words, the impact does not reflect any general change in assumptions for our
longevity business, which would be uncertain, but only higher mortality in the enforce
book, which of course is completely certain.

FINAL

Furthermore, it is also important to note that the updated mortality data is largely for preCOVID period and not affected by the pandemic.
Finally, as explained in our Q1 conference call, the restructuring of parts of the ING
portfolio in U.S. mortality led to a positive one-off effect affecting various lines items in the
P&L. In total, the positive impact was EUR129 million. The ordinary investment income was
in line with expectations. The fair value of financial instruments decreased materially. The
negative impact was driven by the valuation of derivative embedded in a life reinsurance
contract in the UK. And additionally, the previous year had benefited from positive
valuation gains from an equity participation.
Other income and expenses mainly driven by a further increase in the contribution from
our Financial Solutions business, a large portion of which is recognized according to the
deposit accounting method. Currency effect here in line and has had a rather minor
impact. Altogether, the EBIT of EUR220 million is satisfactory, reflecting the
aforementioned positive and negative extraordinary effects.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the next slide, as usual, a quick look at the non-IFRS metric for business growth in life
and health, the value of new business according to Solvency II. In Q3, we again took
advantage of the attractive opportunities for financial solutions in the U.S., but also in
China and we further expanded our longevity book in the UK. The total value of new
business for the first nine months supports our full year minimum target of EUR250
million. Furthermore, the pipeline currently looks very promising, and I would say we are
well on track in terms of new business production.
On the next slide, the development of our investments. I think it's fair to say that the
development in the first quarter and in the first nine months of the year was very
satisfactory. The ordinary investment income is particularly strong. The main drivers for this
development are the excellent returns from our alternative investment portfolio. Then the
overall asset growth fueled by our very positive cash flow as well as the impact from
increased actual inflation numbers and the associated positive impact on the amortization
of our inflation linked bond.
Realized gains have also increased compared to last year and are mainly the result of
routine portfolio management as well as some strategic -- let's say, as we mentioned the
sale of listed equities in the first quarter, which have contributed EUR50 million to the
realized gains. Impairments and depreciations decreased compared to the previous year,
where we had recorded some impairments in the more volatile market environment. So,
this year's number is more or less at expected low levels to a large extent comprising
regular depreciation on our real estate portfolio.
As explained in my comments on life and health, derivative valuation was negative. So, the
overall return on investment was 2.9% and we expect to achieve a higher return than our
initial full year expectation of roughly 2.4%.
Unrealized gains, as you can see here, decreased by around EUR500 million, mainly due
to the increase in interest rates that are compared to year-end 2020.

FINAL

On the next slide, well known, I think the asset allocation developed in line with our
strategy. The most notable change is the reallocation from government bonds into
corporate bonds. The focus here is on large and small corporates in developed markets.
The contributions to ordinary investments income is diversified as usual. The highlight as
mentioned is probably the recovery in the contribution from private equity to the strong
levels we had seen before the market volatility, caused by the pandemic.
To conclude my remarks, the first nine months and in particularly, the third quarter proved
to be a challenging period for the reinsurance industry, and therefore, the overall result
and the fact that we have confirmed our full year profit guidance for 2021 highlights
Hannover Re's strong ability to manage and absorb volatility.
On that note, I'd hand back to you Jean-Jacques for the comments on the outlook.

Thank you very much, Clemens. On the next slide, the target metrics confirms Clemens'
summary. Most notably, our main profitability target for the group, the return on equity is
well above our minimum target, even though the underwriting results in both P&C and life
and health are impacted by extraordinary losses. This also means that the EBIT growth
targets in P&C and life and health are somewhat distorted by COVID claims. These
targets being more oriented towards normalized growth over the course of the strategic
cycle.
More importantly, growth is significantly ahead of the strategic target, providing a strong
basis for a successful business development in 2022.
So, before we move on to the outlook for next year, let's have a brief look at our
guidance for the year 2021. As mentioned, the profit guidance remains unchanged.
Thinking about the individual components contributing to this number, the premium
growth is stronger than initially expected, and together with a higher return on
investment, this should be sufficient to compensate for higher-than-expected large losses
in P&C and higher-than-expected COVID losses in life and health, which were also partly
offset by positive one-off effect as we've seen.
For the fourth quarter, further impacts from COVID claims is likely in life and health. Even
though the development of the pandemic remains uncertain, the accelerating vaccination
progress in South Africa in particular provides the basis for decreasing excess mortality in
this country. The targeted ordinary dividend according to our new definition as
communicated at our Investors Day is at least the EUR4.5 paid out this year. As before, we
will consider paying a special dividend on top of this if the capitalization exceeds our
capital requirements for future growth and profit targets are achieved. And as of today,
I'd say that both sides of trend are being met.
As usual, at this time of the year, we publish our guidance for the expectations for next
year, as mentioned, growth opportunities are attractive, and we therefore, expect gross
return premium to increase by at least 5%. As in previous years, the growth is likely to be
Page 6 of 22

FINAL

more pronounced in P&C reinsurance. The return on investment should be at least 2.3%,
the 10 basis points being -- decrease being -- versus our initial guidance for this year,
reflecting the low interest rate environment with reinvestment deals below our portfolio
yield.
The group net income is expected to be within the range of EUR1.4 billion to EUR1.5
billion, an underlying improvement of around EUR250 million compared to our guidance
for this year. The main driver for the improvement is the profitable growth in this and
previous years, in particular in P&C reinsurance. And this growth is not only leading to an
improved underwriting result, it has additionally led to a very positive cash flow, which in
turn forms the basis for the favorable growth in assets under own management. And the
increased asset base is expected to more than compensate for the slight reduction in
relative returns.
In life and health, growth is similarly helpful, but the profitability is also expected to
improve. The uncertainty in life and health is somewhat higher due to the future
development of the COVID-19 pandemic. And with this in mind, we have added a
disclaimer to the effect that no material COVID lost is -- are included in the guidance.

Bloomberg Transcript

In addition, we have not included any potential relief from our mortality rate for cover,
which is likely to payout in 2022. So, there is some allowance for COVID claims embedded
in our guidance, but no significant numbers.
Apart from this, the guidance is under the usual provisor the large losses stayed within the
budget in P&C. And the budget has increased to EUR1.3 billion. And of course, also that
there are no major distortions in the capital market. The increased large loss budget is
mainly a reflection of business growth. Last but not least, the dividend policy is the same
as -- for this year. The ordinary dividend announced in March 2022 will be our floor for the
ordinary dividend and we have a potential special dividend on top. Altogether, our
guidance reflects the positive development and successful cycle management of the
group and we're quite positive about the outlook for next year.
This concludes my remarks. And as always, we would be happy to answer your questions.

Hi. Good morning, everyone. Could I just dig in a little bit more to the increased cat
budget for 2022, the EUR1.3 billion. Because you split that between man-made and
NatCat, because I noticed you give that split now, you gave us split for '21. I guess I'm just
curious that the budget is growing 18%, is that a proxy then for your expected NEP growth
or is it growing just funding ahead of NEP growth? I'm just trying to frame when you talk
about it growing in line with business, to what degree it really is just the business volume
versus anything else going on?
My only other question was, on the longevity release, thanks for the additional color. I'm
just trying to judge, would there be like another possibly two years or something, before
we'd have mortality, before you got more information again from cedents to update
again unreleased further PADs. If there's something, it could be that much of a gap
between when you look at it again, because of the nature of the slow information flow
from cedents. Thanks.

A - Jean-Jacques Henchoz

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

Thank you. So, first question, Sven on the NatCat budgeting, and Klaus will address the
longevity release.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Sven Althoff

{BIO 19104724 <GO>}

Yes. With regard to the major loss budget, happy to give you the split man-made versus
NatCat. So, we kept the relative percentage just close to the distribution we had in 2021.
So, it's roughly 80-20 and to be precise, EUR250 million out of the EUR1.3 billion is manmade and EUR1.050 billion is the natural catastrophe. The growth is not a proxy for our
premium growth ambitions for next year. As always, it is the mix between the growth we
have seen already this year and there is a natural time lag translating this into our major
loss budget and the development of the major loss budget, and some of the anticipated
growth we expect for next year.
The bulk of the increase on the NatCat side is growth related. There's only a smaller
portion going to model changes, which we are doing on an annual basis, where we are
validating our current modeling assumptions and given the losses over the last three to
four years, of course, there are always some minor changes even there and some of that
is flowing through into the major loss budget increase for 2022.

A - Klaus Miller

{BIO 16886879 <GO>}

Okay. Now, I'm happy to take the question on the longevity side. The way how it works as
we -- our counterparties are either pension funds or in some cases life and pension
insurer. And especially, the pension funds, how do I say that tactfully, I'm not at the
forefront of modern admin systems and they are not used to do reinsurance accounting.
So, when they take out this reinsurance, it's probably the first and only time they do that
and they have to change their systems to administer that. And that takes usually at least a
year, sometimes two, sometimes even more.
We have grown a lot in the last couple of years and got an awful lot of these (inaudible)
and we did the pricing and when the treaty was concluded, it was also agreed that we get
Page 8 of 22



Company N ame: H annover Rueck SE
Company Ticker: H N R1 GR Equity
Date: 2021-11-04

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

at least annual update. Sometimes we get these, sometimes we didn't, sometimes we
have to ask for it. So, a delay of two years is probably the norm.
And when we get these updates, of course, we get accounts, but we only see the fixed
lag, which is fixed from the outset. We know exactly these numbers. They don't even have
to send it to us. And we see the variable lag, the monthly, quarterly pensions we have to
pay. And as long as we see that, the fixed lag is higher than the variable lag. We know that
the treaty is basically going according to plan. And then, we just book these numbers.
What we get as additional information from the (inaudible) is, are there people who died,
if they are younger in terms of the annual monthly pension, it might be the same as
somebody of aged 60 gets GBP1,000, or of aged 90 gets GBP1,000. So, in the monthly
accounts, you don't see a difference. But if somebody who is 60 dies, and we had a lot of
these claims more than expected, then the impact on the profitability is much higher than
if somebody at the age of 90 dies, because the remaining pension time would be much,
much shorter.
And we try to be assured with these (inaudible) but due to some other work, especially
writing new business or people were not completely up to date with the analysis of the
(inaudible) we received and then we took a major asset last year to start getting this up to
date and again this year. And you can expect this for the future. If we don't update the
(inaudible) and release the PADs as Clemens mentioned earlier, you should expect our
profits are improving from year-to-year in small -- very small set. And then only as soon as
we take the (inaudible) and clean up for the people who have died more than expected.
And obviously, we can release all the provisions for adverse deviations for these dead
people because we definitely don't need it. Then you will see a big profit like you see this
year. This should happen regularly every two or three years.

A - Jean-Jacques Henchoz

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

Yes. Andrew, if I may add, you shouldn't see that as a recurring result (inaudible)

Q - Andrew Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Sure.

A - Jean-Jacques Henchoz

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

-- this year, so it's really, as Klaus mentioned, it's a bit of the cleanup to be honest. So,
there will be an effect in every year going forward, but certainly not to that amount that
we've seen this year.

A - Klaus Miller

{BIO 16886879 <GO>}

But just to make one point clear, this is not a new assumption setting for mortality in the
future. This is cleaning up the portfolio for people who have died. And therefore, clearly,
we don't need to pass any long term.

The next question is from Vinit Malhotra, Mediobanca. Your line is now open. Please go
ahead.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Hey, good morning. Thank you very much. So, a few questions please if I can. First is that,
I'm noticing, I mean, you're talking about Solvency FTR growth, but I can't seem to
recollect that, it was there, for example, similar period last year, might have been, but we
didn't really mention it. The growth was similar. So, I just wanted to know, is there anything
more remarkable in that number? And this is more a quick check really.

Bloomberg Transcript

Second question is on the combined ratios in credit. I think I can back calculate 3Q is about
73%. Now, remember that we keep talking about how the economic recovery and
insolvency in state schemes going away. Is there any reserve movement here or anything
more notable please?
Just one more question on retro please. The bond recovery is very, very high. I mean 240
net growth, 643, I think is one of the very strong recoveries for a single loss. Could you
comment on that? With also some comments please on Texas freeze?
And just lastly, please, the cash flow of EUR1.5 billion is very, very high, very high as far as
me. You mentioned investment income, the roads and the business, but is there anything
more remarkable, for instance, I mean, there would also be payouts to be made on these
EUR1 billion plus of losses. Would that be affecting cash flows in the future as well? So, I
just wanted to understand the cash flow well? Thank you very much.

A - Jean-Jacques Henchoz

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

Thank you, Vinit. So (Technical Difficulty) and cash flow, Clemens will give you status and
credit (Technical Difficulty) and large losses, Sven will comment on this.

A - Clemens Jungsthof el

{BIO 22251357 <GO>}

Yes, Vinit. Good morning. Let's start with the Solvency I. So, it's really as Jean-Jacques
mentioned, the SCR increase, our own funds have largely not moved at all. So, if we
would be looking at, let's say, as stable as the Solvency II ratio would mainly be on the
basis of Q2 of 250 roughly. So, it's really the SCR that increased heavily. It's the usual
exercise that we do in Q3.
First of all, it's a reflection as Jean-Jacques mentioned on the current business growth
that we've seen in this year. But also, regularly in Q3, when we do our planning cycle for
Page 10 of 22



Company N ame: H annover Rueck SE
Company Ticker: H N R1 GR Equity
Date: 2021-11-04

FINAL

the next year, we include in our SCR model, in our internal model, the expected new
business both in P&C and in life and health, in our SCR calculation, and that's the reason
why the -- that's the main driver of the decrease in the Solvency II ratio. Again, it's the
usual exercise, I'm just looking at the Q3 numbers for the last couple of years as we
speak, Vinit, and it's always been the case that we have seen a dip in Q3 actually.
And I would expect with their own funds and looking at our reserving position, et cetera, in
Q4, I would expect that, that number to increase again in Q4. What is probably also worth
mentioning is the slight reallocation in our assets portfolio and our investment more to a
bit more alternative investments, et cetera. I think that has also contributed to an SCR
increase. But again, I think that will -- when we look at our reserving, when we look at our
new business from an own funds perspective, we will be reflecting that in Q4, and then in
the next quarter.

A - Unidentified Speaker
On the cash flow, nothing really significant. I mean, Jean-Jacques mentioned, for example,
the Q1 effects from Voya and, of course, the bond issuance, et cetera, but in Q3, it's really
the business in flow. And I think what is probably worth mentioning here, when it is the fact
that we have seen very low payout ratios when it comes to our plane. I think that's
probably the main driver, that the cash outflows for large losses has been lower than I
would have expected. I hope that answers the questions, Vinit.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Thank you.

A - Sven Althoff

{BIO 19104724 <GO>}

The credit and surety combined ratio, what you are seeing here is the impact of positive
runoff from old underwriting years. We are still reserving the underwriting years at higherthan-average combined ratios due to the uncertainty, that what will happen to the level of
insolvencies once the various economic stimulus packages are phasing out, but the runoff
for the older underwriting years is positive, more positive than expected, given that we
now had a period of one-and-a-half to two years of economic stimulus. So, the short-term
level of insolvencies were below our original assumptions.
And there's a tail on trade credit is not particularly long. So, three to five years, we could
now release some ultimate loss ratios from those prior underwriting years.
When it comes to the burnt loss, you're right, the difference between the gross and the
net is relatively high. This means that we could collect the burnt losses from both our
transactions, but also particularly from other -- our whole account protections, which
explains the difference between the two numbers, Hurricane Ida on the other hand, the
bulk of the difference between gross and net, which you are seeing is actually the
difference coming from the ILS business, which we are fronting. So, EUR180 million out of
that gap is coming from our fronting activities. So, on Ida, we had -- we have booked K
recoveries, but no further excess of lost recoveries to walk our net position. And on the
winter storm in the United States, we unfortunately had another round of negative runoff

in the third quarter, which is due to the very late reporting from ceding companies on that
freeze loss. So, this was a little unexpected, but given the situation with lot adjusting and
capacity for construction in the U.S., the reporting is slower compared to the usual
reporting periods. We are used to, but we are under the assumption now that we should
have seen the full impact of winter storm Uri with this third quarter figures.

The next question is from William Hardcastle, UBS. Your line is now open. Please go
ahead.

Q - William Hardcastle

{BIO 16346311 <GO>}

Hi, morning, everyone. Just a quick follow-up on that. So, essentially on the fronting
business, is what you're saying the difference between the gross and net, obviously on
the floods is bigger versus Ida. Is that because of the greater fronting on European
business? Is that what you're saying?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Klaus Miller

{BIO 16886879 <GO>}

No. Not at all. That's not what I was saying or trying to say at least. When it comes to the
German business, we hardly do any fronting. So, the difference on burnt between gross
and net, is really our own retro sessions. So, the gross number you are seeing is also
almost exclusively our own writing. that situation is different on an Ida. The U.S. portfolio is
the peak portfolio in our fronting activities. So, therefore out of the EUR527 million of
gross, approximately EUR180 million is fronted business, where -- while on burnt, it is
almost zero.

Q - William Hardcastle

{BIO 16346311 <GO>}

Sure. It's quite the opposite of what I was saying. So, effectively your retro is kicking far
stronger in your own account from the floods than has on Ida. Is there anything why that's
happened? Is there a specific reason?

A - Jean-Jacques Henchoz

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

Well, it's a question of market share. Given that our subsidiary for the German business,
the ENS, from a market share perspective, the market leader in the German business. Our
market share in Germany is just much, much higher on the business in general, but also
the NatCat component within the business compared to where we are in the United
States, where our market share on cat-related business is underweight.

Q - William Hardcastle

{BIO 16346311 <GO>}

Okay. Moving to (inaudible) I'll go to my actual questions now. What benefit did the
reinstatement premium have in Q3 for P&C? And is this already factored in when you

Page 12 of 22



Company N ame: H annover Rueck SE
Company Ticker: H N R1 GR Equity

provide the 2022 outlook, to say greater than 5%? And perhaps any quantification of what
that impact is?

FINAL

And the second one is, you've touched on there on the 2022 guidance, no material
COVID-19 impact in life and health. Just for clarity, it sounds like you're not assuming zero,
but certainly less than something like EUR100 million. Is that a very fair assumption?

A - Jean-Jacques Henchoz

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

Yes. On the reinstatement premium, we be -- our immediately booking those
reinstatement premiums when we are booking the losses, so there is no spillover effect
into 2022 from reinstatement premiums. I don't have any precise numbers for you on how
high exactly those reinstatement premiums which we have booked in Q3 were. So, rather
than speculating, I guess we will have to come back to you on that.

A - Unidentified Speaker
On COVID, life and health, William, I think your assumption is right. We have built in some
expectation in our 2022 guidance for COVID related claims. It's not going to be a tripledigit number. It's somewhere a double-digit number I think that we've baked in. On top of
that though, we still have the potential coverage from our retro pandemic cover in life and
health, that will be most likely paid out in 2022. So, that will give us an additional buffer for
the year. But as Jean-Jacques mentioned, it shouldn't -- should not significantly deviate
from those numbers.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - William Hardcastle

{BIO 16346311 <GO>}

And just on that pandemic retro cover, it sounds like you feel very confident that will pay
out now, is that because Q3 losses for excess mortality came in ahead of your
expectation, that it's effectively giving greater certainty that it will kick in. Is that how we
should read that?

A - Jean-Jacques Henchoz

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

Yes. That's absolutely correct. Currently, the ratio stands at about 113% according to our
own calculation. From a formal point of view, there will be a calculation agent who will do
the calculation, as soon as he gets the official statistics for the years 2020 and 2021. So
that will take some time in 2022 before this information is available. But according to our
own calculation, we are getting close to 113% now.

A - Unidentified Speaker
Just for clarity, when the coverage is, it's a parametric trigger and the coverage is U.S.,
Australia, and U.K. So, it's not South Africa.

The next question is from Thomas Fossard, HSBC. Your line is now open. Please go
ahead.

FINAL

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. Couple of questions. The first one would be related to the walk from
the '22 guidance versus 2021. If you could add maybe a bit of color on the underlying
assumptions you have taken? The second quick question will be, regarding COVID
scenario for 2022, I guess that you built something in into your 239% Solvency II ratio
already, given it's forward-looking in terms of calculation. So, would you mind saying
maybe a range of what you're already expecting for 2022?
And so, the last question would be, just to come back on the 2.3% return on investment
guidance for 2022, and especially knowing that you reported 2.9% or 2.8% ordinary
investment income in 2021. I mean, you've got the support from private equity from
inflation linkers, but I'm wondering either 2.3% should be -- if nothing exceptionally is in
the reported nine months 2021, I'm wondering, is the 2.3% should be compared to the
2.4% 2020 guidance or to the 2.8% 2021, and 2.3% seems to be super, super cautious,
given what you achieved this year. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Clemens Jungsthof el

{BIO 22251357 <GO>}

Yes. Thomas, let's probably start with the guidance for 2022. So, overall, I think without
going too much into the details, the core question is, where does the increase in net
income mainly stem from. It's clearly a mix of effect. In the bottom line, first of all, of
course, the significant business growth that we've seen both in P&C -- in life and health
and in P&C, the quality of the book should have increased over the last couple of years.
So, we will certainly increase -- we'll see an increase of profitability and in P&C here and
there. And of course, the overall amount of the growth will be reflected in higher EBIT
numbers in P&C. On the life and health book, as mentioned earlier, the expectation is that
we will see significant less COVID-19 claims in the life and health segment. So, the
underlying profitability of the business should come through in 2022. That will be another
large contributor.
On the investment side, I think, yes, when you look at the numbers, they do seem very
cautious for 2022. We are optimistic that we will at least reach that number, the 2.3%, but
I'm just conscious of the fact, of course, that we've seen sort of a rebound in the
contribution from alternative investment, that amount has been significant. I think roughly
EUR100 million of our ordinary income is only related to an increase compared to last year
of the contribution of alternative investments, mainly private equity. So, I wouldn't really
factor that in going forward for every year. I think that did come a bit as a surprise for me,
to be honest, also the valuations on the private equity side, which have increased
significantly. So, I wouldn't really want to expect that amount for 2022.
Inflation-linked bonds, the same picture there. We have seen a huge contribution,
probably EUR100 million more this year as well, compared to last year, given the current
inflation environment and the way the amortization of our inflation-linked bonds work. So,

Page 14 of 22

Date: 2021-11-04

FINAL

there are two -- at least two effects in the ordinary already, that we will see to some
extent in next year, but we have been a bit more cautious on that end.
On Solvency II, if I got the question right, Thomas, but please add. So, how much from the
SCR increase would we attribute to our growth in 2022? I don't have the exact number.
But I think overall, it's certainly on the Solvency II ratio, probably a double digit -- low
double-digit number, or a high single-digit, a low double-digit number that is attributable
to that effect. But again --

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Yes. I think, Clemens, I was more thinking about the prospective COVID-19 mortality
losses that you are expecting to incur in 2022, which may already be reflected into your
Solvency II ratio at Q3.

A - Clemens Jungsthof el

{BIO 22251357 <GO>}

Yes. No, that is not -- I don't think that is included in the SCR and in the own funds yet. We
will do an update of that planning and the effect I think in the fourth quarter, but it's not
reflected. But it wouldn't be in a substantial amount as mentioned earlier anyways.

The next question is from Iain Pearce, Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Please go
ahead.

Q - Iain Pearce

{BIO 19522835 <GO>}

Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one is just on the growth numbers. When we
look at the impact on the Solvency II ratio and the increase in the cat budget, the
implication is probably that growth is going to be significantly ahead of 5% especially in
P&C rates. So firstly, do you think that's a fair assumption?
And then secondly, is there anything in terms of life and health growth that you're thinking
is going to be lower, that's leading you to maintain that 5% growth target? The second
one was just a quick clarification, the life retro kicks in, is it a 100% excess of normal
mortality that the trigger for that parametric cover?
And then, the third one was just on longevity releases and the potential for these going
forward. Sort of -- you sort of cautioned us against factoring in too much here, but if you
think -- if I thinking in sort of your key longevity markets, mortality has been trending
Page 15 of 22



Company N ame: H annover Rueck SE
Company Ticker: H N R1 GR Equity
Date: 2021-11-04

favorably consistently over the last couple of years before we even factor in any impacts
from COVID. Why should we not be thinking that these are going to be some -- there's
going to be continued favorable longevity development?

FINAL

A - Jean-Jacques Henchoz

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

Thank you. So, Klaus, maybe you can address the life and health point and the growth in
P&C, Sven you can add there again.

A - Klaus Miller

{BIO 16886879 <GO>}

Okay. Let's start with the growth on the life and health side. We are quite optimistic that
we are growing, but most of that will be -- and this is where our focus is on the bottom
line, it's not on the top line. Top line happened every now and then, and you have to
understand there are basically three ways to grow the top line here.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the -- either we really write new large blocks of business, that will increase top line or
most of our treaties on the mortality side -- morbidity side are via treaties, and as these
treaties get older, that mortality rates, morbidity rates grow exponentially. So, the risk
premium grows, even if nothing happens, even if no new policies are added, these
treaties grow for the existing portfolio, because we have risk premiums, which are
growing.
Of course, at some point in time, this goes the other way, because in 50 years all these
treaties have runoff. But as long as they are still young, 10, 15, sorry -- 10, 15 years old.
These treaties are growing. And then, of course, we have treaties, which are open for
new business, and this is another source of growth. So, in general, we expect to reach the
5% maybe a little bit more, but this mainly depends on large block transactions, especially
on one of our focus areas. And that is longevity.
Then your question on the retro, yes, it kicks in at 110% population mortality. And that is
the, as mentioned earlier by Clemens, it's a weighted average of the U.S., UK, and
Australian population mortality, weighted with the portfolio of Hannover Re.
So, we try to get the correlation between this parametric cover and the results in our own
portfolio as high as possible. So, we tried to optimize that by using our own portfolio
structure to define the parametric cover. And as I said earlier, it's currently stands close to
113%, according to our own calculations.
And then, the longevity release, yes, we are, when we started 15, 20 years ago, we have
longevity and nobody else was doing that. We embarked on a pretty conservative way of
accounting for that. So, in the first couple of years and this is still valid today, we only show
about 2% to 3% profit in terms of an EBIT margin. And if the portfolio develops as
expected, we would see and you've seen that now a release of these PADs especially
when we do these cleanup of portfolio. With COVID, especially in the U.K., we got the -U.K. is the largest market, we had a lot of claims and most of these claims have not been
accounted for fully, because the release you have seen probably only includes the
updated portfolio information 12 months ago. So, an awful lot of COVID is still not in there.

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

On P&C growth, Sven, do you want to add?

A - Sven Althoff

{BIO 19104724 <GO>}

Yes. As I said earlier, the increase in the major loss budget is not a good proxy for our
expected growth in net earned premium on the P&C side next year. From a process point
of view, we are fixing the major loss budget in the autumn of the previous year, so like we
are doing now. So, the EUR1.3 billion is fixed for 2022. Same, of course, goes for the EUR1.1
billion we fixed for 2021. And we -- when we were fixing it at the time, we did not expect a
premium growth of about 14% after three quarters on the P&C side, but we were more
expecting a growth in the 5% to 7.5% range. So, a good part of the increase in the major
loss budget is explained by catching up with the actual growth, which we have achieved in
2021, plus then the expected growth for 2022.
As Jean-Jacques said for 2022, we are expecting a more pronounced growth than the 5%
on the P&C side. But you should think more along the lines of the mid-term average I
gave you during the Investors Day, i.e., the at least 7% number I gave you a few weeks
ago, rather than the 14% after three quarters. By the way, the growth number will come
slightly back more to what the 10% growth number on the P&C side on the -- for the full
year. The reason why the growth rate in the third quarter was particularly high, reset on
our biggest structured contract, we have increased our share. So, there was a significant
premium entry booked in the third quarter. But under that contract, we every year too
have the appropriate premium distribution on an earned basis and written basis, there will
be a significant number of premium booked out in the fourth quarter in 2022 on that
particular contract. And that's why the final number for P&C will be closer to the 10%
rather than staying at the 14.5%, where we are after three quarters.

11 percentage points since the end of July. Could you tell us how many Solvency II points

the 4Q 2022 as well or -- sorry, is it capturing the next 12 months or the entire 2022?

Page 17 of 22



Company N ame: H annover Rueck SE

And then lastly, do you have a comparable figure for last year, because if I look at the
Solvency II decline in 3Q 2020 relative to 1H '20, it's much less pronounced. So, yes, could
you give us a comparable figure if possible? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Clemens Jungsthof el

{BIO 22251357 <GO>}

Yes. On Solvency II, it's actually the business growth that we've seen in 2021, that is
reflected. So, we've updated our model for the current business growth, which has been
significant so far and also it includes the full 12 months of 2022. So, that's really the usual
planning cycle that we complete in Q3, and then we include that in our SCR calculation for
the full year 2022, so that's the new business both in P&C and in life and health. So that
increases -- and then, of course, the higher capacities here and there in P&C and life and
health. So that's the main driver.
I don't have the exact number, but it's going to be a double-digit number, which has been
offset by some other effects, but I think it's about a double-digit number here. And again,
another contributor was, of course, the asset risk due to our slightly changed asset
allocation and the increase in alternative investments as mentioned earlier. That was
another contributor.

again.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you for the opportunity. Sorry to ask again, but on the life side, I mean, I'm just
curious about a few things please.
One is that, if I just start with the operated -- the reported EBIT of EUR41 million, and add
back COVID mortality data, the longevity is at EUR83 million. And then somewhere from
the presentation, I picked up that financials -- the deposit accounting was also EUR95
million. So, ex deposit accounting, we actually have a loss of about EUR12 million. And I've
been made aware that there are some derivatives which went up against in the financial -in the financial statement. I mean, is there anything that you could comment on this
surprisingly negative result on the life side, please? That's really my question.
And second question is, on this cover on the pandemic, I think there was a conversation
also in the 2Q results, where it was mentioned that the cover wasn't being activated yet,
because of Australian mortality trends, if I recollect. Has that changed? Or is there some
update on that, that makes you think that next year you could choose this cover?

And last follow-up is on getting a question from (inaudible) is there any idea to break out
this burned between (inaudible) and the whole account, please? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Clemens Jungsthof el

{BIO 22251357 <GO>}

Okay. The first question was the EBIT. I fully understand that you do a little bit of, let's say,
recalculation, take a few things out and add others back in, but the COVID reporting of
COVID claims is, let's say, at least very delayed, if not completely unreliable. So, making
calculations especially on the quarterly basis, what the usual number would be, it's quite
difficult. We don't get correct information from all our clients, and we definitely don't get it
in time. So, adding or subtracting COVID claims from, let's say, audited claims numbers is
-- it's a nice intellectual exercise, but I would not necessarily rely on the outcome here.
I can't see that we have a negative -- of course, we have a negative results if you look at
the COVID claims on mortality side, it's highly negative, but we have a very stable financial
solutions result. What you have seen in the other result here is the 351, of which 278 is
deposit accounting treaties and they are completely unaffected by COVID. We also have
very positive longevity result, plus even if you ignore the one-off of nearly EUR100 million,
which is also only slightly positive impacted by COVID. And the EUR400 million COVID
claims, of course, drag it down, but the underlying profitability is extremely high and
stable. The great unknown for us is how the next COVID variant will develop in '22. And
nobody can tell you anything about that.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jean-Jacques Henchoz

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

Vinit, to briefly add probably, it just brings to my mind, what is the driver, and which might
explain what you have observed is in part what Klaus mentioned the profitability of the
underlying business, but has probably been a bit more pronounced in the first and the
second quarter and less in the third quarter. But then on top of that, I think the investment
result on the life and health side is less pronounced than on the P&C side, that's mainly
attributable to the fact that alternative investments are mainly sitting within our P&C book.
And also, the contribution from inflation linker is mainly P&C. And then, we have the
mentioned derivative in the U.K. results and that is -- that was a deviation in the third
quarter of roughly EUR10 million. So overall, that should round up the picture probably.

A - Clemens Jungsthof el

{BIO 22251357 <GO>}

But definitely the COVID -- the reported COVID claims, not necessarily booked claims,
but as COVID -- or the identified COVID claims have reporting lag of four to six weeks
and even then they are not necessarily reliable, because an awful lot of people,
everybody who gets into a hospital, gets tested on COVID, and if it's positive, even if that
has nothing to do with the fact that, he just had a car accident and if he dies, he will be
reported as a COVID claim in many countries. That doesn't happen. So I don't really rely
on this analysis. Definitely not on a quarterly basis. And then, could you just repeat your
question on the retro whether we have included that already in 2021?

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

As the life pandemic cover was already running at a higher and I think at 2Q, you had said
that you were not yet counting it in or factoring it because of Australian mortality claims.
Page 19 of 22

Maybe I'm misunderstanding the whole thing. But maybe -- yes.

FINAL

A - Clemens Jungsthof el

{BIO 22251357 <GO>}

The cover is for all three countries in total. So, it's a parametric cover and this stands at
100 and close to 113 right now. If nobody dies for the rest of the year, this will fall below
the 110 and we don't get anything. It's unlikely that we don't even see normal mortality. So,
I expect definitely something in -- for this year, but it will only be calculated next year,
because the calculation agent relies on official statistics and official statistics, population
statistics for 2021 will only be available sometime in 2022. And sometimes it's not January
or February or anything like that, well the second half of the year. These are civil servants
who produce that.
And the calculation agent will only start calculating the final recuperation for us here, as
soon as he has all the official statistics from the U.S., from Australia, from the U.K.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

could be also this late supporting, Klaus, that you mentioned?

A - Unidentified Speaker
Sorry --

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

I think the effect in Q3, the overall effect in Q3 was EUR140 million, EUR70 million to
EUR80 million stemming out of South Africa. So that was the bulk. And I think, it's probably
a bit higher number than you assume for the U.S. actually, but that was as expected, Klaus,
wasn't it in life and health in the U.S.

partial loss against our whole account cover. I would not be comfortable to give you the
precise split for the simple reason that the loss happened in the quarter.

So therefore, we have not received enough information yet to book each and every
element of the loss on the bottom-up basis. So, there are still some top-down
assumptions included in our gross number for burned. And depending on how that will fall
in the end on individual contracts, the split between K and whole account is subject to
change. So, whatever (inaudible) split, I would give you today, would be subject to that
change. So therefore, I would feel uncomfortable to giving you very precise numbers. But
as I said, you should think about burned as a substantial partial loss against our whole

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Yes. Two quick questions. The first one would be on the life reside, this longevity PAD. I
guess it was included in your EUR600 million EBIT contribution initially targeted for 2023
and that you move to 2024, but just wanted to -- I guess it was included at the time of the
Investor Day. But just wanted to update on that, just to be fully aligned and fully clear. And
the second question would be on the P&C side or P&C NatCat. What's your overall
assessment of the profitability of your book? Maybe you could share with us the year-todate combined ratio or the return on allocated capital you're getting on this book despite
running ahead of budget? Thank you.

A - Clemens Jungsthof el

{BIO 22251357 <GO>}

Yes. Thomas, this is indeed taking into account the longevity and benefits also that -that's including the EUR600 million.

A - Klaus Miller

{BIO 16886879 <GO>}

And on the NatCat, so as Jean-Jacques explained in the Q&A, during the Investors Day, of
the NatCat portfolio is modeling well against our profitability hurdle rate. So, from pricing
point of view, the last two rounds of rate increases certainly helped to get that portfolio to
a better level of profitability. We expect further rate increases on the loss impacted
business into 2022. So, from that point of view, we are okay with our profitability on the
NatCat side, but at the same time, as we already mentioned on the Investors Day, we will
keep our relative risk appetite for NatCat stable nonetheless. We are not seeing rates
yet, which would make us fundamentally change our risk appetite.
On the result point of view, I'm afraid, I don't have those numbers for you. The NatCat is
not a separate segment we are reporting upon, as you know, for few quarters now. So, I
would not be able to give you those numbers, but Claude can get back to you on those.

Thank you. Thank you.

And there are no further questions at this point. So, I hand back to the speakers for
closing remarks.

A - Jean-Jacques Henchoz

{BIO 17457677 <GO>}

Well, thank you very much for joining, and thank you for the great questions. I think we
covered the ground very well. You've seen a year impacted by large losses on both
business segments that numbers demonstrating resilience, net income improved, the
ROE above 10%. And I think the key message is that the profit guidance has been
confirmed for this year with a positive outlook for 2022. The guidance for '22 shows both
the growth trajectory of the company and the improved quality of the book. So, I think the
key messages were addressed today. Thank you very much for all the questions and see
you next time.
