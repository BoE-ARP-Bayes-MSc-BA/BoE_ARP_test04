MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning or good afternoon. Welcome to Swiss Re's First Half 2018 Results
Conference Call. Please note that today's conference call is being recorded.
At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Christian Mumenthaler, the Group
CEO. Please go ahead.

Christian Mumenthaler

{BIO 6479864 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Good morning and good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to
our first half 2018 results conference call. I'm here with John Dacey, our Group CFO, and
Edi Schmid, our Group Chief Underwriting Officer, and Philippe Brahin, our Head of
Investor Relations.
Let me start with a few brief remarks on the results we published this morning. The group
delivered a solid set of results in the first half of 2018 with the group net income of $1

billion. We saw material improvement in earning quality with strong underwriting
performance. As in Q1, our results are impacted by U.S. GAAP accounting changes.
Excluding this impact, our group net income would have matched last year's first half
results.
We also report growth in the first half as premiums increased by 8% particularly driven by
our Life & Health business and Corporate Solutions, which is operating in a moderately
improving market environment. In terms of our P&C Re renewals, volume is up 9% and
price quality improved 2% year-to-date.
Finally, and as you will have seen, we're also exploring a potential IPO of our UK closed
book business ReAssure in 2019. We believe that the UK closed book market offers
significant opportunities and remains a growth area for Swiss Re. However, the business is
subject to significant asset risk charges under the SST capital regime. Given the size of
future potential opportunities, it is important for ReAssure to have access to substantial
new capital. We expect to remain a significant investor in ReAssure in the context of a
potential IPO.
With that, I'll hand over to our Head of Investor Relations, Philippe Brahin, who will
introduce to Q&A session.

Many thanks, Christian, and good day also for my side to all of you. Before we turn to the
Q&A. I just would like to remind you to please restrict yourself to two questions each and
reregistered for follow-up questions.
So with that, operator, could we please take the first question?

Q&A
Operator
The first question is from Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous. Please go ahead.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Hi, there. The first question, thanks for the disclosure on slide 23 on Corporate Solutions. I
guess I'm just curious would you not have expected the attritional underlying loss ratio to
have improved given better pricing. Maybe clarify what's going on there? Would you
expect that to improve in the second half ? Is it that we haven't seen any earn through yet
of the re-underwriting or the better pricing? That's the first question.
Second question, just to clarify on ReAssure, I'm assuming – sorry, this is a question of
mechanics, in order to free up your need to consolidate the capital requirement, you'd be
looking to end up less than 50%, you have to actually deconsolidate it, is that the aim?
Thanks.

Thanks, Andrew. Why don't we start with Edi on slide 23 and maybe John on the ReAssure
question?

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

FINAL

Sure.

A - Edouard Schmid

{BIO 18942809 <GO>}

Yeah, thanks, Andrew, for the question on Cor So. Yes, it's true the underlying combined
ratio or the loss ratio on attritional is a little bit up. A few man-made losses contributing to
that. And the main reason, I think you already stated it, has to do with the time lag. Of
course, we started to improve the portfolio pruning some of the underperforming
businesses quite a while ago, but with the time lag on renewables and the time lag on
earnings. This always takes one to two years until this comes through on a U.S. GAAP
earnings basis. I think that's really all to say about that. But over time as we announced
Cor So is operating in a moderately improving market. It could achieve some growth
through the Prime Lead (sic) [Primary Lead] (00:04:17) initiative, but we still keep
improving the quality particularly on U.S. liability as they have explained in the past from
large corporate segments where we still see a need to drive prices further up. So we
continue to drive it up, but it will take a bit of time until everything earns through into a
better combined ratio.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

What the return rate change is in the first half (00:04:43) earned?

A - Edouard Schmid

{BIO 18942809 <GO>}

No, we set the target of 5%, we are working towards that target. We're not quite there
yet, so we still have more work to do. That's how I would describe it.

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

Thanks, Edi. John on to...

A - John Robert Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

With respect to ReAssure – Andrew, it's John Dacey – yes, you're right. To deconsolidate,
we at least have to go down to 49% in terms of ownership. The other important
dimension will be to give up direct management control of this into the – and independent
board of directors will be put in place where the company management would be
reporting to that board.

A - Philippe Brahin

The next question is from Paris Hadjiantonis from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Paris Hadjiantonis

{BIO 19703051 <GO>}

Hi from my side as well. First question again on ReAssure. I think you are saying that
capital is one of the big issues for you in exploring further acquisitions. Can we interpret
that you are actually looking to raise substantial capital loss part of the IPO and then get
diluted a bit or do you look to basically actually sell part of the business during the IPO
process and therefore get proceeds on it?
The second question will be on P&C Re casualty, motor seems – especially in the U.S.
seems to be a place where there's been authorized development and it's also a place
that will have seen adverse development in the past and also you have been saying that
prices have been going up. When do you think we're going to see some improvement in
motor U.S. business? Thank you.

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

Thanks, Paris. Maybe John, on the first question.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - John Robert Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

On the first one, Paris, if I can just be sure that we're all clear when you talk about capital
needed for acquisitions that's within the ReAssure business, acquisitions of closed life
blocks requires additional capital in the UK market for the execution of ReAssure's
business that's what we're speaking about. And yes, that's true. We obviously committed
from the group real capital when we did the Guardian transaction a few years ago, some
smaller deals with HSBC and most recently last year with Legal & General where most of
the equity capital was provided by MS&AD as they came in for a 15% shareholding in the
ReAssure business.
On a going forward basis, we undoubtedly see that there is a pipeline of potential
opportunities for the absence of doubt ReAssure is open for business and we'll continue
pursuing those opportunities while we prepare simultaneously for the IPO to be ready in
2019. It's premature to suggest the nature of the IPO whether it will be entirely secondary
or a dimension of primary that would depend on what happens with those opportunities
for the business in the UK market in 2019 or even the second half of 2018.
But for now, again, the objective of this transaction is in the first case to provide another
source of capital for the continuation of this business and the potential growth of this
business that would not necessarily be on Swiss Re's balance sheet.

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

Edi, on U.S. casualty.

Company N ame: Swiss Re AG

Date: 2018-08-03

Question on U.S. casualty, I think, was more specifically on U.S. motor. I think as you
correctly pointed out, motor has been quite a drag for the whole industry. The whole
industry underestimated motor loss ratios a couple of years ago, various factors
contributing to that. But I would say both actually on the direct side as well on the
Reinsurance side now for two (00:08:37), we have seen significant corrections. Original
rates picking up and also reinsurance terms, commissions, we could improve. We continue
to see improvements on U.S. motor. And I think this has to continue for the longer. I think
particularly in focus is the U.S. commercial motor market, which has been even under
more pressure where we have also seen some, let's say, large verdicts, though we clearly
see a need to further improve pricing there. But I think there is traction in the market both
original and on the reinsurance side. But as commented earlier on the course of question,
it takes a bit of time, until these improvements really earns through under U.S. GAAP as
well.

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

All right. Thanks, Paris, for your questions. Next question please?

Operator
The next question is from Edward Morris from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Edward Morris

{BIO 16274236 <GO>}

Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Two questions, please. First, just coming back to ReAssure
again. Just wondered if you could talk to the rationale behind why you're considering an
IPO and whether this is the only real outcome now? Has it been a consideration to also
look at more minority or potentially majority investors as in sort of trade sale type
scenario? And secondly just looking at the growth in the open book, it would appear from
your slide on slide 11 that the open book seems to have written double in Life Capital,
double the premium in the first half that it did in the entirety of last year. So, clearly growth
is coming through extremely strongly there. Is that indicative of an ongoing run rate and
how close are we in terms of the business turning a profit, should we expect where is the
profit contribution from the open books?

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

Great. Thanks, Ed. Maybe Christian, on the first one; and then John, on the second one.

A - Christian Mumenthaler

{BIO 6479864 <GO>}

Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Thanks. So it's funny, right, but you go through the years and you can
see investor appetite shift from BU to BU and come back added again. ReAssure has
really been the unloved child for quite some while. We obviously worked hard on it, but I
remember two years ago everybody was saying sell it, and I said this would be a huge
waste of shareholder funds because you would dump it to somebody who have a very,
very small – pay a very small price.
It's actually an interesting business. I really think there's an investor base that would really
love it and I actually – I personally would love it if I didn't have the SST and the risk factors
Page 5 of 18



FINAL

Company N ame: Swiss Re AG
Company Ticker: SREN SW Equity
Date: 2018-08-03

in SST and in our own risk model which we say it just creates a too high concentration in
asset risk for the Swiss Re Group overall. And if you look where we have grown, clearly
ReAssure has been more interested in unit-linked product, in mortality product with
profits. I think we struggle more than others when we look at annuities for example. And
yet if you look into the business, the small deals have gone. There's still some small deals
around, but some of the big ones will come eventually. So if you think about all of that, it's
quite clear to me and I think has been clear to this community for the last two years that
Swiss Re, it's a great business, but Swiss Re is not the best holder of this business
economically. I think, to me, this is crystal clear. And so the question is more what's the
path towards this end stage which creates the highest amount of shareholder value. And
we have discussed that internally obviously in great length, in great detail going through
all the scenarios.

Bloomberg Transcript

And our view is that the first step was to bring in a good shareholder who shows the value
of the business, and that we have done with a client of ours who's a client of ours for
more than 100 years. And obviously you could start to have now number 2, 3, 4 in, but
their relative value for our shareholders shrinks because we have already one who sets
the value. And at this stage looking at the comparables in the market, the overall market
situation, I think, is a relatively good time window which might close before we are there,
but it's a good time window to create significant shareholder value in my view through an
IPO.
Now, we are driven by creating shareholder value. So if anybody jumps in with a huge
offer or whatever, we will always consider that and see whether that's a better path. But
at this stage, since we need to have preparations and there's leakage risk, we wanted to
be upfront investors, announce it today and start working on it more or less immediately.
There's no real pressure or anything, we're not a desperate seller if there's issues with
Brexit, if there's any issue that would prevent us from creating maximum value for
shareholders, we simply keep it, right, at that sign. But I think there's an interesting
opportunity at this stage. That's our own assessment.

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

Thanks, Christian. John, on the open book?

A - John Robert Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

On the open book growth, it's two observations. One, yes, there is a strong growth in
both the iptiQ and the elipsLife businesses, which are part of Life Capital. This was
probably given an extra boost in iptiQ EMEA by one large medex transaction that was
booked, is unlikely to recur, so we won't see that level of growth. And lastly, there is a
positive impact in these numbers from an internal group retrocession of the came
through. It's part of our capital management policies across the group, but it flatters the
actual growth rate. So I think it'd be wrong to extrapolate this in a sort of geometric
fashion, but the growth is strong and we are very optimistic about the opportunities for
the open books in Life Capital.

The next question is from Kamran Hossain from RBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Hi, everyone. Three questions. First on P&C and I guess exposure on wind season.
There're comments say this morning talking about most of hurricanes in one year being a
decade's event rather than hundreds of years' event. Can I assume on that basis that your
retro program has changed ahead of well – I guess now that in wind season, any
comments on that? And the second question just looking at Life & Health, I guess taking
seasonal claims, are you sure this is just a blip and any comments or assurance around
that? Thank you.

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

Thanks. Edi, you take them both.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Edouard Schmid

{BIO 18942809 <GO>}

So, on P&C Re and retro into this season, we didn't make any material change to our retro
policy. As we explained, we actually like the nat cat business a lot. We understand it. We
can demonstrate. We cost it accurately over time. We see lost levels emerging as we cost
for them and as long as we can well diversify the risk, we want to keep it on our balance
sheet. So, what we have in place for the upcoming hurricane season is similar to what we
had last year.
Apparently, last year, it was a unique year because we didn't have one or two very large
serious events, but you had three medium-sized hurricanes, plus a few smaller ones and
that explains why our recovery was lower than you would have expected. Well, actually, we
did make some changes on the Corporate Solutions side, where in the past we were
running quite large net (00:16:29) retentions also for nat cat because our thinking was this
is still part of the group balance sheet. But obviously in comparison to commercial peers,
the losses looked a bit out of proportion.
Into this year, we have strengthened the IGR, the internal power around Corporate
Solutions with a bit lower attachment point and in particular we also have a negative cover
in place. So, Cor So would be much less affected by another series of events. But from a
total perspective, what we see out of the group balance sheet, it's pretty much in line
with what we had in place last year.

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

And the follow-up question, Edi, on the Life & Health mortality claims, the seasonal effect
we saw in H1?

A - Edouard Schmid

{BIO 18942809 <GO>}

Company N ame: Swiss Re AG

FINAL

Yeah. It's correct. Mortality experience was adverse in the first half year and we have seen
an increased frequency of claims, which is seasonal. Flu is a contributor to that, but we
also had (00:17:33) rich number of severe claims. I mean that's the natural volatility in the
mortality book. On the global basis, we can well absorb this and more importantly we
don't see any material adverse development around U.S. mortality that would change our
overall view how we approach this business.

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

Perfect. Thanks, Kamran, for your questions. Next question please.

The next question is from William Hawkins from KBW. Please go ahead.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hello. Thanks for taking my questions. In the P&C business, I've been hearing from many
players about a softening of momentum for renewal rates increases. You've actually
shown 104% price adequacy compared with 103% in January. So is all of this just down to
sort of mix effect in your book and sort of more technical things or is Swiss Re believing it
is more optimistic on the direction of renewals than I guess I've been hearing from the
market in general?
And then secondly, this large internal reinsurance contract between Life Re and Life
Capital that's boosted the premiums. Has that had an impact on capital and earnings
allocation between the two entities? And if so, how much? Or is it just purely something
that boosts the top line of Life Re, but is irrelevant to earnings and capital? Thank you.

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

So, maybe Edi, on the first one; and then John, on the IGR.

A - Edouard Schmid

{BIO 18942809 <GO>}

On the first one, the P&C Re quality, let's say what we wrote at mid-year versus year-todate, this is largely explained by the composition of the business that we knew in the
middle of the year, it's a bit more property and U.S. focused than (00:19:13) where is bit
more European and casualty focused. I wouldn't say we are more bullish than other
players in the market. Clearly we are also disappointed by, let's say, the rather moderate
reaction to the large nat cat losses in 2017. But what pleases us that we could drive
through quality improvements in our portfolio actually in various segments, and at the
same time, we could grow the P&C Re business. Obviously, improvements were a bit
stronger in loss affected accounts, but also in other portfolios we could drive some quality
improvements. The momentum is not as huge, so I would not (00:19:51) competitive out
there, but at least there is, I would describe it, a change in tide also in terms of pressure
on terms and conditions. This has eased quite a bit. So my outlook is more positive. But
clearly, it stays competitive and we need to do more work.

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

With respect to the IGR, again this has been driven by our attempts to have capital
efficiency at the subsidiary levels and across the group. There's been no material impact, I
think, on the relative earnings of the different businesses. If you want a little more detail
on those IGRs in the longer presentation, note for the half year 2018 report gives you
some details for the flows.

Operator
The next question is from Sami Taipalus from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So, first one is on P&C Re and large losses. I note that
there was no sort of man-made losses that made it above your limit in the half, but if you
could just comment on whether there was something below – significant amount of losses
below that limit that would have affected the results in the half year, that'll be great. And
then the second question is just tiding up a couple of things on ReAssure and the first one
is if you were to sell down, would that have any impact on your capital planning because it
kind of sounds like you're probably not going to have to plan for as much potential of
M&A in the future and will that increase your capital flexibility centrally, and also related to
that, it wasn't quite clear to me what was going to happen to the debt that's in ReAssure
at the moment, so if you could just clarify that? Thank you.

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

Thanks, Sami. So maybe, Edi, on the first one; and John, on the second.

A - Edouard Schmid

{BIO 18942809 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks for the question on P&C large losses. As you correctly stated, we have
nothing to report above the $20 million threshold. There are a few smaller large losses,
but overall it's fair that the man-made large loss experience is a bit below expectations,
but maybe a bit surprising is that on the Cor So side, we report a very large claim, $51
billion from this engineering loss in Colombia, $51 billion, and we don't show anything on
that loss on the Reinsurance side. Also in Reinsurance, there is a little bit, but is below this
$20 million, and unlike in other situations, we generally see it as I explained before rather
little retrocession outside. But as it happens that we offer significant capacity sometimes
both on the Cor So direct side as well as behind some (00:22:51), we can have significant
shares on large senior risk policies or on large construction policies. And for that situation,
we actually have a per-risk cover in place to avoid, let's say, out-of-proportion
accumulation of large senior risks. And in this engineering loss in Colombia, actually
Page 9 of 18



Company N ame: Swiss Re AG
Company Ticker: SREN SW Equity
Date: 2018-08-03

external cover was triggered and that explains why we only show this $51 million in Cor So,
that's the retention after IGR, but we don't show anything on the Reinsurance because a
large part of this loss actually is ceded externally.

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

FINAL

Great, John?

A - John Robert Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

And with respect on the potential ReAssure IPO, yeah, we find ourselves in the position
where we're selling down our stake from the current 85% to something that's 49% or
potentially even slightly below 49% and in the meantime the pipeline has not resulted in
any additional transactions. You should expect that that would free up additional capital.
We're pretty far away from that moment. We've got a lot of preparation to do. And as we
said, we hope to be ready to execute in 2019. When we get closer to that, we can, I think,
have – reengage on what that might actually mean for capital.

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

And there was also a point on debt. Maybe you want to comment on the...?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - John Robert Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

Yeah. So, we in 2016 issued a debt. It was a replacement of some bank financing that had
been in place for ReAssure. It's at the level above ReAssure business, so it would not –
the holding company where the debt was issued would not be part of the transaction. We
would, I think, look as we would approach the IPO, what would be the appropriate level of
debt and equity for the entity which goes out into the market. In the meantime, we've
stated explicitly in the press release today that should Swiss Re Group no longer be the
majority owner of this business, we will be sure to indemnify the bondholders.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Yes, good afternoon. Sorry to come back to ReAssure. Just a very simple point from my
side. What is the overarching reason for (00:25:27) doing this now? So it's not like SST has
changed some rules or it's not like, is the pipeline that you had imagined before, and
apologize, you did clarify that, we've been thinking about two years, but in the meanwhile
you also got the new investor, so obviously just curious as to what is that trigger for
(00:25:49)? And just on the Life Re, are you able to quantify a little bit this slow season
impact (00:26:02) you said a bit more frequency came in, but if you could just quantify
something? Thank you.

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks. Maybe, so, John, on the first one; and then Edi.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - John Robert Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

Vinit, I think part of the issue frankly has been the success of ReAssure in recent years,
and capturing the Guardian transaction which was relatively large, the HSBC, and most
recently Legal & General. We see the opportunity in this business for continued
accumulation of assets underneath the ReAssure business model. And the challenge for
us is the relative size of those assets to the rest of the group has gotten relatively large.
There's, if you will, a finite amount of asset risk that we would be comfortable with, I think,
over time. We not at that point today, but at some point in the future especially if
ReAssure engages in some of the larger transactions that we see are potentially out
there in the UK market, this could become a constraint for us. And we'd rather build today
the operational freedom for the business to continue to grow, to continue to transact.
And doing that outside of the SST framework, I think, is good not only for that business,
but potentially for the remaining businesses inside Swiss Re Group who benefit from a
reasonable level of asset risk in running their operations. Christian, I don't know?

A - Christian Mumenthaler

{BIO 6479864 <GO>}

Yeah. I think a bit to add to that, right, it's not something we have decided a week ago
and we just do it, right? These things need the right level of strategic thinking, consensus
building and then the time. So when I took over two years ago relatively clear we created
consensus around the overall direction and we started to implement it. And this is just the
next logical step in that point. So maybe comes as a surprise to you, but hopefully there
were enough signals that would make this less of a surprise. I think there's a complete
logic in our communication over the last two years if you go back in the past we intend to
take. And so, this is just the next step.

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

Yeah. On the adverse mortality experience in the first half, I think there's not much more I
can say. As I mentioned previously, party is clearly seasonal, so we don't expect that to
repeat. Flu is a factor. The other component, I mentioned, is an average number of

severe claims that is random. There is nothing to do with seasonality, so it could occur at
any point in time. But the key point I would repeat from before we don't see anything
material systematically that would make us to believe we have to change our view on U.S.
mortality rates.

Thanks, Vinit, for your questions. Can we have the next question, please?

The next question is from Stefan Schürmann, Bank Vontobel. Please go ahead.

Q - Stef an Schürmann
Yes. Good afternoon, and just two questions. First, coming back to, I think, the open book
growth. Can you maybe just quantify how much basically this growth eats into your Life
Capital earnings? I think it was quite substantial and that cost you some upfront obviously
acquisition cost. And the second one on prior year developments, you showed 1.5
percentage points in that. How much was related to basically HIM claims last year, so the
hurricane claims you reserved for last year? There was any positive development here I
guess.

Okay. Start with John on the open book.

A - John Robert Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

So the open books, elipsLife is a little more mature business than iptiQ which is obviously
effectively a tech-enabled startup within the group. These are both primary life companies
and precisely because they are able to capture the fast growth that you see in the
premium line, it will be some time for a breakeven of iptiQ in particular. elipsLife, I think, is
there, but the contribution to earnings is modest and we continue to expand that
business in new geographies. As we expand the business in new geographies, we're
going to have to invest in those new geographies, so I don't think you should expect the
open businesses of Life Capital to have any material impact turnings in the near to midterm as long as we see that investing continues to grow value for us, we will think
potentially as the IPO of ReAssure approaches for being able to provide more
information on value of new business or some other metric, which would give you a better
sense of how we see the value creation in the open book businesses.

Yes, Stefan, on your question regarding the 1.5% favorable prior year development in P&C
Re, actually from HIM, we only had very moderate releases. We think we are adequately

reserved for the big hurricanes. Actually there was some adverse development this time
for property overall, but that is mainly driven by some losses out of Japan. There was
another typhoon in 2017, name of Lan, and there were some late reporting on this event
and that explains the negative prior year development on property for once. But overall,
as we say, it's positive, so both casualty overall, but also special lines continue to deliver
positive prior year development. That's the whole picture.

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Good afternoon. First on the ReAssure, again, Christian, you say it's an attractive
segment, but you're not the best owner. I mean what we do know is that it's a low ROE
segment and given management is paid for ROE, I wonder why you think it's so attractive
and why you shouldn't sell down closer to zero rather than staying at the 14.5% mark
you're indicating today. That's my first question. What keeps you from selling down really
close to zero? Second question, investment income stripping out the $265 million from
mark-to-market tough, you have that $40 million realized gains in H1 compared very low to
the previous year. So the question is why is it abrupt change on realized gains in sort of
the $40 million you see in H1, the normal run rate?

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

All right. Maybe we'll start with Christian.

A - Christian Mumenthaler

{BIO 6479864 <GO>}

Yeah. So, yeah, I have to qualify attractive, right? By attractive, I mean there is tons of
people knocking on our door who would love to have a piece of that, who find this
attractive, right? There's a lot of people, there's PE funds, there's all kinds of people in
the market who find that attractive. There's a shareholder who are interested in a high
dividend yield, they find it very attractive. You can see the other big company who does
that in the UK, Phoenix and their valuation, and so from all of that, it's clear that this type
of business is attractive for a whole set of shareholders and not necessarily for Swiss Re,
you're right. So I can definitely see shareholders for whom this will be very attractive
business including the growth prospects and all of that.
Swiss Re, once we go down, once we don't own it, deconsolidated and now all of that,
right, then other aspects of the business are attractive. The cash profile, for example, is
attractive. The cash IRR is attractive. The dividend capability (00:34:25) is attractive. So at
this stage, we certainly would like to stay a shareholder of this, but on a much smaller
share, on the share that is not consolidated and doesn't create the SST-type issues, right?
You also look at it differently from an SST perspective once you have a smaller share. So it

Page 13 of 18



Company N ame: Swiss Re AG
Company Ticker: SREN SW Equity

really looks different once you're a smaller shareholder, and to stay in and as the people
we know, the business we trust, all of that to me makes sense.

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

FINAL

John, maybe on the realized gains?

A - John Robert Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

On the realized gain, Thomas, you're right that even if adjust for the change in the U.S.
GAAP guidance, you get a return on investment of 3%, that compares to 3.5% a year ago
for the first half of 2017. I don't think it's correct to assume that the $40 million or the 10
basis points above the running yield is the new normal for our investment portfolio. I think
the asset management team took a look at where markets were, where the portfolio was
and we felt that that was an appropriate set of actions in the first half of this year. I will say
overall with rising interest rates on the fixed income portfolio, obviously the unrealized
gains are shrinking. But I think it's pretty clear that we would have the opportunity both in
some parts of the equity portfolio, the private equity portfolio, the real estate portfolio as
well as this fixed income that if the asset management team felt it would be appropriate
time to harvest some of those gains that they would be doing. So I would not plug $40
million in your model as the new normal.

Thanks, Thomas, for your questions. Can we have the next question, please?

Operator
The next question is from Frank Kopfinger from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.

Q - Frank Kopfinger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon, everybody. I have two questions on ReAssure. My first question is
on site constraints for a potential IPO. Could you comment on first whether MS&AD would
be willing to do the IPO if the valuation would be below their level? And secondly, can you
touch also on the reaction from the regulators which you've got so far and certainly
whether the IPO itself depends on a deal and so this would the site constraints? My
second question is, on a standalone basis for ReAssure, can you quantify the cash and
debt capacity that ReAssure as a platform has as of now, so to do further deals without
IPO, whether the company is already at the limit?

A - Edouard Schmid

{BIO 18942809 <GO>}

So let me see if I've understood the questions correctly. The first one, the time constraint
if that was your question, we...

Q - Frank Kopfinger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

No, it's – not more on this, I called it site constraints and...

That is...

Q - Frank Kopfinger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes.

A - John Robert Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

No, look, we've obviously spoken with MS&AD in advance of this announcement. They are
supportive of this action. We'll see as we progress how we move this forward. But I don't
think there's either contractually certainly not nor operationally a floor that we have to
worry about in terms of pricing for the deal. We will not bring this to market if we don't
think it's in the interest of all shareholders including MS&AD. But that doesn't necessarily
mean that we've got a hard hurdle that needs to clear. I will say also since MS&AD made
the initial investment, we've announced the Legal & General transaction. We've paid out
$1.1 billion dividend to all shareholders, 15% of which went to MS&AD. The business
continues to move forward, and while its U.S. GAAP returns on equity look pretty meager
under the statutory accounts and IFRS, we see a much more positive result.

Bloomberg Transcript

So I think we don't feel see as though we have our hands tied. We also don't feel as
though we've got any absolute need to do this. We are not at the limit of transactions. We
are open for business as I said before and can go ahead and transact should a interesting
opportunity arrive in the market, so we've explicitly told the management of ReAssure
that they should not reduce their activities vis-à-vis new business.

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

John, there was also a question regarding the reaction of regulators.

A - John Robert Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

Regulators, we've informed the UK regulators as well as the regulators here in
Switzerland, I'd say the response was neutral with no particular concerns raised to us, but
a strong desire for us to keep them informed of progress.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Yes, good afternoon. Two questions on my side. The first one for Edi. Maybe to come
back again on the renewals because looking at slide 21 and looking at the strong increase
in casualty, it seems to me that casualty is going up 16% year-on-year. So can you give us a
bit additional granularity on what is driving that, and especially because I find it a bit
Page 15 of 18

FINAL

difficult to reconcile with the charts you're showing on the Corporate Solutions side where
you're showing that the actually the U.S. general liability (00:40:46) has decreased by 21%
in terms of writing over two years. So I know that we are comparing apple to pears, but I
mean it seems to be very, I would say, differentiated underlying trend. So if you can help
us to reconcile what's going on?
And the second question would be again on ReAssure. So clearly this has been over time
very big generator of cash for the group, dividend as well and you paid $1.1 billion in Q2
and actually it's been managed for cash more than for earnings over the past year. So I
mean, in terms of cash generation and obviously this is not the only cash generative
engine you've got within the group, but I mean with this IPO, this will be, I mean, a
significant decline in the cash generation within the group. So how we should think about it
going forward and how are you going to replace somewhat what is going to be lost, we
see, with the IPO process? Thank you.

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

Edi, on the first one?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Edouard Schmid

{BIO 18942809 <GO>}

Yeah. The first one is regarding, let's say, the portfolio composition and it's correct on the
P&C Reinsurance side, the casualty share has increased if you look at first half 2018 versus
2017. This comes to quite extent from Asia and also to some extent from transactions
where we had some successes that explains this increased share in casualty. As we
explained in previous calls and the meetings, we remain quite selective on U.S. liability
overall. And so, this is a segment where we still see need for significant improvement. We
could achieve some in 11 (00:42:36), but clearly that's an area where we stay quite
selective. And versus the different picture in Corporate Solutions, actually, yes, you've
seen we grew the Corporate Solutions business quite a bit, first half year 18% and that
comes from a number of sources first obviously is the bearing some fruits of the Primary
Lead initiative and if you look at lines of business, it is quite spread some in engineering,
aviation, the Bradesco joint venture in Brazil is also starting to bring some additional
volume.
And again, also in Corporate Solutions, as we said enough for quite a while we are very
selective on U.S. general liability where we have pruned the portfolio quite a bit in large
corporate risks, taking down capacity and also premium significantly and this segment
continues to be underwritten very selectively. On the other hand, we had some growth
also in the U.S. on employee stop loss business, and then other segment where we could
grow in Corporate Solutions is around financial and professional lines, particularly with an
MGA (00:43:49) which is running very successfully, which explains also some growth that
is showing up on that U.S. casualty.
But clearly, we remain selective. We grow into pools where we see the profitability
meeting our hurdles, and we continue to drive improvements, we're willing to take away
capacity where we see terms and conditions and price not at the level we like it. But the
main reason is obviously there's always some transactions that tend to impact this

Page 16 of 18

portfolio composition quite a bit from one year to the other. So, it's not so easy to fully
explain.

A - Philippe Brahin

{BIO 19081619 <GO>}

FINAL

Thank you, Edi. John, on the ReAssure cash generation post IPO.

A - John Robert Dacey

{BIO 4437051 <GO>}

Yeah, look, I think you're right, the Life Capital and specifically ReAssure has been a big
provider of cash and dividends. On slide 11 of the deck, you'll see that that's been
particularly true for the last two years, but important in previous years but in some ways
our view is that were we to sell our share down, obviously that would simultaneously bring
cash into the group and at the same time reduce the amount of equity capital that we've
got tied up, there are currently $6 billion in Life Capital that would be a smaller number
absent a vastly expanding pie.

Bloomberg Transcript

What we do with that capital, I think, is something we can discuss in the future when we're
closer to an actual IPO. But at the moment, our capital management remains intact is what
we've said in the past. We need the capital to, in the first case, run the businesses we
have; in the second case, to defend the ordinary dividend; in the third case, to look to
expand the existing businesses and if there are opportunities in the open books of Life
Capital or in Cor So to continue to build scale, we're happy to do that so long as it's value
creating for all shareholders. And finally if we can't do any of those well, then we
repatriate capital to shareholders and I think our track record on this is strong and
transparent.
