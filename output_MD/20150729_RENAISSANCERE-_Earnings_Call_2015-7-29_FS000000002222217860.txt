Before we begin, I'm obliged to caution that today's discussion may contain forwardlooking statements. And actual results may differ materially from those discussed.
Additional information regarding the factors shaping these outcomes can be found in
RenaissanceRe's SEC filings, to which we direct you.

FINAL

With us to discuss today's results are Kevin O'Donnell, President and Chief Executive
Officer; and Jeff Kelly, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin?

Kevin J. O'Donnell
Thanks, Peter, and good morning, everyone. I'll open the call with an overview of our
performance. And then I'll turn it over to Jeff to go over the financial results. And I'll come
back on to talk more the business and the state of the market.

Bloomberg Transcript

Last night, we reported operating income of $100 million and an operating ROE of 9.1%
for the second quarter. Our results were adversely impacted by U.S. cat losses and markto-market losses on our investment portfolio from rising interest rates. Jeff will walk us
through the second quarter results in greater detail shortly.
In general, we executed well in the second quarter, achieving good combined ratios in
each of our segments in spite of tough market conditions. Specifically, we're pleased with
our strong growth in both Lloyd's and Specialty and with the property cat segment's
relatively flat premium for the quarter compared to the 10% down we expected at the
June 1 renewal.
I continue to be pleased with the Platinum integration and believe we're continuing to see
the benefits of our hard work. The combined entity is proving to be greater than the sum
of its parts and has provided us with new and better opportunities throughout the greater
organization. We're presenting a larger, better-capitalized, higher-rated and more
cohesive face to the market, while at the same time that M&A activity is injecting
widespread uncertainty.
This has created opportunities to access business that weren't available previously and, in
my mind, confirms the original thesis behind the acquisition. I'm happy to report that S&P
raised the financial strength rating on Renaissance Reinsurance U.S., which is the
rebranded Platinum Underwriters Reinsurance entity, to A+ from A-.
While we saw increased pricing pressure at the important June 1 Florida renewal, this was
accompanied by a significant increase in demand. Once again, we demonstrated
leadership by cutting back on business that did not meet our return hurdles, while adding
attractive new business by being a first call market leveraging relationships with our four
clients.
At this point, let me turn the call over to Jeff to discuss the financial results. Jeff ?

FINAL

Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'll cover our results for the second quarter
and year-to-date and then give you an update to our 2015 top line forecast. We had a
profitable second quarter with each of our segments generating solid underwriting
results. As the Platinum acquisition closed on March 2, this is the first quarter in which
Platinum's results are fully reflected in our financials.
Catastrophe losses during the quarter were higher than in recent years relating mostly to
wind and hailstorms in Texas. Our results include approximately $8 million of Platinum
integration related expenses in the quarter, which we do not expect to recur in 2016. We
reported net income of $73 million or $1.59 per diluted share and operating income of
$100 million or $2.18 per diluted share for the second quarter. As Kevin mentioned, the
annualized operating ROE was 9.1% and our tangible book value per share, including
change in accumulated dividends, increased by 1.9%. On a year-to-date basis, the
operating ROE was 11% and growth in tangible book value, including change in
accumulated dividends, was 1.4%.
Before touching on the segment results, I'll give you a brief update on the Platinum
integration. As Kevin mentioned, our market-facing personnel are very much operating as
one company. While some important operational systems and processes remain to be
fully converted, those activities are proceeding faster than we originally anticipated. On
the first quarter call, I indicated that we expected to realize a total of approximately $38
million in one-time compensation related expenses. At this point, that number still seems
about right. As for annual run rate synergies, in May, I said that we expected to exceed
our original $30 million target slightly. At this point, we believe that annual run rate
operating cost synergies will be approximately $37 million. The increase in our expected
run rate synergies relates to greater than expected head count savings and to the
cumulative effect of a number of relatively small variances. At this point, I would estimate
that over 75% of those synergies have been realized. All-in-all, we continue to be very
pleased with the acquisition and our integration to this point.
Turning to the segment results, in our Cat segment, managed cat gross premiums were
essentially flat compared with the year ago in the second quarter. Recall that the top line
includes to some extent the renewal of Platinum's cat book for the quarter. There were
no material reinstatement premium adjustments in either period. We had a relatively
healthy Florida renewal with new demand and growth on some contracts offsetting
declines on others and moderate price reductions.
For the first six months, managed cat gross premiums written declined 7.7%, reflecting
softening market conditions. This compares with our full year guidance for a decline of
10%. As a reminder, managed cat includes the business written on our wholly-owned
balance sheets, as well as cat premium written by joint ventures DaVinci, Top Layer Re,
and Upsilon.
Ceded premiums in our Cat segment were down from a year ago both for the quarter
and year, reflecting our decision not to renew the Florida-specific retro program that we
had put in place last year. The second quarter combined ratio for the Cat unit was 59.5%.

FINAL

While catastrophe losses were moderate overall, there was an uptick relative to the
extremely low levels they've been trending at in recent years. Net favorable reserve
development totaled $12 million for the Cat unit in the quarter, mostly reflecting modest
adjustments to a number of small events.
In our Specialty segment, gross premiums written increased by $108 million, primarily
reflecting the inclusion of Platinum specialty and casualty business. Year-to-date, Specialty
Reinsurance premiums increased 38% from a year ago. This compares with our guidance
of a 50% increase for the year.
Our Specialty platforms are well-positioned. We have integrated Platinum's balance sheet
into ours and aligned our Bermuda and U.S.-based platforms to best meet our clients'
needs in a capital-efficient manner. The Specialty Reinsurance combined ratio for the
second quarter came in at a profitable 85.5%. Loss trends were generally benign and
favorable reserve development totaled $18 million for the quarter. For the first six months,
the segment generated a combined ratio of 82.5%.

Bloomberg Transcript

In our Lloyd's segment, we generated $117 million of premiums in the second quarter, an
increase of 62% compared with the year ago period. For the first six months of the year,
gross premiums written grew 59%. As we managed on our – as I mentioned on our last
quarterly call – the segment has gained greater traction, mainly benefiting from the
investments in infrastructure and talent that we've made in recent years. Our premium
guidance for this segment was for growth of 50%.
Ceded premiums in our Lloyd's operation also increased significantly from a year ago as
we commenced a ceded quota share transaction for our casualty business late last year.
The Lloyd's unit came in at a combined ratio of 90.4% for the second quarter, also
benefiting from generally low loss activity. Favorable reserve development totaled $3
million.
Operating expenses were roughly flat compared with a year ago, but commission
expenses were higher.
Turning to investments, we reported net investment income of $39 million in the second
quarter. Recurring investment income totaled $34 million for the second quarter. The
increase relative to recent quarters primarily reflects the higher invested assets acquired
in the Platinum transaction as well as the reallocation of Platinum's fixed maturity
investments to match ours. Our alternative investment portfolio generated a gain of $6
million in the second quarter, driven by generally healthy returns on our private equity
portfolio.
The annualized total return on the overall investment portfolio was 0.5%. The sharp
increase in interest rates during the quarter resulted in $27 million of realized and
unrealized losses, although we benefited from the relatively short duration of our fixed
maturity investments.

FINAL

Our investment portfolio remains conservatively positioned, primarily on fixed maturity
investments, with a high degree of liquidity and modest credit exposure. The duration of
our investment portfolio remained relatively short at 2.3 years and has remained roughly
flat over the course of the year. The yield to maturity on fixed income and short-term
investments remained flat at 1.7%.
Turning to capital, we continue to believe we have capital in excess of our requirements
given our current portfolio and our business outlook. We have largely completed the
process of realigning the capital of the balance sheets that we acquired, received the
requisite approvals to upstream excess amounts to the holding company, and have now
replenished capital and liquidity at the holding company to levels we maintained prior to
the Platinum acquisition.
The rating agencies have also completed their reviews and, in some instances, rerated
certain of our balance sheets. We're pleased with the outcome of this activity and now
feel we have substantial flexibility around capital management going forward.

Bloomberg Transcript

Share repurchases were however modest in the second quarter. We bought back 83,000
shares for $8.4 million. Since the end of the second quarter, we repurchased an additional
$7 million worth of shares. As we look forward, any decision relating to share repurchases
will continue to depend on our view of business opportunities, the profile of our risk
portfolio, and the valuation of our stock.
Finally, let me turn to update our top line forecast for 2015. While our 2015 guidance
includes Platinum, it should be gauged against RenaissanceRe's standalone 2014 gross
premiums written as we view the operations as combined. For managed cat, there isn't
much premium that remains to be renewed in the second half. So, I would say that it
would be reasonable to expect this portion of the business to be down about 7% for the
full year.
In Specialty Reinsurance, we're maintaining our guidance for premiums to be up
approximately 50% with growth to a large extent reflecting the inclusion of Platinum's
business. In our Lloyd's unit, we're maintaining our guidance of up 50%. Recall that any
premiums renewed by Platinum prior to the close on March 2 do not appear in our gross
written premiums for this year. Obviously, that will change in the first quarter of next year.
Finally, I'd remind everyone that premium estimates of this nature are subject to
considerable risk and uncertainty. And our goal in providing them to you is to give our
estimates at this time.
Kevin, I'll turn the call back over to you.

Kevin J. O'Donnell
Thanks, Jeff. Once again, we faced a competitive market during the Florida renewals.
While demand was up appreciably, there continued to be ample capacity to more than

Page 5 of 23



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2015-07-29

meet this demand, leading to price decreases, although to a lesser extent than in prior
years.

FINAL

This increased demand in Florida was driven by several factors. First, the cat fund
accessed the private market for the first time in its history purchasing $1 billion in limit.
While we typically do not comment on individual deals, our participation on the cat fund
program is a matter of public record.
We believe the cat fund purchase was a responsible move by the state of Florida as it not
only serves to protect taxpayers from assessment risk. It also protects policyholders by
increasing the overall stability of the system. Due to our deep understanding of both
Florida market dynamics and hurricane risk borne over two decades of being a leading
Florida reinsurer, we were uniquely placed to appreciate the nuances of the cat fund
purchase and bring our gross to net strategy to bear.

Bloomberg Transcript

Second, the private market in Florida continues to take policies from the state-running
insurer, Citizens Property Insurance (sic) Corporation. Florida-only insurance companies
tend to be proportionally larger purchasers of reinsurance. So, the migration of risk from
the public to the private sector positively impacted demand. Even as it shed business,
Citizens continued to increase the size of its risk transfer program.
With regard to supply, we continue to see capital that is interested in deploying into the
reinsurance market. We believe that most investors recognize the returns are currently
low, but are willing to engage with proven asset managers to begin to better understand
the space and position themselves, should the market improve. Overall, we were able to
construct an efficient property portfolio. And, as I mentioned earlier, rather than being
down as expected, we ended the quarter essentially flat.
We went into the renewal fully anticipating that we would shrink our portfolio and, in many
cases, did reduce our participation on individual programs that no longer met our return
hurdles. By some measures, Florida is no longer as attractive relative to other markets as
it once was. We recognized this early in the cycle and built our Atlantic hurricane portfolio
accordingly adding more nationwide coverage with Florida exposure prior to the June July
renewal, while reducing our exposure to some Florida-only business after renewal.
On balance, we believe by reducing in the Florida-only market and pivoting towards
nationwide coverage with Florida exposure, we're able to build a higher returning
portfolio than otherwise possible. We saw some positive signals during the Florida
renewal that reinsurers were beginning to show discipline. For example, some of the
more aggressively-priced programs resulted in shortfalls that were only filled when price
decreases were brought in line with the market overall.
Further evidence of increased price discipline is the cat fund prices have corrected around
30% this year. However, even with this correction, we continue to see many deals
providing inadequate returns for the risk. I should note that we still expect a challenging
renewal at 1/1, as the dynamics at 6/1 do not necessarily translate forward to January 1.

FINAL

Finally, the ceded retro market had less appetite for Florida risk than in prior years. While
this is a good sign overall, we ended up buying less and, a result, our net exposures are a
little higher than last year. In fact, as we're now a larger company and having assumed the
Platinum re-exposures, both our gross and net exposure in Atlantic hurricane is up yearover-year and on an absolute basis. We're pleased with our portfolio and feel good about
the decisions we made in structuring our risk portfolio for this wind season.
Moving onto our casualty and specialty business. The second quarter represents the
biggest and largest renewal period of the year for the U.S. casualty and professional lines
business. Overall, we were able to retain virtually all of the Platinum casualty business that
renewed during the quarter and believe we have set the groundwork for continuing to
build this business up over the next several years.
As a combined entity and now with a better rating, we're developing a reputation as a
lead in more lines of business and believe we are increasingly a first call market for clients
and brokers across the casualty space. Our approach has been to be the best partner for
our customers, whether it'd be in terms of consistency, willingness to pay claims or by
being good partners providing collaborative solutions.

Bloomberg Transcript

I'm happy with the progress our Lloyd's operation has made and continuing and even
steepening its growth trajectory. Recent growth there has been healthy, which we view as
the culmination of years of hard work spent building a market-leading underwriting
platform, allowing us to effectively leverage both our local relationships and our core
clients. In addition, our Lloyd's syndicate works closely with the legacy Platinum business,
allowing it to access many more opportunities than previously available.
Our ventures team continues to perform well. We're happy with our capital managed
business as currently constituted. And while only accepting new capital on a very limited
and selective basis, we continue to speak with interested new investors in the space. We
executed a $150 million debt offering for DaVinci. And we're adding risk to the DaVinci
portfolio as we renew the Platinum Underwriters Bermuda cat lines onto our balance
sheets. We also continue to evaluate strategic investments but are being selective in
allocating capital to these opportunities.
Before turning to questions, I would offer a few closing comments. I continue to be very
happy to be in the business of reinsurance. As reinsurers, we stand at the confluence of
two very powerful industry currents. The first is the continued growth of risk in the world
and the second is the desire of capital seeking this risk. We continue to be market leaders
in matching desirable risk with efficient capital, which we believe is the recipe for longterm success.
I believe that we continue to have a great franchise in this market. We have the ability to
access both desirable risk and appropriate capital for that risk. We continue to bring value
to our customers by being the best underwriter and providing them with strong ratings
and access to great underwriters. We also continue to bring value to our investors by
providing them with great risk access and, more importantly, greater risk understanding
and assessment, while always standing alongside them on any risk they take.

FINAL

There has been a significant amount of consolidation in our industry, which I believe is
healthy. Consolidation improves both operating and capital leverage and should continue
to drive M&A activity. Overall, I'm pleased with both our position in the industry and the
performance of our business. I'm optimistic about our future and believe we will continue
to see an expanding array of opportunities. As we head into hurricane season, we're
prepared for any eventuality. And if something does happen, we will be there for our
clients just as we have been there in the past.
And, with that, I'd like to open the call up to questions. Thanks.

Q&A
Operator
Your first question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs. Your line
is open.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Sure. Thanks. Just quick numbers question. The expense ratio in the Specialty segment
look like it was down a decent amount compared to the first quarter. Was there
something in there or how should we be looking at that on a year-to-date basis or can you
just give me some context on that, please? Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Yeah. Sure, Mike. I think the answer to that question is largely the operating leverage in
the business and applying more premium to the overhead in that segment.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Sure. But the acquisition expenses were also lower. So, I mean, there's the kind of split
between the two, so I am guessing those are more sort of variable? So just to give you
some numbers, $21.8 million in the first quarter on acquisition down to $18.2 million, I mean
that was running about $24 million last year for the full year. So I'm just trying to
understand kind of what happened actually to have an impact on the consolidated
numbers? I can come back to that if that's – or if you think you guys can answer it later.

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Yeah. Let me have a look at the data.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Yeah. Okay. No problem. And then, I wanted to just ask about the buybacks. I mean is the
idea that – because it seemed like the areas where you're growing maybe shouldn't be
incrementally capital intensive from a diversification standpoint. Is there an operational
reason that you guys have sort of chosen to keep a lid on buybacks here recently or kind
of what's the thought process there?

FINAL

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks for the question. I anticipate there might be more than one in that regard. I'd
say, admittedly, we probably perhaps took a conservative approach as we went through
the close of the Platinum acquisition. But, recall, we did deploy about $600 million of cash
out of the holding company into the Platinum deal. And we anticipated that it would take
us roughly through June to rebalance and restructure the market-facing balance sheets,
get the regulatory approvals we needed to get the excess capital up to holdings, issue
the debt that we issued in the second quarter. And, as I said, as a result of that, I think
we're in a solid position. So, I think we have a lot of flexibility at this point. And I would
expect to – other things being equal – I'd expect to see us in the market going forward.
But, again, as I think we said the last time, I wouldn't expect us to see in the market during
the next several months, but probably to a more significant extent in the fourth quarter
than the third quarter.
The only other thing I'd just say is, as we frequently try and convey, is we don't look at
share repurchases as having to occur on any specific timetable. We look to repurchase
shares at the most attractive levels that we can, and over the last 12 months, we've
deployed a lot of capital into the business, including $500 million or so in repurchases last
year, and, again, the $600 million in cash. So, I think, we took a conservative but reasoned
approach to rebuilding our position over the last three months. And we waited till that's
done. And I think now we're in a good position to move forward.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

All right. Great. Thanks for the answer. I guess and then just one question on – I mean, you
didn't have any reported cats that met your threshold, but sounds like you had some loss
activity. Is this like a normal cat quarter, like weather quarter or heavy weather quarter,
light weather quarter? Like if you're kind of taking it all in one bucket, how does this
quarter stack up for you guys?

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

I would characterize that from a cat perspective as a little higher than normal. And there
were principally two things that – two buckets of things that kind of pushed that beyond
the norm. The first was some windstorms and hailstorms in Texas. There were a number
of events in the second quarter, but about three of them contributed to about $24 million
in net negative impact for the company. It affected about – total about $40 million in net
losses – but the net negative impact at the holding company was about $24 million.
So that was probably a little larger than normal. And then there was a small amount of
developments from some of the winter storms in the first quarter. As those storms are –
with the frequency of them, I think, that it's kind of hard to determine losses, in which
event – and there's some movement there. But that wasn't a big number. But, overall, I'd
describe it as just a little bit higher than normal.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Okay.

FINAL

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Yeah. One thing I'd add to that. I think – in a soft market, I think, it's a good thing to focus
on because it's transparent to think about what price reductions are coming through. But
it's more difficult to see if terms and conditions are expanding. And what I would say is,
the losses that we saw over the course of the quarter are normal losses coming from
normal coverage. We have seen some expansion of terms coming through on programs,
but we've been disciplined in looking at those and making sure that we understand the
extensions of coverage and price for it.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Okay. I guess, I'm just trying to figure out like 9% ROE this quarter – I mean is that how we
should be thinking about now as our first quarter of Platinum in numbers? Just sort of
given the opportunities you're seeing, is this kind of like of a normal-ish quarter and this is
kind of where you guys would expect to sort of target ROEs that you can hit? I mean – or
is this – do you expect that over time that you can generate in a normal environment in
excess of ROEs at this level?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
So, I think, thinking about what's going on in the reinsurance market, if we start at kind of
40,000-feet, there is a secular shift in the market which we've been talking about for a
while. We've seen more capital interested in this space. And we've seen – and we believe
that risk will trade differently. It will enter and exit the value chain at different points over
time. But kind of dropping down to 10,000 feet, we still think there's cycles and we're in a
more competitive phase of that cycle currently. So, if there's only a secular shift in the
market, I think, these types of returns will be permanent, but being that we think we're in
a soft phase of the cycle, we do believe that there is potential for pricing to improve.
What we've really focused on is – as a company – is thinking about how to position
ourselves to make sure we're best combating both of those changes. So we've changed
the business mix, where our causality and specialty, it's – on an in-force basis is in excess
of $1 billion – which is a milestone for us. But that business does have a lower expected
profit, but also lower volatility.
We've seen increased growth across Lloyd's and across the platforms generally both
organically and inorganically, which is going to help with operating leverage. As Jeff had
mentioned, we do have excess capital, which is a drain currently. And then, finally, it's
affecting everybody equally but investment returns is something that – looking back at
historic returns, investments was a much larger contributor than it has been in the past.
So all that said, I think, we've got a very flexible platform. We've got access to multiple
capital sources and access to great business. And I think that we continue to focus on
great execution. We'll continue to provide superior returns. And as the market continues
to evolve and things change, I think, we're at the exact right place to take advantage of it.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Your line is
open.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Thank you. Buyback question number two. So you seem to be standing in front of us
saying, look, you feel that you have more capital than you need for your business. Can you
give us any idea? Is it bigger than a bread box? Can we talk about in terms of scale what
that might mean for shareholders to think about?

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks, Josh. Yes, bigger than a bread box. It would be – we don't say – we don't
identify specific numbers because that isn't how we think about it, but it's several hundred
million dollars, I would say.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Okay. That sounds very reasonable. And you did say that you deployed $600 million in
cash by Platinum. Is there any frame of reference that you have for how much cash you
got back? I mean, generally, we view Platinum or I view Platinum as an underutilized
balance sheet. Is there a net cash deployed idea that we can think about?

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Well, I would say we had some cash on the balance sheet, $100 million, $150 million, after
the Platinum deal closed. But we are – let's say, we have at least as much cash at the
holding company as we did now prior to the Platinum acquisition.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Okay. And then one final question in this same sort of area. In terms of thinking about
ASRs versus open market, you guys have been very much wanting to buy your stock as
cheaply as possible, which prefers open market. But given what might be your ambitions
to do buybacks, are you worried about any constraints on the amount of shares available
in the market to manage what you might have in mind, depending on the hurricane
season's outcome?

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

No. I don't think we've – I mean there are sometimes seasonally when volumes are lower
than we like. But I would say, over time, we have not had any significant issue around
acquiring the amount of shares we'd like to get in the open market. And, again, I'd just
remind that we bought over $500 million worth of stock in 2014.

Hi. Good morning, Kevin and Jeff. Thank you for taking the call. So, Kevin, we've always
liked your approach to property cat. It seems smart because you use proprietary models
to identify high risk return deals and strategically a lot of capital management via retro and
partnerships and then just tactically being very smart about scaling up and down based on
the market. And, I think, everybody generally thinks that you had the best mousetrap in
the old world.
And so, I wondered if I could ask you sort of big picture. What do you think the best
mousetrap is in the new world? And are you – you're obviously growing a lot in casualty, in
Lloyd's and the acquisition of Platinum. Is there a way to build a RenRe for the new world?
Or should we read the acquisition and all of the consolidation we've seen since as
basically more evidence that really it's less about being special and more about size is
going to be a dominant driver of scale and return over the next few years?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Yeah. Thinking about the position that we're in, we really like the things that we're doing.
So I'll divide my comments between cat and specialty and then talk about the group as a
combined entity. Within cat, we, I believe, have the model that is going to be the winning
model, where we're managing our own capital and we're managing capital for others.
With that, we have a great underwriting capabilities and great capabilities to figure out,
which is the right vehicle for us to deposit the risk in which we're taking and to manage
that risk.
I think if we translate that over to the specialty, many of the things that we're doing on cat
are transferrable to specialty. We understand how to build risk distributions. We
understand the importance of structuring the tail appropriately. And, increasingly, we are
deploying our gross to net strategies on the casualty business with significant – as we gain
significant scale there, we have greater opportunity to optimize portfolios, not just on the
gross basis, but on the net basis.
By bringing the two businesses together, we added operating leverage and capital
efficiency, which is beneficial in today's market. I think thinking about the company in the
future, there's nothing different about RenRe today than what we were like five years

ago, 10 years ago or when I joined almost 20 years ago. We think about the world the
same way. And we're building portfolios against the market opportunity that's available.
Our desire to increase in cat is exactly what it's always been. If there was an opportunity
to double the size of our cat book, we would do it tomorrow. If there was an opportunity
to double the casualty book, we would do it tomorrow. And I think that sort of forward
leaning posture is something that will facilitate our moves to see market changes more
quickly than anyone else.
The other thing I would point to is because of the way we structure the company, our
ability to collect capital as opportunities emerge is far greater now than it was in the past.
So, I feel that there is a secular shift where the market is maturing and becoming more
competitive. That's something we all have to deal with. But we've positioned ourselves as
best we can to make sure that we optimize on opportunities as they emerge.

Q - Josh Clayton Stirling

{BIO 17463087 <GO>}

Well, that's helpful, Kevin. Then the gross to net comment sound very much like the old
RenRe. So, we'll look forward to that developing. I am interested though a little tactically,
just as a follow-up, on -

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Sure.

Q - Josh Clayton Stirling

{BIO 17463087 <GO>}

Obviously casualty and specialty pricing and some of the commentary from like Lloyd's
and brokers is not that constructive on pricing, more meaningful price declines than we've
seen in other parts of the business. I'm curious to see, one, if that's sort of consistent with
what you guys are seeing, but the – in your businesses there. But then also, as you think
about sort of the tactical overlay of the strategy of, hey, let's try to be smart like we used
to be in or like we are in property cat, but in a way that it's a differentiated market in
casualty and specialty. How do you overlay that with the sort of the tactical, cyclical,
challenge of what seems to be a softening market in some of these other areas?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
So, in general, I agree with the comments that the market is becoming more competitive.
So, then looking at our response to that is, within Lloyd's, although we've had good
growth, it's still off a modest pace. So, we're seeing opportunities that emerge really from
three things I'll point to. One is just writing more lines for our core clients; secondly,
leveraging relationships that our underwriters have had for a long time; and thirdly,
increasing participations on deals we're already on. So, we're not looking to enter the
most competitive markets and find the one good deal. We're looking to very targeted
opportunities to grow. And we've been fortunate to continue to find those in kind of in the
narrow brands that I discussed.
Within casualty and specialty, more broadly, we're not, what I would call, a diversified
general casualty player. We still are focused on many specialty lines. And those specialty
lines have shifted over the last several years. So, we are moving in and out of
Page 13 of 23

FINAL

opportunities as appropriate. And then, thirdly, the increased sessions have improved our
margins within casualty and specialty. So, the trick there is we are still enormously capital
efficient to run that business. But, by adding ceded, we're still relieving some of the price
pressure that's been resonate in the market and improving net returns to us on a gross –
on a standalone basis and a marginal basis within our portfolios.

Your next question comes from the line of Seth Canetto with KBW. Please go ahead.

Q - Seth J. Canetto

{BIO 20249864 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hey. Good morning. I just had one question about your comments with Florida and how
there is – you guys are adding more nationwide coverage with Florida exposure, while
reducing sort of the pure play Florida exposure companies. What's your view on the
impact of AIR's latest U.S. hurricane model on your PMLs and do you believe the new
model will affect industry domain?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
So, first, the effect on us is – the way we think about a new model is we want to
understand not just what the percent changes is, if they're up X percent across the coast
or in Florida, but to understand why they have changed their view of risk. So we will rip the
model back down to its primary parts, look at frequency, look at damage functions and
look at the industry profile that's embedded beneath it to make sure that we understand
which components are changing. Ideally, we will find components of the new model that
we like and incorporate it into REMS, which is our independent view of risk.
So, for us, it's going to be a bit of a scientific exercise to see how we can improve our
view of risk, but it will not change our PMLs simply because a new model is released with
higher PMLs in Gulf regions or in wind exposed regions. With regard to the market overall,
less convinced that it will have a material impact on the way people are thinking about
structuring their programs or thinking about the risk that they have. But that's something
that – it will take some time to figure out whether people adopt it or not.

Your next question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.

FINAL

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Good morning. Thank you. Just adding question number three to buyback. Just basically
your decision now to renew the retro coverage in Florida, would that impact your ability or
like basically you said in the past you normally like slowing down during the peak of the
hurricane season. But, last year, you were able to buy some retro cover that reduced your
net – that you actually did large buyback during the hurricane season. So I just wonder if
that would like slow your buyback during the hurricane season.

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Slow our what back? I'm sorry I missed.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Buybacks.

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell

Bloomberg Transcript

Oh, slow buybacks. Let me answer the ceded question. And I think that will feed into the
buyback. We are not a traditional purchaser of retro or ceded protection. We will build our
gross portfolios as efficiently as we can and constantly be in the market looking for ceded
opportunities that improve the overall efficiency of the portfolio.
We made the decision to purchase less ceded in Florida, because of all the things we
talked about with the changing profile of our book of business. We did see a greater
opportunity to deploy capacity on a gross basis in Florida, because prices were down less
than we originally anticipated. But at the net – at the – the net result is a portfolio that we
liked more, because prices were better than the portfolio that we pro forma at going into
the Florida specific renewal.
The other thing I'd say is we did add some specific structures around our Florida book,
which were different than last year. So although we did not renew the cover that we talked
about on last year's call, we do have some other facilities supporting us in Florida, which, I
think, again, improved the overall efficiency of the portfolio.
With regard to how that informs our buyback strategies, our buyback strategy
incorporates all the things that are going on within the organization. Our first objective is
to deploy capital into the business. To the extent we can't deploy capital into the business
we'll look to return it. And our preferred way to return it remains through share buybacks.
But we need to be cognizant of external factors at the time of our buybacks. So Jeff
talked a lot about the work that we did internally about bringing capital back up to the
holding company through the acquisition of Platinum. But we also need to be cognizant
that as we go into peak exposure periods, i.e., wind season, we're thoughtful about the

Page 15 of 23



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2015-07-29

risks that we have. Not purchasing that ceded specifically is not something that will change
our decisions as to how we behave with buybacks going into this wind season.

FINAL

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

The only thing I would add to Kevin's comments is where ceded purchase does or does
not come in is in our assessment of how much excess capital we have. So, excess capital –
our assessment of excess capital is the raw material for buybacks. That does incorporate
ceded. And as I said earlier, I think we come into this at this point with very healthy level of
capital flexibility.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Thank you for the details. Then follow-up on Lloyd's. So, it looks like you have pretty
healthy growth over there. And so do you think you're at a level – at a scale that – in terms
of an operating expense ratio in the low 20%s – is that where you want to be or there is
room for further leverage on that?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell

Bloomberg Transcript

That's a great question, because one of the things we talked about in our building Lloyd's
over the last several years is the growth is really catching up to the infrastructure. So,
we're delighted that we are at a scale where our expense ratio is coming in line with the
Lloyd's market. But the infrastructure that we have can continue to add premium without a
proportional increase in expense for that premium. So we do have more scope to
increase the size of Lloyd's and further improve the expense ratio there.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. Lastly, on the Platinum, you had – this quarter you had $33 million reserve releases.
How much of that coming from Platinum? More generally, just now you have a quarter
after integration of Platinum. Do you see like different reserving philosophy on the owned
book versus yours? How do you think that would play out over the course of next few
years?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
So, we are really looking at the company as a single enterprise going forward. And I think,
increasingly, it's going to become difficult to know whether reserve releases or premium
or – is coming from one book or is coming from the legacy RenRe book or the legacy
Platinum book because – an example might be if we're both on the same deal and we
have reserve releases on the same deal, we're not going to track it as a legacy Platinum
reserve release and a legacy RenRe reserve release. We're going to look at it as a
combined entity going forward, both underwriting side and on the claims and reserve
side.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Good morning.

Q - Sarah E. DeWitt

{BIO 18946247 <GO>}

Given some of the secular shifts that you've talked about, do you think your acquisition of
Platinum is enough? Or could you look to do some more acquisitions to position the
company for this new world?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Well, let me comment on Platinum and then comment on kind of how we think about the
world. So we're delighted with Platinum. We are ahead of plans with our integration and
we're seeing great coordination across our underwriting platforms which is producing new
opportunities on each of our balance sheets. We've been fortunate to get the regulatory
approvals to move capital around and have enhanced the ratings on the balance sheet.
So, all of those things are moving along at a great pace and according to our original deal
thesis.
With regard to the future, we are focused on execution. And we feel that we are
achieving good organic growth in the platforms that we have. And we are best positioned
in the cat market, which is difficult right now. We will consider additional acquisitions if we
see opportunities that further our strategy and financially make sense, but it's not
something that we need to do to continue to execute of all the things that we're doing.
One of the components or one of the pieces that has been discussed is that there's a
need for size in this business. And I can say that none of our clients have expressed any
concern about our size between not only the owned capital that we have, but the
managed capital that we can bring there to the risk that they're looking to cede.
So I think there is a minimum size, but it's not something that we're even close to having –
needing to have a conversation to determine whether we're above it. We're focused not
so much on accumulating capital, but really on bringing good solutions and adding value
Page 17 of 23



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td

to our customers. And as long as we continue to do that, I don't anticipate that the size
dialogue that's been in the market is really going to include someone like Renaissance.

{BIO 18946247 <GO>}

FINAL

Great. Thanks. And when you look at your infrastructure or your business mix, what would
be on your wish list for what you would look to consider?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
There are – certainly, one can wish for higher interest rates. One can wish for a better
market. But I don't think that's a practical way to approach the world. I think what we are
doing is the right things. And I think the one thing that we need to maintain is a strong
focus on executing against the three superiors that we've always talked about. We are
working hard to get closer to our customers. We are continuing to invest in our systems
and our people. And we are a disciplined capital manager having to – managed over $1
billion of capital between deploying into Platinum and the share buybacks next year and
building the flexibility back at the holding company that we had prior to the acquisition. So,
actually, I feel pretty good about all the things that we're doing and don't spend a lot of
time wishing for the world to be different. I just focus on executing in the world that we
have.

Your next question comes from the line of Ian Gutterman with Balyasny. Your line is open.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Hi. Thank you. First, Jeff, I had a question on the balance sheet. I was a little confused by
the invested asset movement in the quarter. It looked like it went up about $600 million
sequential. I'm assuming since Platinum should have been on the books at March 31, that
seemed like a big move. It looked like half of it was maybe $300 million some move in
this investment payable, which I was wondering what that was. Even without that, $300
million seem pretty big sequential.
And then the other investment question related – and then I have an underlying question –
is the investment income from fixed maturities was only up about $8 million and Platinum
on their own, I think, was running at about $17 million. I know, obviously, cash came out in
the deal, but when I take the cash that came out in the deal that doesn't explain the delta.
So, the other part of it is – so, I guess, this equates to two questions. One, why are the
invested assets up so much? And two, why is the investment income lower than what it
looked like pro forma should be?

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Let me take the second question first, Ian. I think the answer to the second question is
that we continue to reallocate the Platinum portfolio from a structure that we acquired to
Page 19 of 23



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2015-07-29

FINAL

one that more closely matches our own allocations and allocation strategies. We have
picked managers for virtually all of the mandates to which we want to allocate that. But, in
some instances, those managers haven't fully funded those mandates. So, we still
probably have a few hundred million dollars that is either in cash or has not been allocated
to the specific allocations that we anticipate.
I expect that will add some more to investment income, but that's probably measured in
low to mid single-digits of millions, not vast quantities. Effectively, we inherited a portfolio
though, I think, about 1.5% yield and we anticipated we could push that up maybe 20 basis
points. And I think we're still on track to do that to match our own yield on our investment
portfolio. So we expect that will be the case.

increase in the balance sheet, Ian.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Okay. Yeah. Why don't I move on to Kevin then? Kevin, I guess, two quick questions. One, I
was a little surprised that the managed cat GPW was flattish. I guess I would've thought
that given all the – I mean I'm guessing obviously on how much premium there was on the
FHCF. I think knowing your line size and I can get – they are – well, I can get a pretty good
guess at it. I would have thought that would have been a big help. Did you sort of view
that as replacing other Florida capacity as opposed to a growth opportunity? And it was
more you got off something else to write FHCF or was there some other offset that
suppressed the managed cats?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
The FHCF is a large component of how we structure the Florida book. But it wasn't at the
cost of doing anything else. We had ample room to write that as well as our existing lines.
We chose not to write some of our existing lines simply because we thought the pricing
was inadequate for the risk.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Okay. Got it. Okay. I mean it just looks like if I took out my guess on that, you would have
had a very healthy double-digit decline in managed cat?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
I think it's difficult to extract one deal and then assume nothing else changes.

FINAL

Okay. Well, that's kind of what I was wondering. Okay. Okay. Got it. And then the other one
on the quarter is can you just talk a little bit about – it's not just you. We've seen this across
a number of companies reporting. I guess I have been surprised that events like the Texas
storms and other U.S., what I'll call, small PCS events, meaning maybe they're reaching $1
billion. They're not reaching $3 billion or $4 billion, $5 billion.
In the past, those didn't cause reinsurance losses, at least of any – maybe they caused
single-digit million, but nothing that would disrupt – be noticeable to anyone's quarter.
Why did these seem to have increases? Just people are writing more regionals or are
regionals buying lower than they used to? Is that to do with aggregate covers? Just it
feels like if these events happened five years ago, we would assume smaller losses. I
don't know if that's fair or not.

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell

Bloomberg Transcript

I think it is a little bit of a function of where the losses, the land. Some places like Florida
with a lot of regional covers, smaller losses are transferred. There are some regional
covers in Texas as well. And just, by their nature, there'll be focused concentrations. And a
smaller event will attach their programs as compared to the nationwide purchases, which
are more broadly protecting many states.
I wouldn't point to anything specific except back to the comment that I made before
where there are increased hours clauses, which can aggregate events differently than one
would have expected a few years ago, making sure that as an underwriter you're
understanding how those terms are changing and how it's likely to affect the claims
coming through. One that was particularly difficult this – over the first half of the year was
the Northeast winter storms because the snow accumulated over several events, but
accumulated on top of the previous storms. And then many of the losses that have come
in have come in from ice dams, which makes the allocation back to the original -

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Difficult. That's not a soft market phenomenon. That's something that hard or soft market
experience. But other than that, I wouldn't point to anything at least in our book of
business that is other than what I would consider normal cat activity.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Okay. So you don't feel like you're attaching at least significantly lower to regional storms
than you do have historically?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
No. We've kind of been different as to whether we attach higher or low. It's really whether
we compensate it for that attachment.

Q - Seth J. Canetto

{BIO 20249864 <GO>}

Hi. I just had one follow-up question. You guys mentioned that you still believe the Jan 1
renewal season will be difficult due to the current competitive market conditions. But
given the distraction other companies have with all of the M&A occurring in the industry,
do you see any meaningful opportunity to pick up additional business that might offset
some of those headwinds considering you guys closed the deal with Platinum back in
March?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Yes. I think there's the macro environment is to – we think it will still be competition for
lines. I think the answer to that is yes. But on a more focused – through a more focused
lens, I absolutely think there will be opportunities, where companies are either – and
there's an uncertainty around the closing of a transaction or there's uncertainty around
what the future looks like for an entity, which will create opportunities for us.
We couldn't be happier to have the Platinum integration as far along as it is and for us to
be presenting ourselves as the unified single company. And I think that's going to provide
opportunities for us on a focused basis. But, on a macro basis, I do think there'll be
continued competition. As what happens at the 6/1 and 7/1 is a very specific renewal. And
it is hard to forecast that forward to the more broad 1/1 renewal.

that that will – on the casualty and specialty, in particular, we'll find great opportunities as
