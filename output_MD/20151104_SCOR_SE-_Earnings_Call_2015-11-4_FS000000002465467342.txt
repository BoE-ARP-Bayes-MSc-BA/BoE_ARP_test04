MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the SCOR Group's Q3 2015 Results
Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded.
At this time, I would like to hand the call over to Mr. Bertrand Bougon, Head of Investor
Relations and Rating Agencies. Please go ahead, sir.

Bertrand Bougon

{BIO 18934799 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining the SCOR Group's third quarter 2015
results. As usual, on page two, please consider our disclaimer, which indicates that the
presented Q3 2015 financial information is unaudited.

We can now start the presentation, and I would like to give the floor to Mr. Denis Kessler,
CEO and Chairman of the SCOR Group, who is joined on this call by the entire COMEX.

FINAL

[05HFRJ-E Denis Kessler]
Thank you very much, Bertrand Bougon. Good morning, everyone. I'm extremely pleased
this quarter as all the lights are green for SCOR. We are recording what we consider
excellent results. We've been upgraded by some rating agencies, as you know, during Q3.
And we have received positive news from the ACPR, who is the main regulator for the
SCOR Group, of its intention to approve the group's internal model. And so it was, for us,
it's a major milestone. We'll be spending 10 years to build up this internal model, which is
operational, and that would be the tool to assess the solvency and its evolution of the
SCOR Group. These are really major achievements for SCOR, which confirms the
relevance of our business model and of our Tier 1 position.
On the financial front, SCOR recorded a robust growth of 19.3% in current exchange rates
for the first nine months. We have a very strong profitability, above 11% of ROE, and a net
income of €492 million, up 31% year-on-year. And we'll come back on that of what we
consider again a very solid solvency position.

Bloomberg Transcript

Both targets of our strategic plan, Optimal Dynamics, have been met or exceeded for the
nine months to 2015. The solvency ratio is in the optimal range, and our return on equity
exceeding the 1,000 basis points above the risk-free rate targets. We have met the two
targets of the group: solvency and profitability.
And we're truly extremely pleased that over the summer we were upgraded back to AAby S&P and Fitch, and also to A positive outlook by A.M. Best. This clearly confirms that
SCOR is a Tier 1 global reinsurer, and it does reinforce the fact that SCOR is a highly
diversified market leader with a critical size to fully benefit from economies of scale and
economies of scope. This means that we are price makers and we are among those
setting terms and conditions, which is a key differentiator in such P&C environment.
SCOR is global and not just international and writing risk today in more than 160 countries.
SCOR is a trend-setter and an industry shaper, actively involved in key industry
discussions. SCOR is driven by innovation and develops many of its own tools and
processes starting with its internal model which is homemade that has been built internally
by the SCOR teams. Finally, SCOR is independent, which is crucial in order to serve clients
on a global basis without conflicts of interest. Being Tier 1 clearly illustrates the strength in
financial (04:06) security and global franchises (04:09) with clients, particularly in the
current market environment.
A major milestone has been achieved with the official notification by the ACPR of its
intention to approve the internal model. We are, today, officially fully ready for Solvency II.
As far as I'm aware, we should be the first company to receive approval for its full internal
model, which is (04:37) extremely important.

FINAL

Mark and Frieder already talked about it during the Investor Day we did September, but
let me remind you that our internal model enables optimal and dynamic capital
management on a global basis. We made the ambitious choice to have one single model
for managing a business and for regulatory purposes.
There are three objectives to perfectly describe the internal model. It's a full model, so
it's comprehensive, it's holistic and it's stochastic, (05:13) model in a stochastic way
including the operational risks. In addition, the model optimally reflects a vision and
experience of the risks we have in the portfolio, and we've mobilized all the underwriters
to extract their knowledge and to feed the internal model with a judgment and their
knowledge and their expertise.
And as we don't choose any traditional measures, we're not exposed to subsequent
changes related to the standard formula. I repeat, we don't use traditional measures to
assess the solvency. Based on our full internal model or solvency ratio for year-end 2014
(05:53) stands at 202%, which means that we have twice the level of capital that we
would need to respect the portfolio of risk we have booked. Since the beginning of the
year, solvency ratio has evolved within the optimal range of the solvency scale, reaching
214% at the end of H1 2015 – at the end of June and 208% at the end of Q3 2016, as you
will see later. This solvency ratio, of course, changes since (06:29) interest rate changes.

Let me now hand over to Mark, who will give you more details on the financial
performance. Mark, the floor is yours.

Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Thank you, Danny (06:38). So moving on to slide six. Let me briefly summarize the key
financial figures for Q3 2015 as Danny (06:45) mentioned in his introduction. SCOR wrote
approximately €10 billion of gross written premiums in the first nine months of 2015, which
represents a 19.3% increase at current exchange rates and a 5.8% increase at constant
exchange rates compared to last year. This top line growth is driven by the contribution of
both business engines, SCOR Global P&C with an 18.4% growth at current exchange rates
and SCOR Global Life with a 19.9% growth at current exchange rates.
SCOR recorded high-quality results for the first nine months of 2015 with a net income of
€492 million, an increase of 31% year-on-year, generating an 11.1% return on equity which
exceeds the group's target set at 1,000 basis points above the risk-free rate.
The P&C net combined ratio for the first nine months of the year stood at 90.8% in an
environment of low nat cats and an unusually high frequency of large man-made losses
such as the Tianjin port explosion. The Life technical margin remained stable at 7.2%,
exceeding the Optimal Dynamics assumption, while SCOR Global Investments delivered a
solid return on invested assets of 3.1% driven by active portfolio management.
On page eight, shareholders' equity shows that it has increased by 6.5% since the
beginning of the year to reach €6.1 billion. The shareholders' equity was boosted by the
strong net income recorded in Q3, a strong foreign exchange impact, which increased the

currency translation adjustment to €215 million, while accounting for the €260 million in
dividends paid out in Q2.

FINAL

The book value per share stands at €32.65 per share. As part of our successful €250
million dated subordinated debt issuance in June, we called a €93 million debt due in
2020 on July 6. The financial leverage ratio now stands at 23%, below the 25% ceiling
stated in Optimal Dynamics.
On page nine, as expected, the operational cash flow is back to a normalized level on a
year-to-date basis. It stands now at €558 million for the first nine months of 2015, which is
in line with the normalized operational cash flow of about €200 million per quarter. The
increase in net cash flows used in financing activities is driven by the dividend payment
and debt repayments in Q2 and Q3, offset by the debt issuance that we had in Q2.
The total liquidity increased to just under €2 billion at September 30. It is in line with the
momentary pause of the rebalancing of the investment portfolio, on which François will
discuss later on. Approximately, €6.1 billion of liquidity, including cash and short-term
investments, is expected to be generated within the next 24 months from the maturity of
fixed income securities and interest coupons.
I'll now hand it over to Victor for the P&C results.

Bloomberg Transcript

Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Thank you, Mark, and good morning. I'm going to comment on another set of excellent
P&C figures at the end of the third quarter of the year.
As you can see on slide 10, the development of our business is well on track with the
Optimal Dynamics strategic plan, with growth of nearly 6% at constant exchange rates.
This growth corresponds to the indication that we have given you since the beginning of
the year.
Thanks to the positive effect of the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to the euro, our
forecast for the full-year 2015 is now slightly higher than the €5.6 billion that we indicated
to you at the IR Day. We are now estimating that the top line will be in the range of €5.7
billion €5.8 billion for the full-year.
The other performance indicators are similarly showing that our technical ratios are
staying in line with the assumptions of the plan, with the only caveat being, as Mark
mentioned, that the effect of the low nat cat activity has been slightly counter-balanced by
the unusually high number of large man-made losses in Q1 and Q3. In these
circumstances, our net combined ratio comes out at 90.8% on a year-to-date basis; and if
normalized, based on a budgeted 7 percentage points of nat cat, it stands at 96.2%.
As we explained in our previous quarterly results presentation, it makes more sense to
look at the behavior of the attritional loss plus commission ratio, as a whole, rather than at
Page 4 of 21



FINAL

Company N ame: SCOR SE
Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity
Date: 2015-11-04

each of the two ratios separately. This is because part of the increase in the commissions
on proportional business reflects the sharing with our clients of the decrease of the
attritional loss ratios on the underlying portfolios. Because of the unusually high number of
large man-made losses in Q2 and Q3, we currently stand at approximately 1.5 percentage
points above the 81% assumed attritional loss plus commission ratio that we showed to
you at the IR Day. This 1.5 percentage points need to be compared with the 3.1percentage point charge coming from three major man-made losses, sustained in Q2 and
Q3 for net amount pre-tax of €56 million, €32 million, and €28 million, respectively.
These figures confirm two characteristics of our business model. First, our control and
medium risk appetite, if one refers to the amounts of this – of each of these three losses
relative to our equity, and second, the shock absorbing capabilities of our portfolios;
thanks to the combination of their diversification and their balance. Whilst, our normalized
net combined ratio for the full-year is likely to stay impacted by the spike of man-made
losses in Q2 and Q3 does not call into question a long-term assumption of our global
portfolio to run at a normalized net combined ratio of around 94%, nor it does call into
question the basis on which the renewals are going to be managed with the clear
objective to protect the expected overall technical profitability from the business that is
going to be booked.
Paolo will now present the Life figures.

Paolo de Martin

{BIO 15930577 <GO>}

Thank you, Victor. Let's now move on to page 11 of the presentation. I'm pleased to report
that SCOR Global Life continues to record healthy growth and an excellent technical
performance in the first nine months of 2015. We are consistently delivering above the
Optimal Dynamics assumptions in line with prior quarters and the disclosures given at the
recent Investor Day.
Our gross written premium reached €5.6 billion, which represents a growth of 19.9% at
current exchange rate, or 5.8% at constant exchange rates. This growth is well balanced
across our three key offerings.
In Protection, we're successfully growing through new business flows, in particular, in Asia
Pacific, where we are growing at the rate of over 20% year-over-year. In Longevity,
starting from a relatively small basis, we continue the strong trend shown during the
recent Investor Day. In Financial Solutions, we are at last year levels in terms of premiums.
Regulatory regimes remain influx, and this has influenced in the current business pipeline
in this line. Nonetheless, we've seen an increase in new business opportunities; notably, in
Asia.
Overall, our technical performance over the first nine months of 2015 stands at 7.2%,
ahead of the 7% expected in Optimal Dynamics. We've been able to deliver this strong
technical margin, thanks to the profitability of new business, which continues to meet the
group ROE target of 1,000 basis points over the risk-free rate. And thanks to a very
healthy in-force portfolio with mortality experience in line with our expectations. In

particular, and in anticipation of any questions, as of Q3 closing, our U.S. mortality book is
performing to plan.

FINAL

With this, I will now hand over to François de Varenne, CEO of SCOR Global Investments,
who will update you on our group investment strategy.

François de Varenne
Thank you, Paolo. Moving on to slide 12, SCOR's total investment portfolio reached €26.3
billion at the end of September with an invested asset portfolio of €17.4 billion, which
remain broadly stable compared to the previous quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

The global environment remains very challenging. Uncertainties related to Central Bank
strategies, notably, regarding future rates hikes by the Fed, an enlarged QE in the
Eurozone, coupled with a slowdown of emerging countries, in particular, in China, ongoing
geopolitical tensions have generated increased volatility and risk aversion across all
markets. In this context, SCOR Global Investments has maintained the cautious strategy
implemented in the course of the second quarter of this year. We have tactically and
momentarily increased our liquidity well above our strategic allocation objective at 11% of
invested assets.
In the same time, the duration of the fixed income portfolio remains broadly stable at four
years. The high quality and high liquidity of the fixed income portfolio has been
maintained with a stable average rating of AA minus. Besides, SCOR Global Investments
has maintained a very strict policy of avoiding any sovereign exposure to Eurozoneperipheral countries. At the end of September, expected cash flows on the fixed income
portfolio, over the next 24 months, stand at €6.1 billion, including cash and short-term,
facilitating a dynamic management of the reinvestment policy.
In spite of the adverse economic environment and the prolonged low-yield context in all
major currencies, SCOR Global Investments manages to deliver a strong and recurring
return on invested assets, which stands at 3.1% for the first nine months of 2015 well
above our duration adjusted risk we benchmarked. In comparison, the performance
during the same period in 2014 stood at 2.9%.
Our investment yield on yielding asset classes stand at 2% at the end of Q3, reflecting
the decrease in global rates that occurred in the course of the quarter. SCOR Global
Investments remains confident despite an exceptionally low-yield environment in its ability
to deliver for the full-year 2015 a return on invested assets in the top of the 2.7%, 2.9%
range that was mentioned at the beginning of the year, and above (17:37) 3% in 2016.
And now, I will hand over to Bertrand Bougon for the conclusion of the presentation.

Ladies and gentlemen, we will now move onto the Q&A session. We will now take our first
question from Michael Huttner of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Fantastic. Can you hear me?

A - Bertrand Bougon

{BIO 18934799 <GO>}

Yes. Sure, we can.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Yeah. Fantastic. Good morning. Lovely results. It's nice to see companies doing fantastic.
So my real only question because, Mark, you said it with such enthusiasm is the €10 billion.
You said, oh, €10 billion, oh, yeah, it's great numbers; premiums, of course. I know it's not
profits. But my question really is, when would you reach €20 billion? (19:41) I know it sounds
flippant and you might say, oh gosh, come on. But given the strong solvency, the good
outlook on margins, which you're stating, again, and et cetera, surely, you must be
thinking, oh, we could accelerate growth a little bit here. So, really, the question is to know
how that has evolved and how quickly we could see maybe a deal, even. That's it. Thank
you.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Mark, you have the floor. (20:16) how you answer, by the way.

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

We had some technical issues with the sound. So I think I've got the gist of your question. I
think there's an organic element to it, and a M&A question embedded at the end. So the
growth, you're right. I mean, we're currently at just under €10 billion in gross written
premium year-to-date. It's a very significant achievement. We're having significant organic
growth this year.
Historically, we've also had acquisitions that have really helped us especially on the Life
side in terms of developing franchise. So the key metric for us on growth is that it's
profitable, that it meets the objectives of the group in terms of a threshold ROE, and
that's the test that's provided to the growth. Otherwise, we won't grow. It simply has to
be as simple as that.
On the M&A side, I think we've made this very clear at the IR Day that we're a Tier 1
reinsurer. We're fully global and capable with our franchise that M&A is not a necessity for
Page 7 of 21

FINAL

us. It's an option if something was to come up, but it's clearly not something that's
needed for the group to be successful. I think we've demonstrated that now with the
organic growth figures that you've seen. And the types of companies that are engaging in
those discussions of M&A are really being forced by the market to do so, SCOR's not in
that position.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Operator
We will now take our next question from Kamran Hossain of RBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi. Good morning. Just I wanted first of all, to say congratulations on the model approval.
I've got two questions. The first one, now you do have your model approved, have you
got any thoughts about adjusting the, I guess, the solvency ranges? So I guess, anything
over 220% (22:23) you signaled at the Investor Day could come back to shareholders. Any
thoughts about adjusting that in the near term?
And the second question, just on mortality. Just coming back to Paolo's comments on
slide 11 that you've had – you've got a healthy in-force portfolio with mortality experience
in line with expectations. In the last couple of days, you've seen a paper from Angus
Deaton, one of the Nobel prize winners for economics, about U.S. mortality. And in that
paper, he basically looks at changes to mortality rates for groups in the U.S. So one trend
he's highlighted is that white middle-aged Americans are seeing, kind of, I guess,
deteriorating mortality. How – what's factored into your assumptions for your EV? Because
I know that your EV is very, very, very sensitive to any changes in mortality assumptions.
Could you just talk me through that, so just kind of give me a little bit of comfort that I'm
not making a mountain out of a molehill. Thanks.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

With regard to your questions, maybe we should start by mortality in the U.S. I have had
the pleasure – I know Angus Deaton. I worked with him back in 1982. And he's a great guy.
So I'm very happy as far as him concerns, it's a personal statement, he's got the Nobel
prize anyway. Paolo, on mortality in the U.S.

A - Paolo de Martin

{BIO 15930577 <GO>}

Yeah. I think the – the five-second answer is that the data released in July around mortality
improvement or a decrease in mortality improvement does not have, at this point, the
material impact on our projection and our model. That's the five-second answer. Now if
you allow me, like, just a couple of minutes on this to get a bit more into the details.
First of all, I'd like to make – there are two comments we really need to make as
introductory comments to this. First of all, the insured populations are significantly

Page 8 of 21



Company N ame: SCOR SE
Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity
Date: 2015-11-04

FINAL

different than the overall general population. Particularly, in the U.S., the insured population
tends to be focusing much higher socioeconomic classes, which have access to better
healthcare and living conditions. So, to give you an example, the average policy written by
our clients in the last three years of our top 10 clients is about $600,000 per policy.
In addition, there is a tight medical and financial underwriting process at origination, which
tends to eliminate applicants with poor health status and ensure the assured amount is
commensurate with the insurable interest. And this tends to result in a greater proportion
of preferred risks overall in our population.
This is supported by the fact that when we look at our data, actually, the cause of death
are different than the general population cause of death that you find in this industry
(25:20) data. The second general comment is from an insurance regulatory perspective,
the industry is not allowed to differentiate premium or underwriting by race or ethnicity. So
even if there could be a direct correlation between ethnic groups and higher and lower
expected mortality, data by race and ethnicity is not captured and, therefore, cannot be
studied by us.

Bloomberg Transcript

Therefore, when we look at our experience, we look at total by age group and gender for
trends in mortality improvement overall. But we cannot give any weight in our analysis to
any paper published that uses race as a discriminator despite, I think, personally, the fact
being extremely interesting and relevant for public bodies. These are two general
comments on this.
Now, coming to the fact underlying the article that you had mentioned, in July, there was
new U.S. national population mortality data were released. We're seeing what we call the
Human Mortality Database, the HMD. The HMD update included three additional years,
2011, 2012, and 2013. And we need to remember that the last census in the U.S. was in
2010 and, therefore, exposure data post-2010 are based on extrapolations. And it is
important also to note that the last census gave material update. The last census in 2010
gave a material update to data between 2000 and 2010. So that data are still provisional.
Said this, the data do indicate a slowdown in mortality improvement. So what does that
mean for us in more detail? Well, our experience, we think, the insured population is
significantly different than that of the general population, and we expect this difference to
continue into the future. In addition, we have historically set our long-term improvement
assumption at a conservative and of a reasonable range.
So as a result, the impact from the reduction in population mortality improvement, as I
said at the beginning, has no material effect effectively on our projections and models as
it is largely muted with some variations by gender and age and cohorts. Our global
mortality R&D center, which is now based in the U.S. continues to monitor these trends
very closely, and we will reflect changes in our long-term estimates as needed in the
future.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

That's fantastic. I really appreciate your comments on that.

Frieder, maybe on the solvency position?

FINAL

A - Frieder Knüpling
Yeah. As we stated during the IR Day, we are comfortable with the solvency situation of
the company as it is currently. We are where we wanted to be in the center of the optimal
range. And as you know, we are now in the process of preparing our next strategic plan,
which we are going to disclose in less than a year from now.
As part of this, we will also reassess solvency targets and potential need for any
adjustments now given that the model has been approved. But, at this point, there's no
intention to change the solvency targets in the short term.

Thank you. We will now take our next question from Xin Mei Wang of Morgan Stanley.
Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Xinmei Wang

{BIO 17860767 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. It's Xinmei Wang from Morgan
Stanley. I have two questions, please. So first is on the cost ratio. We're still seeing that
trend above the guided amount of 4.8% for Optimal Dynamics plan. So, I'm just – I'm
wondering why those costs are still coming in higher than expected and how we should
be thinking about that trend for the full-year and for next year, as well?
And my second question is on P&C. With the 7% growth in premiums at 3Q on constant
FX, would you be able to give some color on where that growth is coming from? And
maybe talk about how that ties into your outlook for pricing in 2016. Thank you.

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Let me answer on the cost ratio question that you put forward. We're currently at basically
5% ratio on a year-to-date basis, 5.01%. And for us, the cost ratio assumption that we had
in the Optimal Dynamics plan was to get to roughly to 4.8% by the end of the plan. So
we're slowly trending down that way. I think in the first half of the year, we had some
significant costs, for example, associated with Solvency II.
If you look at our stand-alone Q3 quarter-to-date ratio, you'll see something more in line
with 4.8%. It's actually 4.82%. So it's in the ballpark. I would say – I'm not trying to diminish
the relevance of the assumption, but I mean, the first focus is profitability. So there are
instances where we will spend more to get to more. So that the 4.8%, I think, is still
legitimate for next year. And it's trending that way, but we have had some additional
expenditures in H1 of 2015.

Q - In-Yong Hwang

{BIO 18784369 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi. Good morning. In-Yong Hwang from Goldmans. Two questions from me. Firstly, on kind
of your outlook for January renewals next year. I was wondering if there was anything
different that you've seen at Baden-Baden compared to what you were talking to in
Monte Carlo, how you see that developing there.
And secondly, on dividends, we've seen a very kind of steady trajectory in your nominal
dividends for the last four years and the payout has been roughly around 50%. I was
wondering if that's a level that we should be expecting to continue or whether you've
seen any kind of changes and opportunity to deploy your capital over the last 12 months
that would cause you to think differently about dividends. Thank you.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Well, I don't think that Baden-Baden has really changed the picture that we had in Monte
Carlo. And I'm just back from the SIRC Conference in Singapore. And I think that confirms
that what we were talking about, which is a soft landing of the soft market is still very
much there. And we believe that whilst the market is continuing to be competitive and
there may be some price reductions on the best clients and the best contracts while the
reduction should be lower than what we experienced last year.

On the dividend question, a few points to be made here. We discussed this as well during
the IR Day, because I do think it's a very important component of shareholder
remuneration. And so this decision process for us really starts to take shape in the
beginning months of 2016. I mean, the first objective for us is to secure the solvency

position that we want to be in, which is in the optimal range. And then we start
entertaining the question of organic growth. Can we grow at an accretive rate of the
1,000 basis points of ROE, and then the residual would be left for the dividend question.
So we've had successful organic growth through the last several years, and you've seen
us increase the dividend historically. And it's essential for us that when we do increase it,
that it's sustainable as well. So we're very proud of the fact that over the last 10 years,
we're one of two companies that has had a stable or increasing dividend. While I can't
give you guidance for next year, our history, I think, speaks very well to what you can
expect in the future.

Q - Frank Kopfinger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. Thank you. I have two questions. One on the investment income and
one on the reserving situation. On the investment income, I thought that the regular
income in Q3 was able to keep the level of Q2, the €110 million in Q3 versus €113 million in
Q2. In Q2, I assume this was also driven by the dividend income, so there must have been
something in Q3 that could somehow compensate for the lower dividends and
compensate in Q3. And I was wondering whether you could elaborate a little bit on this,
and whether that the €110 million level is the new regular investment income level that we
should expect going forward.
And then, on the reserving situation, historically, you had no real impact from reserve
releases being different from your major peers. And I was wondering whether you can
comment a little bit on how you see reserving situation and whether at some point in time
we should also expect some impact from reserve releases. And I clearly see that you
have a different setup and portfolio mix than most of your peers, but nevertheless, is
there a situation or possibility that in some point we see also reserve releases at your
side?

On your question on the investment income or the recurring yield on our portfolio, if you
look at the appendix on slide 34, you've got the detail of the income quarter-afterquarter in yields. I explained for the Q2 recurring yield, we had one-off effect, positive
one-off effect in Q2 and the seasonality of the dividend (36:19) of this effect in Q2 our

recurring yield was at 2.2%. We have same effect this quarter, so the 2.5% income yield
delivered by the portfolio is also impacted by some non-recurring positive one-offs.
We have positive impact from inflation in bonds at 48 (36:42) bps during this quarter. And
we have also some positive impact from some collection of previous quarter for 25 bps
also in this quarter. So restated of these one-offs and positive one-offs this quarter, the
recurring yield on invested assets stand at 2.2% this quarter, stable compared to, let's say,
the restated or the normalized income yield in Q2 at 2.2%.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Thank you, Francois. And if we go back now to the reserve question, Frieder?

A - Frieder Knüpling

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. So our Q3 reserves are, as always, best estimate plus a prudent margin. It's very
consistent with previous quarters. That hasn't changed in any significant way. As you know,
we have had a very stable and consistent reserving policy over the past years, which
focuses on, as I said, reserving best estimate plus a prudent margin. But without the aim
of managing our bottom line in an undue way through our reserve releases or one-off
reserve movements, so our focus has always been on generating sustainable results and
reserve movements are not supposed to influence this in a significant way.
Having said this, our intention is also not to accumulate useless reserve buffers in the
future. So if reserves were to develop such that the margin increased in a significant way,
we would make sure that this will reduce to a level, which is more commensurate with our
current reserving policies. So I don't want to exclude any reserve releases for the future,
but this is not our focus currently when – as I've said, we're not using that to manage our
bottom line.

Q - Olivia Brindle

{BIO 17273762 <GO>}

Hi there. Good morning. I just have one question relating to the underlying profitability in
P&C. So as you pointed out, if we take the net attritional and commission ratio, you are 1.5
percentage points above what you've guided to at the Investor Day, but the offset from
large man-made claims is 3.1%. So by implication the underlying was actually a lot better, if
we exclude those man-made claims. (39:26) my expectation of what that ratio should
have been the third quarter was clearly better as well. So I was just wondering if you could
comment on why that might be and what happened in the third quarter that would have

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Well, I think we have an attritional loss ratio trend that has been downwards for the last
few years by managing the portfolio. We are continuing that. And as I was commenting
while this is reflected also in the commission in the sense that when the underlying loss
ratios are improving, we share the benefit of it with the clients while allowing larger
commissions, which is why we look at the sum of the two.
So I don't think there is anything in particular. I mean, I think the underlying portfolio is just
behaving as we thought it would. And if you look at it, I mean, overall, I think we have a
spike for two quarters, and I expect that to renormalize over the next few quarters.

Our next question comes from Thomas Fossard of HSBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. Three question for me. The first one would be on, first, the group tax
rate. Year-to-date, you've got a group tax rate of 26.5%, which is quite different from the
22% guidance you've been providing. So, I guess, this is more a function of where you're
getting your strong results currently probably in high-tax countries, but could you just
comment on the – eventually the need to reassess the 22% normalized tax rate for the
group?
Second question will be for Victor, more thinking about the full year 2016 GWP numbers,
could you just remind us how much of the – are you writing currently from the big Chinese
motor quota-share? And how much of that could be non-renewed, I mean, in 2016, due to
C-ROSS implementation and potentially good margin of Chinese primary player?
And the last question will be for Mr. Kessler and related to slide four. I was interested in –
by the independent player box. Would you say or would you consider possibly Sompo
increasing its stake to 15% as something which would jeopardize the perception from your
client that you're an independent player in the market? Thank you.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Let me start with the tax question. So, year-to-date, you mentioned we're at little over
26%, so that's largely a function of the geographic mix of business and profitability. So,
we're in a low nat cat environment this year and that tends to concentrate profits into
higher tax jurisdictions. So, for us, when we confirmed the 22% tax rate, which I'm doing
right now, the statutory rate mix of our operating plan is still at the 22% level. That means
in a normal loss environment, where we have a normal distribution particularly on the P&C
side for nat cats and large losses, we do end up with a 22% rate.
We have had quarters in the past, I can recall, where we've had effective tax rates in the
high-teens. So it really depends on the distribution. In Q3, we can see for example, that
we're at 24.2%. So, I do confirm the 22%. We still have the 22% rate when we look at the
normal distribution of losses and what we're seeing right now is just normal volatility
based on the profitability of the business engines.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

So a 22% long-term normalized unlikely for full year 2015?

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Unlikely for this year. I think we have to have something dramatic just because of the size
of (44:25) thus far. And I would say that the assumption holds for the Optimal Dynamics
plan, which concludes at the end of next year. We'll reevaluate – at the IR Day, we'll
obviously discuss it, but I see nothing to change it right now.

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Understood.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Second question is about the Chinese situation due to C-ROSS. Victor?

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Well, I mean, this year, the renewal are going to be very late. The Chinese renewal are
generally very late. So all of this for the moment is not even yet started to be discussed.
So, I think it's very, very early in the process to talk about what's going to happen. But in
the very worst-case scenario, where this would be discontinued. We ourselves have had a
very limited activity on those motor quota-share, as both in terms of number of clients
with whom we have entertained those, as well as premium volume that it represents. You
are in a very low-single digit of the total premium of the division. So I don't expect that to
have an impact whatever happens. But, again, I mean, the situation is not that simple, and
there will be a lot of discussions during the next almost two months before we launch
somewhere with our Chinese clients.

What we can add, Victor, is we have taken, of course, measures to be fully compliant with
the C-ROSS new regulations, so we are ready. We've done exactly what needed to be
done. So, we are in China, we are growing in China, we have a strong relationship with the
Chinese clients. And we have exactly – we are set to benefit from market opportunities
for (46:15) change of regime is quite important, to go from the traditional Chinese
solvency regime to the new C-ROSS regime. We did anticipate it, and I believe that we're
exactly where we should be at this stage.
So, your last question, I cannot – I will not talk on behalf of Sompo. I mean, this is – any
question related to Sompo's strategy or decision, it needs to be asked to Sompo. It's a
rule that we always follow. At the time I'm talking to you, Sompo didn't cross its 10%
threshold. That's a fact.

Bloomberg Transcript

I know it because if Sompo were – did cross10% threshold, you have, in France, mandatory
declaration to the market authority, to the AMF. And we haven't seen the declaration by
Sompo. So, it's a situation where today Sompo's stake in SCOR is below 10%, and that's a
fact. I said and I repeat at this call, it is an independent company with a very well
diversified shareholder base, who is below 10%, the next shareholder is below 5%, today
and then we have lots of shareholders with stakes between 3%, 2%, 1%. That's what we
mean to be independent, which is through the well-diversified shareholder base with no
shareholders, who seem to take the control or having an influence on the SCOR strategy,
on the SCOR's management, and that's exactly where we are. So, it's the position of
SCOR. We are and we wish to remain an independent company, Thomas. So questions
related to Sompo needs to be asked to Sompo.

Hello. Hi, there. Just one small technical question. When I look at the Life results for Q3,
there is a very positive result from retro, which is normally, sort of, negative. Is there some

where we're moving from, I think, about €185 million (49:11)last year to €250 million (49:13)
this year, so we had a strong improvement. So that, we're really benefiting from profitable
growth and also for the continuous work we're doing on optimizing our in-force book. In
terms of the split between gross and retro, we had a one-off model change last year that
somehow skewed the split with minor impact on the net result, and that also distorts the
comparison in terms of prior year from gross to retro. We're not commenting on specific
action we are taking but we are taking significant time to optimize our in-force book both
on our gross and our retro side, but we're not making any specific comment.

Hi. Thanks very much. Two questions. Back on Life reinsurance, clearly your results
continue to benefit from the fact that you were able to re-price your exposures when you
acquired the two big portfolios in the States. Is there any way, Paolo, you can give us an
indication of how helpful that has been to maintaining your margin? So if you went back to
the original assumptions of the portfolio you bought, how much poorer would margin be
versus the 7%? And then secondly, just a very small one. Thank you very much for giving
your Solvency II ratios quarterly. That's really helpful and I hope you will continue to do so.

Thanks, William. On the Life insurance, Paolo, again.

A - Paolo de Martin

{BIO 15930577 <GO>}

Yeah, I think we're still – in terms of where our PGAAP assumptions were set for the two
books, I think we're still healthily in between or below those assumptions in terms of the
mortality trends. In terms of how much that has benefited us, I mean the ability – I don't
know if interpreted your question correctly. But the fact that we bought the books and repriced them, one in 2011 and one in 2013, that has – yeah, it has a tremendous benefit for
us. I mean, to get a sense of it, you just have to look at some of our competitor results as
they come through on the U.S. mortality side. We have very little of those impacts in our
portfolios because effectively, those were considered when we purchased both the
Transamerica book and the Generali book.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, we will not be discomfort – I will not be sitting here being so comfortable about U.S.
mortality if we had originated that mortality ourselves in those pricing eras. We sit here
comfortably because we have priced the issues as we were purchasing those books. In
the price we paid, we had largely priced all the issues that you see coming through our
creditor books.

Q - William Hawkins

4% or 3%, if you hadn't done that.

A - Paolo de Martin

I don't know. I mean those books are, if you look back at pricing era – if you go back at

expected, those pricing eras are doing just bad. I mean you're talking several tens of

Thank you. Our next question comes from Vinit Malhotra of Mediobanca. Please, go
ahead.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Hello. Hi there. Good morning, everyone. Just on the slide 10, the normalized combined
ratio and the man-made relationship, for Victor. Last quarter, I think, Victor, you mentioned
5 point to 6 point as a normal man-made level in a quarter. And from the two numbers of
€32 million and €28 million on the slide, this third quarter looks somewhat similar to that
5% range, but I'm just wondering, I mean, when you say that it should normalize over the
next period or next few years – next year. What normalized level of man-made would you
expect? Still a 5% to 6%, just any thought from this, please?

Bloomberg Transcript

And second question, just on this Solvency II, 6 points of lower solvency in 3Q, could you
just comment on what's driving that? Mainly, you have said macro factors. Is the debt – is a
calling of the debt maybe 2 points driving some of that? And the reason I ask is that one
of the other larger insurers has last week given us a much lower impact in the quarter, and
they have presumably a bit more life hearing than you would've had. I just was just curious.
Thank you.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Well, I think it's extremely difficult to normalize man-made. I mean, that's extremely
complicated. But what I'm saying is we do not see any particular pattern. We see a spike
of a few losses. We had that some years ago, so we do not feel that there is any
particular problem in the portfolio, any pattern, general pattern that should indicate that
this will continue.
So normally, while next quarter, we should see the number of losses coming back to
where they are in normal cases. And basically, what we indicated at the IR Day was an
attritional at 57%, commissions at 24%, while we should be this quarter, if we did not have
those man-made, our attritional would have been a bit better than the 57%, and the
commission a bit higher. So we would have been at 56%, 25%. And we are at 57.5%, 25%.
So, I mean, I think, to me it's just going to come back to 56%, 25% in a matter of a few
quarters.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

I'm digging for questions here at your results. Either your results are too good or you're
being very cautious. It's – normally speak more. It's not a criticism. It's just my – it seems to
be that way. Anyway, as a question, Tianjin was incredibly low for you and you did kind of
say that you're keeping your large losses to within a low number compared to
shareholders' equity, I'm guessing it's 1%. So, maybe you can explain a little bit how come
Tianjin was low and where the 1% is just my imagination or is about right. Thank you.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, I don't know. We do not have any particular reference to percentage of equity. I
mean, we underwrite and then Tianjin, the lowest estimate we have is coming from, well,
the type of underwriting that we develop both internationally and locally in China. So I think
that's in – every company has a different underwriting approach. And then, when a loss
like this occurs, depending on what sort of business you have underwritten, whether
you've written non-proportional cat or whether we have returns of business, you happen
to have the losses distributed differently.
And I think this will happen more and more because, I mean, one thing which is obvious is
that there is more and more differentiation of underwriting opportunities and there is
more and more differentiation between clients in the relationship with reinsurers. So, I
think you will have divergence of impacts of losses between reinsurers just because, well,
the underwriting policies are not the same.
And there are still uncertainties on Tianjin. I think we are giving a best estimate of where
we are. There are uncertainties that remain about that loss in certain areas of contracts in
particular, as well in the loss adjustment itself. But we are not – we don't think that our
figure is – we think that our figure is quite representative of where we are.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

It's true that when you plot the net claim or net cost of Tianjin, related to the premium
income group by group (59:44), equity base group by group, this is a very large variation
(59:49) situation where it does measure as a relative maybe risk appetite, because it's
highly (01:00:00) quite open. So, in this case, we have here certainly at the low part of the
graph, when you relate Tianjin loss to premium income (01:00:13) group. So, to my point
of view, it's kind of increased measurement of the risk appetite group by group, the
quality of the underwriting (01:00:22) and the diversification of the group. So, (01:00:26)
ask us to be more bullish, so we are more bullish now.
We did answer the question why we need to be above (01:00:34) the evolution of the
solvency ratio, Frieder? (01:00:38) able to answer all questions that were asked.

Yeah. It's not for us to comment on how the movements compare to our peers. I mean,
just to mention potential differences, we need to us a full internal model without any
transitional measures. And transitional measures can mitigate the impact of changes on
financial markets and market risks to some extent. So, that could be potential reason, but
then also our portfolio is different, our risk profile and our model is different. So it's hard
to explain the difference that you are referring to.
