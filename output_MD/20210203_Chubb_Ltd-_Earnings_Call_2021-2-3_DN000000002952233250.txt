FINAL

Good morning. As you saw from the numbers, we had a very strong finish to the year with
excellent financial results headlined by rapid premium revenue growth and underwriting
margin improvement across our commercial lines portfolio in both the US and
internationally. A trend, we are confident will continue. We produced very good earnings
and our balance sheet is in excellent shape.
Our fourth quarter results were in context of the historic and unprecedented time we live
in nationally and globally. We continue to face the health, economic, political and social
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic globally, which might now be more accurately viewed
as an endemic and which despite the efficacy of vaccines and therapeutics will likely be
with us for years to come.

Bloomberg Transcript

Before I go further with the quarter, I want to make a few comments about recent events
in our country. We all witnessed the shocking display of demagoguery and insurrection by
a group of our own citizens in our nation's capital in early January. We witnessed a scene
in our Capitol building never before viewed in our country's 200-year history, including a
totally unacceptable display of symbols of hate, bigotry, violence and anti-Semitism in the
halls of Congress.
The incident has left our country shaken and our international image tarnished. Some
members of Congress attempting to subvert the will of the people and stand in the way
of what is largely a ceremonial affirmation of the Electoral College vote was also
unacceptable. At the end of the day, the facts are the facts. All of the independent
institutions we charge with overseeing our election process including the Department of
Justice, the new federal cyber watchdog agency, state and federal courts and state
election officials investigated opined and confirmed there was no widespread election
fraud. Just because you don't like the political outcome doesn't give you the right to make
up your own facts or attempt to subvert our democracy in the rule of law.
This isn't going away and is a wake up call to all of us who care about and love our country.
Now returning to our fourth quarter results. We recorded core operating income of $3.18
per share, up nearly 40% from prior year and net income of $2.4 billion or $5.34 per
share, up over a 100%, and which by the way, was a record.
We produced strong premium revenue growth in the quarter with global P&C net
premiums written, which exclude agriculture up 6%. Our P&C combined ratio of 87.6%
along with very good net earned premium growth produce P&C underwriting income of
$969 million, up 82% while our current accident year underwriting results excluding cats
were even better supported by continued underwriting margin improvement and
excellent revenue growth in our commercial P&C businesses globally. As we continue to
capitalize on more favorable underwriting conditions.
The current accident year combined ratio, excluding cats was 86.4% compared to 90%
prior year. The 3.6 point percentage points of improvement, included 2.8 points of loss
ratio related improvement, which was broad based. And let me give you a better sense

FINAL

of this. Agriculture improved 27 points and then excluding agriculture, the global P&C
commercial lines loss ratio improved about 1.5 percentage points, virtually all as a result of
earned rate exceeding loss cost trend. The loss ratio for global P&C consumer lines which
is global A&H and global personal lines improved 1.2 percentage points. The vast majority
of which was indirect COVID benefit related. Phil will discuss the expense ratio
improvement in the quarter.
To very briefly recap the year that we had an entire quarter of earnings lost to our effort
to reserve COVID to ultimate and a very active year for natural catastrophes, we
produced $3.3 billion of core operating earnings. The full year published P&C combined
ratio was 96.1% compared to 90.6% in '19.

Bloomberg Transcript

The full year P&C current accident year combined ratio, excluding cats was 86.7%
compared to 89.2%, which speaks to our underlying health. And our full year premium
revenue growth is about 5.5% in constant dollar with commercial lines growth of 9.3%. I
mentioned in the beginning, a strong balance sheet. The strength of our loss reserves,
which is the most important part of the balance sheet improved throughout the year.
Consistent with our practices, we continue to recognize bad news early and any potential
good news late. On the one hand, there had been no changes to our P&C COVID-19
incurred loss charge, which we consider adequate to absorb COVID losses that may
emerge.
The vast majority of the charge remains IBNR. On the other hand, we have recognized
only a modest degree the reduction in losses mostly frequency due to the economic
shutdowns. Beyond COVID related, we have also purposely strengthened reserves.
Increasing the strength of our reserves is the prudent thing to do given the uncertainty in
the environment.
Book and tangible book value per share were up 7.7% and 12.2% respectively for the year.
So we'll have more to say about investment income, book value, cats and prior period
development. Turning to growth and the rate environment. As I said, global P&C premium
revenue in the quarter, which excludes agriculture grew 6% comprising 11.3% growth in
commercial P&C and 3.9% decline in consumer lines. The consumer lines result included
negative growth in global A&H and international personal lines and positive growth in
North America personal lines. In the quarter, we continue to experience a strong and
continuously improving commercial P&C pricing environment globally.
In fact, the level of rate and rate of increase was the strongest since this part of the
underwriting cycle began approximately three years ago. I expect the favorable
underwriting conditions to continue. In North America commercial P&C, net premiums
grew 10% and that actually includes a reduction in growth of three points, due to reduced
exposures from the decline in economic activity.
New business was up nearly 12% and renewal retention remains strong at over 95% on a
premium basis. In our North America major accounts and specialty business. Net
premiums written grew over 11.5% while our middle market and small commercial
business grew nearly 8%. Overall rates increased in North America commercial P&C by

Page 3 of 18

FINAL

16.5% with a loss cost trend of approximately 5%. Though it varies up or down depending
upon line of business.
Let me give you a better sense of the rate movement. In major accounts, risk
management related primary casualty, up 7% while general casualty rates were up over
36% and varied by category of casualty. Property rates were up over 30% and financial
lines rates were up over 26%. In our E&S wholesale business, the Westchester, property
rates were up over 23%. Casualty rates were up nearly 29% and financial lines rates were
up over 26%.
In our middle market business, rates for property were up over 15%. Casualty rates were
up nearly 12% excluding workers' comp with workers' comp rates up about 0.5%. And
financial lines rates were up over 20%. In our international general insurance operations,
commercial P&C net written premiums grew 14% in the quarter. Our international retail
commercial business grew 9% and our London wholesale business grew over 32%. Retail
commercial P&C growth varied by region with net written premiums up 17.5% in the UK,
about 16.5% from the continent and over 16% in Asia Pacific while Latin America shrank
14% as a combination of insurance market and economic conditions way on Latin America.

Bloomberg Transcript

Internationally, like in the US, in those markets where we grew, we continue to achieve
improved rate to exposure across our commercial portfolio. In Overseas Gen rates were
up 18.5% overall with a loss cost trend of 3%. Rates were up 17% in international retail and
26% in London wholesale. Consumer lines growth globally in the quarter continues to be
impacted by the pandemic's effects on consumer-related activities. Our international
personal lines business and our global A&H business together shrank 8%.
We expect growth to return and to begin to return in these businesses as the year goes
along. Our North America high net worth personal lines business, what we call Personal
Risk Services, however remains an exception with net premiums up 2.5% in the quarter.
We continue to experience flight to safety and quality in our high-net-worth segment. New
business was up 6.5% and retention remained strong at about 92.3. While we continue to
achieve rate increases of 4.5%.
Our Global Re-business grew its net premiums written about 14.5%. And lastly, in our Asiafocused international life insurance business. Net written premiums were up 25% in the
quarter. In sum, we are in a continuing hard or firming market for commercial P&C in most
all parts of the world. The rate environment in my judgment is a rational and necessary
response to years of underpricing of risk and a more uncertain risk environment today.
Given our years of data and analytics capabilities and underwriting knowhow, we know
what rate we need in order to achieve an adequate risk adjusted rate of return from
underwriting. And that is the objective. Some lines are there while others have a way to
go. Virtually, all of our commercial P&C lines of business throughout the year, have been
achieving rates that exceed loss cost, and so margins continue to improve.
Looking forward, we are off to a very good start to the year in the first quarter, both
growth and the level of rate increase we are achieving look a lot like the fourth quarter.

FINAL

Based on everything we see, the current commercial market condition has lags. My
colleagues and I are confident in our ability to grow our business and continue to expand
margins. And as I said, I expect as the year progresses, our sizable consumer business will
return to growth.
By almost any measure, our company performed admirably and distinguished itself during
the past year and I applaud and I'm so grateful to our more than 31,000 Chubb
colleagues around the globe, whose resilience, determination and dedication have
produced distinguishing results for our clients and shareholders in spite of work from
home conditions.
I also want to recognize our global management team, who lead and reinforce our culture
and discipline are well ahead of our performance every single day. In closing, our company
finished the year with a strong performance and momentum that continues. We are
leaning into the current favorable underwriting conditions and capitalizing whatever we
can get paid adequately to assume risk and volatility.
We are in fact growing exposure. Our people are energized and we have all of the
capabilities in place to grow our company profitably and increase shareholder value. With
that, I'll turn the call over to Phil. And then we're going to come back and take your
questions.

Philip Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

Thank you, Evan. We completed an eventful year with solid financial results and continued
to build on our balance sheet strength, including substantial capital of almost $75 billion,
supported by extraordinary Fed actions our double rated portfolio of cash and invested
assets grew almost $10 billion for the year and now exceeds $120 billion. Our excellent
underlying -- underwriting and investment performance produced very strong operating
cash flow of $2.5 billion for the quarter and a record $9.8 billion for the year.
Among the capital related actions in the quarter, we returned $542 million to
shareholders, including $352 million in dividends and $190 million in share repurchases. For
the year, we returned $1.9 billion to shareholders or 58% of earnings including $1.4 billion in
dividends and $516 million in share repurchases. Adjusted pre-tax net investment income
for the quarter was $924 million and $3.6 billion for the year.
Investment income in the quarter was higher than our estimated range and benefited
from increased corporate bond call activities and greater private equity distribution. While
there were a number of factors that impact the variability and investment income, we now
expect quarterly run rate to be in the range of $890 million to $900 million. Separately,
our policy has always been to record the change in the fair value mark on our private
equity funds outside of core operating income, as realized gains and losses. Instead of
net investment income as other companies do.
The gain from the fair value mark if included in investment income would have increased
adjusted net investment income by $485 million for the quarter and $714 million for the

FINAL

year. Our annualized core operating ROE and core operating return on tangible equity
were 10.7% and 17.1% respectively for the quarter. If we had included in the fair value mark
on our private equity portfolio and our core operating income, core operating ROE would
have been higher by 3.5 percentage points for the quarter.
During the past few quarters, since S&P Global Ratings published their ratings update on
Chubb, management has had discussions with S&P regarding Chubb's track record of
strong and diverse underwriting results and operating performance. This has resulted in
the company updating its capital management policy to calibrate its estimate of capital
adequacy from S&P's AAA level to S&P's AA level. We believe this is sufficient to maintain
our AA rating.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our capital management policy remains consistent with whole surplus capital for both risk
and opportunity. Our undeployed capital on a run rate basis dilutes our core operating
ROE by around 200 basis points. We are also announcing today that our Board has
increased the authorization to repurchase shares by 1 billion. Our total repurchase
program now allows for up to 2.5 billion between January 1 and December 31 of 2021.
Book and tangible book value increased 5.4% and 8% respectively for the quarter and
7.4% and 11.9% respectively for the year. Book and tangible book value were favorably
impacted by after-tax net realized and unrealized gains of 2 billion for the quarter and 2.5
billion for the year.
The gains were principally in our investment portfolio. Primarily from the narrowing of
credit spreads in our corporate bond portfolio, a decline in interest rates and the fair
value mark on private equities. At December 31, our investment portfolio was in an
unrealized gain position of $4.7 billion after tax. Our net catastrophe losses for the quarter
were $314 million pretax or $271 million after tax. The P&C catastrophe losses of $296
million were primarily from a series of severe weather related events globally. There were
no changes to the previously reported estimates of our P&C COVID incurred loss charge
from June 30. We had favorable prior period development in the quarter of $206 million
pretax or $189 million after tax. This included $94 million pretax adverse development
from our legacy runoff exposures, principally related to asbestos. The remaining favorable
development of $300 million is split 70% from long tail lines, principally from accident
years 2015 and prior and 30% from short tail lines. For the year, our net loss reserves
increased $4.3 billion in constant dollars and our paid to incurred ratio was 80%.
The P&C expense ratio was 28% in the quarter with a 70 basis point improvement over
the prior year. About half of the improvement is from the health-related shutdown and the
balance is principally from operating efficiencies. Our core operating effective tax rate was
15.2% for the quarter and 15.8% for the year. For 2021, we expect our annual core
operating effective tax rate to be in the range of 15% to 17%.
I'll turn the call back to Karen.

Q - Michael Phillips

{BIO 21023048 <GO>}

Thank you and good morning. Good morning, thanks for the time. Can you talk about your
ability in times like this with rate so much higher than loan loss trend. Can you talk about
your ability -- programs you have in place, I guess to keep your business sticky and your
retentions high?

Yes. That's better. Please go ahead.

Q - Michael Phillips

{BIO 21023048 <GO>}

Okay. In times like this with rate so much higher than loss trend that you look at. Can you
just talk about programs you have in place to keep your business sticky and keep your
retentions high?

Keeping retentions high?

Q - Michael Phillips

{BIO 21023048 <GO>}

Yes sir.

A - Evan Greenberg

The program -- I'm sorry. Are you saying, the programs we have in place to keep our
retentions high.

Q - Michael Phillips

Yeah. We -- it's very basic blocking and tackling every single day. This is a customer and
client-focused company. And frankly, our communication begins early and is continuous
with all of our clients and customers. The -- we endeavor not to surprise. We explain very
clearly to our customers and clients.
The reason for need for rate increase, how we're running today. The kind of transparency
we give you. We give them a lot of transparency around the loss cost environment,
around our return hurdles, around our appetite for risk. The consistency of the company
has by itself distinguished itself and we've stood out and given and therefore garnered a
lot more credibility and confidence from our clients. Chubb has been consistent in its
approach about underwriting and its need for rate throughout the years, particularly when
we were shrinking. And note when we couldn't achieve what we required to earn an
adequate return.

Bloomberg Transcript

And at the same time, given the rate environment changing, our appetite consistent, we
continue to promote and on the same basis, our appetite for the amount of risk we will
take, the classes of business that we will serve, where we will serve them. All of that is a
well-understood story about us. And finally, what I'd say is, we don't serve them in one line
of business or two lines of business. We serve to them broadly across virtually all of their
needs and the secret we do it on a local basis, it isn't simply that we operate from two or
three hubs, we're where they do business. And where they need to work with us and see
us every single day.
There is no magic sauce about this. It's a day-to-day, year in and year out effort of a
consistent approach to how we do business. And right now, it serves us quite well.

Q - Michael Phillips

{BIO 21023048 <GO>}

Okay, thanks, Evan. I guess on the COVID losses and almost a year out now and that the
early stages, you were one. And then there were number that said that this is going to be
the worst event ever. Some are still saying that, but there is many that had put the
industry losses at a lot lower than what they initially said. I guess, where do you stand on
that and do you think there's any upside to bringing your current numbers that you put up
last year down (inaudible)

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

I'm right where you left me standing. I think the loss to the industry. We had pegged that
loss somewhere in the -- the underwriting loss somewhere in that $70 billion -- $80 billion
range, and I think, it's ultimately going to play out there. Right now, it's at around $35
billion to $40 billion and that number is going to continue to climb. And so far, you've really
focused on BI that you've seen. And BI, I don't think it's run its course. But beyond that,
there are a lot more casualty to come. From D&O to employment practices liability et
cetera and credit-related, and then the other side of the balance sheet as well over time.
So far, we have had a recession that been relatively credit loss proof brought to you by
central banks around the world and government policies. That's not going to last forever,
Page 8 of 18

come.

(Operator Instructions) We will now take our next question from David Motemaden with
Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.

Q - David Motemaden

{BIO 18818634 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hey, good morning. I had a question just on the international consumer lines. And I guess,
pretty encouraging commentary that you expect that to come back as the year
progresses. Evan. I guess one thing that I'm realizing is it feels like the mix shift away from
those consumer lines has had -- it has been somewhat of a headwind to the loss ratios
and to margins overall, over the course of 2020. So I guess, I'm just wondering maybe if
you could size that and then help us think about the positive margin benefit that may have
as the mix shifts moves a little bit back towards that as we get through the course of
2021?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Yes, I -- I'm not sure, you're thinking about that completely right. The consumer lines
depends on line of business within consumer. Are we talking about accident and health,
are we talking about automobile. But it -- in general, runs a lower loss ratio but it runs a
higher expense ratio. We're producing the current accident year in the 80s and the
consumer lines business runs aggregate in that kind of range.
So it's a shift in loss ratio, expense ratio predominantly. Now that varies, which I'm not
going to get into with you and then you're going down the rabbit hole. It varies by region
of the world and international versus domestic. But you really spoke about the
International in that regard. So look, it -- as it comes back, it lifts growth and it lifts
earnings. And it's less of a margin story.

Q - David Motemaden

{BIO 18818634 <GO>}

Got it. That's helpful. That helps, thanks for clarifying that.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

And we were not comparing that to -- I'm comparing that to current accident year ex-cat.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

FINAL

On a published basis. (multiple speakers) On a published basis, it will have some benefit.
I'm not prepared to go into the detail on that.

Q - David Motemaden

Okay. Okay. That's fair. And then I guess just a question on North America commercial. So
we're obviously seeing continued positive rate trend there 16.5 points in the fourth
quarter. I guess my question is, if I look at the current accident year loss ratio ex-cat about
120 basis points improvement year-over-year. That compares to an average rate, I think
that you guys have said over the last five quarters, it's been well above 10%. I think closer
to 13%. So it sounds like it's -- I would say maybe 8 points above trend roughly. I guess, I'm
wondering, what are the moving pieces here on thinking maybe mix shifts that would
explain why we're not seeing more of the rate above trend come through in the loss
ratio?

A - Evan Greenberg

Bloomberg Transcript

{BIO 18818634 <GO>}

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

If you listened to me in the commentary, I spoke about reserves. I also broke down this
quarter's loss ratio margin improvement. And as you heard, it was a greater percentage
of improvement for commercial P&C than there was for consumer lines within global P&C.
And so you are seeing margin improvement. On the other hand, we are striving and will
achieve an adequate risk adjusted return, which says that we're pegging ourselves to
achieve a result like that. We raised the bar and in a market like this, where we're growing
exposure and there is more loss cost uncertainty, as we look forward, COVID and nonCOVID related. We are properly building reserve margin. And at the same time, through
growth and margin improvement and not a small amount, and our current accident year
combined ratio that is world-class. We are delivering tremendous earnings. At the same
time, we're building balance sheet strength, absolutely the right thing to do. And I hope
that answers your question. Then finally, don't be overly simplistic about it than you want.
You got an average loss cost trend. That varies by category of business and line of
business.
And we are also growing and in areas that is to some degree changing our mix right now.
Something else I -- that's proprietary. I'm not going to go into. So that does have an
impact as well to some degree.

Q - David Motemaden

We will take our next question from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

FINAL

Good morning, Elyse.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi, thanks. Hi thanks, Evan. Good morning. My first question, on prior calls, you've also
mentioned the fact that we could see reinsurance rate increases. So January 1, we heard
about a good amount of casualty reinsurance rate increases. So have you -- do you see
that or do you expect to see that cope with some of the pricing momentum that you've
been talking about throughout the commercial line space?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

No, not. Not really Elyse. The reinsurance market in January, which was firm to a lesser
degree than we anticipated. And it was a bit surprising to us both in casualty and short-tail
lines less of an impact.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Would you expect -- when you think about your retention, obviously that's moved by a lot
of different reinsurance programs. But maybe if you were just thinking about North
America commercial, would you expect any significant change in your gross to net
retentions in 2021?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

No. Not significant change targeted in specific areas, we already have changed our
retentions but it is on the margin, we're quite consistent. Remember, we buy reinsurance
both for capacity purposes, where the amount of exposure we take is beyond what we
want to retain on the balance sheet. And we buy a certain amount for volatility protection.
And you know that's pretty steady in how we manage, but there are targeted areas.
Again, something I won't go into in any detail.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. And then one last for me, on the market. You gave a lot of good double-digit price
increases in some instances right well into the double digits across many lines. And then
you also said that there is some lines that have a way to go -- ways to go I believe. So
which lines and I'm assuming that some lines where loss cost is perhaps well above that
5% aggregate. But when you think about your commercial book, what lines do you still
think need a good about of rate increase?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Right. And remember it's to -- we translate combined ratio hurdles from what we consider
to be an appropriate risk adjusted rate of return we should be earning in any line of
Page 11 of 18

Date: 2021-02-03

business. And there are lines of business around the world that have a ways to go in

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yes, thanks. Before I ask my question. Just, I know we've got you for another quarter, Phil,
but I just want to congratulate you on your retirement. I'm just surprised, Evan has actually
let you go. But here's my questions. The first one. Evan. Could you talk a little bit about the
A&H business right now. And, what I want to understand is how coincident is growth in that
business with economic growth? And perhaps may be you can kind of outline for us,
where is the growth more important globally, just start seeing that growth come back in
that line of business?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Yeah, I'm going to give it to you in two very -- the simplest ways. And it's more
complicated than us, but I think, we'll help you conceptualize it. Credit and travel. So it's
not -- so it's not simply economic, it's --

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

It's the shutdown and travel. And imagine, let's take it for a couple of hands, you would
think of travel as simply, okay, retail travel insurance that you sell through travel agents et
cetera or airlines. It's actually a small part of it. Employers, an employer purchased
insurance, where it's really, it's purchased not for employees sitting in the office. It's

purchased because they have employees traveling all the time -- travel accident
insurance, as an example. With travel down and then on top of it economic -- the
economic headwinds. That impacts overall A&H. A major part of A&H around the globe,
whether it's in the United States, Europe, Asia or Latin America.
Credit-related, we have a huge direct marketing book of business and it is principally Asia
and Latin America. And with people taking less credit on one hand. And secondly, not just
tied to credit but marketing to their customer bases, the middle income customer for
supplemental insurances A&H, modest homeowners and householders related. I think on
the credit side as well. Mortgages. With economic activity down that business slows down
substantially. We are seeing signs of it and it is beginning to pick back up, but it has a ways
to go in Asia, in particular, and believe it or not, in parts of Latin America, like Chile and to
some degree in a place -- in places like Brazil.
So this does start to -- and we're seeing it in the first quarter begin a bit in different areas
to pick up. And then, of course, as you go further into the year beginning with second
quarter, you start getting a year-on-year comparison.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

The overall health of the business, by the way, the overall health of the business, very
strong. And this is not like a lost forever thing. The clients remain in place. The distribution,
not only remains in place. But our people have spent a lot of time putting a lot of new
distribution channels in place, new partnerships across the board. And we are very
optimistic that as time goes on, and I just can't pick the time. You're trying to pick the
timing of the health crisis right now. And when does it -- when are we able to around the
world resume travel, economies open up, people leave their homes and get back to
work. That's a -- good luck predicting that. You can't. But what we know is it will over time
heal itself and if it does that, very vital part of our franchise.
It is an excellent franchise in place and we'll get a lot more joy for the effort we got today.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great, thanks. Second question. I missed (inaudible) Phil mentioned the 200 basis points
of drag from your excess capital position right now. I'm just curious, do you think you'll be
able to use that excess capital organically over the next couple of years or do you think,
you'll need to do some inorganic stuff in order to utilize that excess capital or do you
anticipate utilizing it?

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

I anticipate over the next number of years. Next few years, you know I'm a pretty patient
guy. And I expect over the next medium term to put that capital to work either organically
or inorganically.

Got you. Is the market conditions good enough to (multiple speakers)

FINAL

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Chubb remains a growth company. And that's how we see ourselves. And it is
predominantly to begin with the most fundamental shareholder wealth creation indicator
tangible book value. And by tangible book and book over any medium term period of
time, we will continue to grow this company. And our share of the global insurance market
and we view it globally is almost a rounding error. And so there is a lot of scope to grow
for this company and it is both organic and inorganic. And the inorganic things we will do
are things that will complement what we are already doing organically, and will produce
what we think are superior or very favorable return to shareholders.
So we will use the capital wisely. And to the degree, we build surplus capital in excess of
what we require, we will return that to shareholders.

Q - Tracy Benguigui

{BIO 21808177 <GO>}

Good morning. Maybe just piggybacking off the inorganic growth discussion, can you
comment if Chubb had exercised its option to purchase an additional 7.1% stake in Huatai,
which would make Chubb a majority owner. I mean, it seems certain conditions had to be
met that the intent previously expressed. What to do so by year-end 2021. And if so, how
are we seeing the majority ownership milestone change your strategic priorities in China
and impact more broadly?

Okay. All right. So I'll just move on from there. Maybe just to cyber. Congrats to Mike
Kessler on his new cyber leadership role. With a new set of eyes, is Chubb refreshing its
view of cyber risk or is there a secular trends like 2020 ransomware that is prompting you
to revisit Limit and impose self-insured retention. And if you wanted, just add anything
more broadly on terms and conditions.

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Yeah. Mike, who is an outstanding executive and he has been with us a long time. He
wasn't appointed based on market conditions or what we see as the general underwriting
environment. Mike was appointed because he is a great executive. It's a -- it's an
important line of business to us. It has -- it's complex -- it's a very complex line of business.
And Mike brings the skills and the capabilities to manage on a global basis a business like
that. Great opportunity for him and a great opportunity for Chubb. Beyond that cyber
itself is in a state of change and the product is evolving and will evolve.
It's a lot beyond pricing. Pricing is the easy part. But it's -- that the loss environment, which
I've been speaking about for numerous quarters consistently is changing. And so, I'll just
remind everyone. Frequency of loss has been increasing as the world has digitized and
we gave it a huge shove during COVID and work remotely conditions, the world is more
cyber and digitally integrated and that raises both exposure in terms of frequency of loss
but it also raises and continues to raise the catastrophe nature of the product, because of
the interconnectedness of everyone globally.
I have said for a number of quarters that the next pandemic, the exposure that looks like
a virus is cyber related because it has no geographic or time bound to it. We've seen a
number of events over the recent years that give a glimmer of that. So it is complicated
and the product has to evolve to recognize that kind of exposure, both on the frequency
side and the severity side. And we have a fabulous team of cyber experts, who have

been doing this for quite a while. You got at the same time be humble and know what you
don't know. And not over imagine, there is a lot of basis risk in it, even the cyber -- all the
cyber experts are constantly surprised with new Day Zero events and techniques that
emerge. And so, I can on that wrap it up by saying, I can think of no one better to help
lead along with our cyber experts than Mike Kessler. Thank you for the question, Tracy.

We will take our next question from Meyer Shields with KBW. Please go ahead.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Great, thanks, good morning. Evan. I'm going to assume in this question that if the industry
was putting up underwriting results like Chubb would be experiencing great increases to
the degree that we are. So hoping if you could talk a little bit about maybe on the
technology side. The proprietary differences that allow underperformance -- sorry,
underwriting outperformance relative to peers and in addition maybe over the next
couple of years to spend that?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Be careful of one thing, Meyer. Everybody has a different mix of business, a different book
of business. Chubb, we have a balance between middle market and small in the United
States and around the globe and large account and specialty risk E&S. We're a very large
E&S player. We're very large maybe the global leader in major account business. And then
we're a top tier middle market company. All of that goes in, and I was pretty clear that the
level of rate increase we're getting varies by the market area, and then beyond that, it
varies by product area, and I gave you some sense of that. We have years and years of
data and it's not just data, it's been turned into information. And it has taken us a long
time to do that. And to do it properly. And so the management information flow here is so
well connected between the reserving process and the rate making process in a granular
real time way and updated based on loss and loss cost trends and actual in virtually real
time without a lot of lag. And it is something that all of us at all levels have great
transparency and availability to access and that links back with then how we look at what
business are we quoting, what business are we binding and at what terms and conditions.
It doesn't mean that it's all perfect and we don't make mistakes. And given loss cost and
real world about the loss environment that we don't get surprised on the margin, because
things change swiftly here or there, of course, but we react quickly. And finally, what I'd say
to you is, it's no different than this conversation that goes on about, well, how come you
haven't produced more margin, when we're producing outstanding margin and margin
improvement, is that, look at our reserving policy. It's that we recognize bad news most
immediately and we recognize good news over time. The commercial P&C business,
particularly the casualty areas are not for optimists. And I've said this many times. And by
the way, the notion of prior period reserve development.

Page 16 of 18



Company N ame: Chubb L td
Company Ticker: CB US Equity
Date: 2021-02-03

Well, that's a strength, and that's part of being prudent and recognizing slowly when
you're conservative and cautious about a loss cost environment. So it's the data, it's the
technology, it's the knowledge of the people, and it's the management policies and
practices consistently that make the difference.

-- long turn we're not trying to make some short-term killing in our business. And that's
not what it's about. And by the way, we run the company first for our customers and we
run it to deliver them a product at the right price, not take advantage of them in any way.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

No, that's clear. Thank you. Second question. Looking back, after 9/11, I guess the industry
basically reassessed its expectation of terrorist domestically. Are some underwriters
thinking differently about political risk in the United States? Is that a real world issue from a
underwriting standpoint?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Evan Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Well, there isn't really a political risk insurance market in the United States. The United
States given rule of law, and given credit ratings, there has not been true political risk
losses in the United States. And true political risk exposure from what we classically deliver
as a product outside the United States in political risk. And God, help us. I don't expect
that to change. Now, you could ask the question on the investment side of the portfolio
and do we see political risk? I think, we see more credit related risk than we do at this
time political risk.
