Presentation
Jarmo Salonen

{BIO 1860650 <GO>}

Ladies and gentlemen. welcome to this call on Sampo Groups 2013 Full Year Results. I'm
Jarmo Salonen, Head of Investor Relations at Sampo, and with me here at this call I have
our Group CEO and President, Kari Stadigh; Head of B&C Insurance, Torbjorn
Magnusson; and Group CFO, Peter Johansson.
Let me remind you that you can follow this call at sampo.com/result, and also see the
slides that Kari is using, and a recorded version of the call will later be available at the
same address. As has become tradition, we'll start with Kari's presentation. Kari will
highlight the developments in 2013. Kari, please.

Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Thank you. Welcome to the conference call on my behalf as well. When I look back at
2013, I really see a continuation of 2012. In a way, we have a market which is not really
favorable for the ﬁnancial sector. We have low interest rates. We have slow growth. We
have that regulation tsunami still coming on us.
However, even in this environment, Sampo was able to produce excellent results. And
contrary to the normal practice, I will walk through a few slides with you. And I call those

FINAL

slides best ever slides, and there are, of course, many more, but I will show you only the
ones I like most.
If we start with the Group results, I think it's worthwhile pointing out that its results in
euros, EUR929 million, was an all-time high result. And I think also it's worthwhile noting
that the combined ratio was the lowest ever, and also the cost ratio. For me all these alltime high numbers are something to be proud of, and for our team to be proud of. But in
each case, I think it's even more important for our owners that the volatility of our earnings
is so low. So I feel that the quality of the earnings of the long performance, or for high
performance for many years, is really is something we can be all proud of at this end.
(Proﬁt from) life also improved last year, and the underwriting result in Mandatum I think is
interesting, because this was a year when the insurance result, and here I mean the cost -the sum of the cost and risk result was EUR38 million, and that was also an all-time high
number.

Bloomberg Transcript

In Nordea's case, you see the ﬂat development throughout the year, and we could see an
all-time high number in their share price in January this year. I think that now the market in
Nordea's case sees that the shareholder base has become much clearer when the
Swedish State sold out their share holding last year, and uncertainty, which was actually an
overhang for the Nordea share disappeared. Also, I think that the market appreciates now
a determined approach in Nordea's management when they announced their cost-cutting
plan. You will remember that the previous plan was cost-cutting program of EUR450
million, where they had implemented so far EUR200 million, and that was raised now to
EUR900 million.
I think the important number in Nordea's case is that the management has committed
themselves to lower the cost from 2013 until 2015 by 5%, when the earlier guidance was
ﬂat cost development. And of course in the traditional of Nordea, all this will be done
without sacriﬁcing anything on their franchise. So a very positive situation on all three
areas.
If we look then at the outcome from a sample share perspective, our NAV of EUR22.15 is
also an all-time high number. Here, of course, the Nordea share price has signiﬁcant
inﬂuence.
On the combined ratio, I already commented to you that the lowest ever full-year number
was 88.1%, and the cost ratio, 22.8%. And I also commented that we really take pride from
the low volatility in these numbers.
Mandatum continued as planned and is signiﬁcantly more exposed, or concentrating on
the unit-linked market, and unit-linked, as it's under management at EUR4.6 billion, were
also an all-time high number. Unit-linked sales were also at EUR880 million, an all-time
high number in Mandatum Life's case.
The valuation diﬀerences in Nordea are at EUR1.5 billion, that's an also all-time high
number, and I also want to remind you that our acquisition value for Nordea is -- or was
Page 2 of 12

FINAL

EUR5.6 billion. The book value is now EUR6.9 billion. The market value is roughly EUR8.8
billion, and we have received cumulative dividends during our ownership of EUR1.2
billion. So the EUR5.6 billion investment has turned into EUR8.8 billion, plus EUR1.2
billion. That's around EUR10 billion.
A few words about the dividends. You know that we are committed to being a dividend
stock, and given the strong cash ﬂow in our business, we increased the dividend to
EUR1.65. You always ask us about the payout ratio. That payout ratio in this case was
63.7%.
But what I think is more important is that before we pay out the dividend, if we look at the
cash ﬂow to the parent in the six months prior to the dividend distribution, we can see an
internal dividend from last December of roughly EUR485 million. Then we have
announced that Mandatum will distribute the dividend in the First Quarter of EUR100
million, and then we will receive EUR370 million of dividends from Nordea.
That's altogether in the six months prior to the dividend payout, that the cash ﬂow to the
parent of EUR955 million, and the EUR1.65 dividend is altogether EUR924 million. So well
in line with our practice to payout most of the cash ﬂow we received to the parent.
And after the dividend payout, the debt in the parent will be roughly EUR1.5 billion, which
is also a very healthy number, indeed.

That was my best ever list, and I ﬁnish here and give it back to Jarmo.

Thank you, Kari, and Operator, we are now ready for questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our ﬁrst question comes from Mr. Gianandrea Roberti from
Carnegie. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. A couple of questions for me as well. I'll start with non-life. I'll be
interested in hearing your view on competition in general, but not much on competition,
but more of what's going on in the Danish market, where we've seen sort of a
mushrooming of several diﬀerent players that are starting up in the market, and even then
our ﬁrst real aggregate, or some of them seem to be fairly aggressive on the pricing
strategies. If you have any question, I know Denmark is pretty small with you, but at the
same time, you own more than 25% total Denmark. So I'm just curious to hear your view.

FINAL

The second question is related to -- I'm not sure how should call it, I stumbled recently on
a company that is called WaterCircles, and I understand that it is a sort of a If shop brand,
or something like that. I just would like to hear what is this new initiative.
And the last question, although you already partially addressed (inaudible). The dividend
growth of 22% year-on-year, it's not really that gently as you describe it previously, but I
suppose just really a function of the diﬀerent cash ﬂow, and if we continue to expect
Nordea to increase its payout ratio, well, there's only one way up on the dividend, and
then let's see how much about the growth in that point. Thanks.

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Okay. Generally up, in competition general, got very little to say, there's been little change
in the past year. Denmark mushrooming, as you call it, I think what people tend to forget
is that non-life changes gradually and slowly, and we've seen a number of initiatives in all
markets, maybe with the exception of Finland, over the past 10, ﬁve years. Now you see a
few in Denmark they have been able to gain lots of publicity. Let's see if they actually have
1% market share in a year's time, and discuss them then.
WaterCircles is indeed an If brand, and as you may know, we have probably around about
a dozen diﬀerent brands used in diﬀerent situations, most of them in the car dealer
channel. WaterCircles is a brand that we use on price comparison sites mainly in Sweden.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Gianandrea, don't get really too exciting so quickly. We announced the dividend today,
and now you are already extrapolating a few years ahead. So calm down. I think that we
are committed to being a dividend stock, but don't start to interpolate logarithmic curves
or so. I think that our ambition is to regularly increase the dividend as we have done, but
then let's wait 12 months and see what kind of year we have behind us.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

I appreciate that, Kari. No logarithmic calculation. Thanks a lot.

Operator
Our next question comes from Mr. Hakon Fure from DnB Markets. Please go ahead.

Q - Hakon Fure

{BIO 16623060 <GO>}

Yes, hi. Good afternoon. Two questions for me. First on the M&A activity ongoing in
Finland with the Mutual now trying to take full control of Pohjola. Do you expect this to
have any impact on the P&C markets in Finland going forward? And secondly, on your
running yields, with the reinvestment rates you're seeing now, do you see further pressure
on your running yields going forward, or have we seen the trough now? Thanks.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

FINAL

Well if I start oﬀ with the running yields, you have seen that If's running yield is at 2.9%,
and somehow you get the feeling that there we could have seen it bottoming it out, and if
there is a ﬂuctuation up or down, it will not be that signiﬁcant anymore. On Mandatum
where the running yield is 3.7% there is still room to go down in the present environment.
So I would expect the running yield to drop signiﬁcantly more in Mandatum, and whether
it goes up or down in If remains to be seen during the year.
On the M&A I will be (inaudible) but before that I would like just to state that competition
is always ﬁerce, and when someone makes a bigger acquisition, especially if it ties up lots
of capital, normally that calms down the situation, at least for a while, until the entity in
question has regrouped. But I don't know if Torbjorn shares this view, or how do you see
it?

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

To avoid speculation, let me state the obvious, the OP banks subsidize Pohjola's personal
lines customers by 15%. It can hardly get any worse at least.

Q - Hakon Fure

{BIO 16623060 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Operator

Bloomberg Transcript

Our next question comes from Mr. Matti Ahokas from Danske Bank. Please go ahead.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon, two questions from my side as well, if I may. Continuing on the
dividend front, when I look at the calculation part of your view made basically in the
previous years, it's been a kind of cash ﬂow or dividend, internal dividend, payout ratio,
roughly 90%. And this year with the holding company funding cost, I get to almost 100%.
So the question is here that should one expect that the 100% is more the run rate, or the
90%? Maybe if you could kind of bit shed of light on the fact that is the higher payout
ratio for (two then a third bin) more a reﬂection of the increased share price, or something
else?
Then a question I've asked a couple of times in previous quarters, Swede and on the nonlife side seems not to be improving, apparently industrial, Torbjorn, could you shed some
light on what's happening there, and potential future actions you're going to remedy the
situation. Thanks.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

I still think that you can't really draw mathematical conclusions from our dividend. I think
that, I just repeat my earlier statements, we are committed to being a dividend stock, and
some of us like these graphical and beautiful linear things. And if they a little bit jump up
and down, we don't really think that disturbs the linear view. So let's see what kind of cash
Page 5 of 12



Company Name: Sampo Oyj

Date: 2014-02-12

ﬂow we reach this year, and let's make new decisions next spring. But the underlying
commitment is still there.

FINAL

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Sweden, we managed very well in the second half of 2013, and I'm rather pleased with the
outcome. As you remember, we have announced price increases on personal lines, and
basically, we got them through as planned with the sales that we wanted to have.
The other area that has been problematic was industrial lines, where we have been able
to implement price increases. They are not bad. They're quite alright. We had a good
one-one renewal where we had high retention rates, and were able to increase prices by
some 3%. A little bit more is needed, but the second half in Sweden was actually quite
good.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

So all-in-all, Sweden should do better this year compared to last year?

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Super. Thanks.

Operator
Our next question comes from Mr. Paavo Ahonen from Nordea. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Paavo Ahonen

{BIO 6531806 <GO>}

Still a question on the internal dividends, because you have earlier stated the potential to
release capital from Mandatum Life, and then of course now you are saying Mandatum
will pay a dividend of EUR100 million in Q1. So should we understand this is all in terms of
dividends by Mandatum this year, or are you planning still additional dividend from the
life company for 2014?
And the second question is also on Mandatum Life. In your report you are indicating
improved expense result for this year. So just wanted to check, what kind of potential you
see there during the next years? Are we talking about increment of some millions, or how
do you see the potential? Thank you.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Well ﬁrst of all, we have no other plans for Mandatum's dividends this year. I think EUR100
million in the First Quarter is good example of the level we think that it can generate. On
the expense (in quarter show) some of you remember that when I have described

Page 6 of 12



Company Name: Sampo Oyj
Company Ticker: SAMPO FH Equity
Date: 2014-02-12

Mandatum Life as a hedge fund, I have said that the big proﬁt pool cash asset pool is
roughly EUR5 billion.

FINAL

We have been sometimes discussing a 2% margin on that. That's a EUR100 million. Then
we had said that the expense and cost result could produce 10 each. Then we had said
that when the years go by, the management task is to increase that to 20 and 20. Well we
are now at 38, so they have reached what we asked them to deliver.
Here on, of course, their task has not come to an end. They're should improve that, but
we are talking small numbers here. So don't get exaggerated.

Q - Paavo Ahonen

{BIO 6531806 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Operator
Our next question comes from Mr. Blair Stewart from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you. I promise not to ask questions on the dividend, you'll be glad to know. A
couple questions, though. The ﬁrst is on the non-life side. It looks normalizing for, as I
know you like to do Torbjorn, normalizing for large claims, and whether it looks like the
published result was pretty close to the underwriting, which is obviously a very strong
ﬁgure.
I just wondered, given the various movements in pricing and claims costs if it is possible
to improve the underwriting result going forward from here. You've said in the past as
long as the top line is growing you should be able to get the expense ratio down. I just
wonder on the claim side what more can be done.
Then the second question is on the capital position of the company. The economic capital
ratio is very strong, and it's been quite stable as (well carry). And note that the results -they know that Solvency II is becoming somewhat more clear. I wonder if you're prepared
to take a stab at the excess capital position in the company, and what if anything, you're
willing to do about that over the next couple years?

A - Torbjorn Magnusson

{BIO 1863476 <GO>}

On normalization, yes, I don't slight that, that's correct, and (hand) you are correct. I think
the normalized result is not far from the published one. Then with a combined ratio, for
instance, full year in Sweden of 93.5%, you asked me whether we can improve the
underwriting result. Yes, of course. And we will continue to work with that, and I will
continue to work with that until I retire.

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 20728335 <GO>}

Page 7 of 12



Company Name: Sampo Oyj

Date: 2014-02-12

Yes, you're right on the capital side, and if it's actually at all-time high level, which could
be added on Kari's list. But partly also when we look at the internal dividends, we decide
what the cash need is on the parent company level. So there's a bigger part of the excess
capital marked down in it.

FINAL

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

And I could add that I'm not really considering the excess capital as such. That's not on
the table. I think that our main task is to secure the position as a dividend stock, and then I
think that we want to be strong, because historically we have seen opportunities to act
when we have a strong position, and we are not going to streamline this in that sense that
we would like to increase the leverage signiﬁcantly from what we have today, unless there
is some opportunity which meets our expectations, and those kind of opportunities, we
don't see them at all for the moment.
The M&A activity in that magnitude of M&A is non-existent. People are still looking at the
regulation, and people are still hesitant in this low-interest environment.
So let's stay put, and keep the war chest in place, and secure the dividend stream. And
also commit us to growing dividends.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Peter, can I follow up on the economic capital, is there anything that you've seen in the
Solvency II proposals that would lead you to recalibrate your economic capital calculation
anyway?

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 20728335 <GO>}

Not at least in this case, because the more limiting factor will deﬁnitely be the single A
rating requirement, because there we have to use a higher conﬁdence level than 99.5. So
for If it's more a technical exercise, and additional burden on the regulatory side, but for
Mandatum the situation is a bit more diﬀerent.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay, super. Thank you.

Operator
Our next question comes from Mr. Thomas Seidl from Bernstein. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. A couple of questions. Number one, on reserve
releases noted, it's quite a bit lower than usually. Perhaps you could comment what is
driving this. Do you see changes in claims inﬂation, for example? Secondly, although
referring to the capital situation, which looks like (comp double). Do you plan to replace
the expiring debt in 2014?

Page 8 of 12



Company Name: Sampo Oyj
Company Ticker: SAMPO FH Equity
Date: 2014-02-12

FINAL

And ﬁnally, Kari, you mentioned the underlying improvement in life, would you hence see
better life earnings going forward, and raise the guidance? I think it was usually around
EUR100 million net per year. So do you now expect a better performance of Mandatum?
Peter Johansson Reserve releases, once upon a time we thought that 3% and 4% reserve
releases were high. They will always vary a little bit over time. This time I think it's 1.7% on
the combined ratio. They come this time mainly from workers' comp in Norway, and they
will vary a little bit over time. As long as we are more -- have a higher inﬂation of
something, the reserves than the actual inﬂation in society, there will be releases on
average.

A - Kari Stadigh

{BIO 1504152 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

On the capital side, actually, the EUR300 million senior bond that is maturing this year, it
doesn't really impact our capital position, but we most likely will issue a new one when it
matures. On the life company, the underlying EUR100 million from the (with) proﬁt
business, I shouldn't expect it to increase, because you have some megatrends, which are
against us. One is that our with proﬁt liabilities are shrinking, and then you have the low
interest rate environment.
The management activity is actually there to increase the fee-based business, and the
insurance margins and risk margins in order to compensate for the with proﬁt business.
The decrease of the with proﬁt is not only bad news, because of course that ties up
capital, so actually the fact that the with proﬁt liabilities shrink by some EUR200 million
per year, that gradually is caution for us to maintain our dividend stream from the life
company. So both good and negative, but let's be in the middle of the park, and continue
with the same round number.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Our next question comes from Mr. Daniel Do-Thoi from JP Morgan. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Daniel Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Hi. Good afternoon. Two questions from my side, both on the non-life business. Firstly,
you mentioned in your report that you beneﬁted from mild weather during the quarter.
Just wanted -- you to help me quantify the (fujis). Talk us through maybe the impact that
this had across the diﬀerent geographies, speciﬁcally in Norway and Sweden.
Then secondly, if I look in the presentation on slide 34, the gross written premiums in local
currency. Can you just give us a feel for how much of this is driven by price increases, and
by (inaudible), please? Thank you.

FINAL

Mild weather. We actually have -- we've had a number of mild weather Q4s, so it's diﬃcult
to compare, and this time what one can say is that we had some bad weather in Denmark.
The Danish numbers are aﬀected by bad weather. The biggest storm is mentioned in the
report when it triggered EUR24 million. Apart from that, it is slightly beneﬁcial in all
markets.
Then when it comes to volumes, most of the volume increases are from price increases
with the exception of Finland, where half of the increase comes from the acquisition of
Tryg here in Finland.

Q - Daniel Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

(Operator Instructions) There are no further questions registered on the telephone. Please
go ahead, speakers. Oh, hold on a second this came in one question. We have a question
from Mr. Vinit Malhotra from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Thank you. Very quickly a housekeeping thing. The holding company, obviously, the main
(photo time to go to the slops) and could you just remind us if there is any guidance we
can use to model that little better?
And secondly, on the discounting eﬀect on the Mandatum Life, could you just remind us
what you're thinking is, because you do it a little bit every quarter. There's obviously
Finnish assets having, I mean, have it on mind. But why don't you do it one quarter that
we know gives us a view, because if you do it every quarter, then we don't know what's
going on there. Just clarify that, please. Thank you.

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 20728335 <GO>}

On your ﬁrst question on the holding company, if I understood, you wanted to know the
specialties that we had on the funding side, because we reported a positive result in Q4, if
we had Q4 standalone for the holding company, and actually did. The direct interest costs
is EUR50 million per quarter if you take across that. And the moving part (you send) that
we have KKR4 billion worth of loans issued in Sweden, and that brings certain ﬂuctuation
with -- and we haven't hedged that because we are long in kronos on the asset side.

Page 10 of 12

FINAL

So basically, there was a EUR11 million positive eﬀect coming from those loans in Q4. At
the same time when we had another (comprancing) income a negative eﬀect from the FX
in the book value of it.
The other EUR4 million in the FX results, or the total FX results was EUR15 million positive,
and the other EUR1 million comes simply for trading the If dividends that we received, so
part of them were sold for -- what, we made an extra EUR4 million of those. And the
movement in the derivatives position was quite small. That is what we mark-to-market
that's we have swapped out bonds to ﬂoating, ﬂoating rate. And there was another EUR2
million positive in Q4. So net-net, the funding cost was actually EUR2 million positive.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Thanks, because I asked because I was expecting (slopes) movement to be small, and so I
was surprised. Thanks for clarifying.

A - Peter Johansson

{BIO 20728335 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

The other part on the discount rate, yes, we have lowered now again. This is something
that we have been rolling forward, and this is completely voluntary from our side. So there
hasn't been any regulatory pressure. So it's more or less simply because we have higher
liquidity allocation. Our cash position on the ﬁxed income side is growing. So then simply
to bring down the yearly rate for investments to make money also in the coming years.
That's the reason why we have lowered the discount rate. And the discount rate is now at
22.25% for this year, and 2.75% for next year. And most likely, as long as we stay at this low
interest rate environment, you will continue to see us doing this.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Thank you. So this is expected to be a quarterly thing, because most companies otherwise
tend to take one hit for a few years, and then say -- oh, the beneﬁt change every quarter, I
just wanted to know the thinking behind quarterly was this, a medium term hit, if you like.
Thanks very much. Thank you.
