Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Storebrand Quarter One
2018. My name is Anne, and I will be your coordinator for today's conference. I will now
hand you over to Head of Investor Relations, Kjetil Krøkje, to begin today's conference.
Thank you.

[0BZ74J-E Kjetil Krøkje]
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Storebrand's ﬁrst quarter 2018
conference call. My name is Kjetil Ramberg Krøkje, and I'm Head of Investor Relations at
Storebrand. Together with me today, I have Group CEO, Odd Arild Grefstad; CFO, Lars
Løddesøl; and Head of Economic Capital, Trond Finn Eriksen.
In the presentation today, Odd Arild will give an update on developments in Q1. Whilst
the CFO, Lars Løddesøl, will give some more detail on the ﬁnancial development in the
quarter. The slides will be similar to the analyst presentation released this morning and
are available on our webpage.
After the presentation, the operator will open up for questions. To be able to ask
questions, you will need to be dialed into the conference call.
So, with that, I will leave the word to Storebrand's CEO, Odd Arild Grefstad, who will start
the presentation on slide 2.

Thank you, Kjetil. First, let me lead your attention to the forthcoming Capital Markets Day.
We will be in London and host presentations from 9:00 to 12:00 on Thursday, May 31. Go
to storebrand.com/ir to register your attendance or save the date for some webcasting in
your calendar.
Let's move to slide number 3. I'm very pleased to present the group results before
amortization and write-downs of NOK 931 million for the ﬁrst quarter. Savings volume
growth, combined with strong insurance and risk results, contributes to the strong results
in the quarter. One special eﬀect this quarter is a positive non-recurring reserve release of
NOK 149 million due to the completion of the scheme for longevity reservation.
The operating proﬁt in the ﬁrst quarter was NOK 635 million, an increase of 37%
compared to the same period last year. A 17% unit-linked growth and a strong risk and
insurance results, 14% growth in retail bank with improved margins drive the strong
operating proﬁts. The underlying solvency position improved by 5 percentage points to
160% in the ﬁrst quarter before transitionals. Including transitionals, the solvency ratio was
165%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Then, let's move to slide number 4. This (00:03:13) illustrating our twofold strategy, which
we have been implementing through the ﬁve – past ﬁve years. It is pleasing to see that we
are really delivering on both sides of the strategy in the ﬁrst quarter with strengthened
capital position and growth within savings.
Let's move to slide number 5. In the movement of the underlying solvency position, I want
to highlight three main elements. Firstly, the market movements and especially the
increase in the Norwegian 10-years rate of 31 basis points resulted in an increase of 5
percentage points in the ﬁrst quarter. Second, EIOPA provides quarterly update on VA
and equity stress, as well as implementation of a new UFR of 4.05% in this quarter. In sum,
these changes give a 3.5% increase in the solvency.
Lastly, operational performance. This reserve generation in this quarter gives a 3% point
increase, of which half is reserved for expected dividends. In addition, the acquisition of
Silver and a net reduction in subordinated debt reduces the solvency by 3.5 percentage
points and this then moves us back to a solvency position of 160%.
The eﬀect of the transition rules are reduced from 16 percentage points to 4 percentage
points during this quarter. Increased interest rates and increased VA reduces the Solvency
II liability and that also then reduces the value of the transitional rules. The eﬀect is in line
with the reported sensitivities from the last quarter.
Moving to slide number 6. Talking about development in the sensitivities. We see that the
sensitivity for increased solvency due to an increase in the interest rate is reduced. The
reason for this is that we now are at a point of time where paid policies are becoming
more proﬁtable, and this will increase the lapse risk on the Solvency II.
Regardless, limited immediate solvency eﬀects, increased interest rates are very positive
for Storebrand, and that is because increasing the interest rate gives reduced investment

risk and increased resource and solvency over time to customers and owners.

FINAL

Then, let's move to slide number 6. With that – number 7, actually. With the acquisition of
Skagen, the group is well positioned for a strong growth in the Norwegian individual
savings markets. In Q1, the group acquired the remaining 9% of the shares, and this was
ﬁnanced with liquidity from Skagen AS.
As for the integration update, we have decided to converge into one common
operational platform using technology solutions from both Skagen and Silver. We have
also decided to establish a common institutional distribution platform.
Lastly, on the onboarding of Silver customers, this has been a very successful onboarding
and they are now all being fully served on Storebrand's platform.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to slide number 8. I also want to comment on development of the Swedish
business SPP this quarter. The development has been an impressive turnaround. From a
situation a few years back with a very weak administration results and volatile results due
to ALM mismatch, we now see solid results contribution. And on top of this, we see
growth within the Swedish business with 22% premium growth from the same period last
year due to strong sales and positive net transfers.
Moving to slide number 9. The strong growth in savings continues with a growth in unitlinked reserves of 17% and in asset management of 18%. On a quarterly basis, growth is
dampened due to weak ﬁnancial markets both for equities and bonds, as well as the
weaker Swedish krona.
Retail lending has grown with 14% with margin improvements, and growth in insurance is
weak. But reserves are strong and we are in the process of implementing new growth
initiatives that we expect to give positive eﬀects going forward.
And with that, I'll give the word to Lars.

Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
Thank you, Odd Arild, and asking you to turn to page number 10, key ﬁgures. The group
result is good at NOK 931 million. The operating result at NOK 635 million is somewhat
above the normalized level that we have previously communicated around NOK 550
million per quarter. This is primarily driven by good risk results and ﬁrm cost control.
As a reminder, we record performance fees in the fourth quarter. And this quarter and the
fourth quarter will normally be a lot better than the ﬁrst three quarters as you can also see
from the graph. Financial return in the ﬁrst quarter was quite satisfactory despite turbulent
equity and bond markets. Good returns in real estate and credit markets get the proﬁt
split (00:09:28) in Sweden and acceptable returns in company portfolios.

FINAL

The special item in the quarter of NOK 149 million relates, as Odd Arild alluded to, to
reserves for longevity. Just to remind you of the history here, in 2013, Storebrand started a
plan to strengthen longevity reserves by NOK 12.4 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we
set aside NOK 1.4 billion in a one-oﬀ charge to cover the Storebrand part of the base.
In the fourth quarter of 2017, Storebrand ﬁnished a reserve strengthening well ahead of
plan. And the ﬁnal allocation of reserves done on each individual contract which
happened in March this year, it became clear that we had set aside too much on the
capital for this purpose. As a consequence of good risk management and buﬀer-building
throughout last year and the last few years, we were able to return a total of NOK 149
million to company proﬁts.
As Odd has commented on, the underlying solvency margin improved in the quarter. As
you can see from this graph, the capital requirements fell with higher interest rates and
lower equity stress, while the solvency capital increased due to operating performance.
Customer buﬀers in Norway fell with equity markets and bond markets, and we now
beneﬁt from the risk management and buﬀer-building done last year. Cash earnings per
share ended at a strong NOK 1.69 in the quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning over to the next page, 11, fee and administration income is NOK 1.220 billion in
the quarter, of which NOK 107 million comes from Skagen. The insurance result is strong,
primarily driven by run-oﬀ gains from previous years.
The operational cost line includes NOK 110 million from Skagen, which means the Skagen
contribution is a negative NOK 3 million in the quarter. In the ﬁrst quarter this year,
relative performance in Skagen has been weak, and we've not had to set oﬀ too much for
fund manager bonuses. This far in April, performance has picked up signiﬁcantly, and we
may have to settle for bonuses in the second quarter.
However, we are not allowed, under IFRS, to take corresponding proﬁts into income
before at the end of the year. So far this year, we have earned but not booked NOK 55
million in performance fees from Skagen and Delphi.
Adjusting for the Skagen costs, the Storebrand cost level is well under control, and we
conﬁrm our cost targets for the year. Financial results and risk result life includes NOK 149
million reserve release from longevity.
Amortization is positively impacted by a technical accounting eﬀect relating to the
acquisition of Silver. Normal amortization charge will be NOK 105 million per quarter. Tax
has been estimated to 16% in the quarter and normalized tax charge will be around 20%.
Turning over to page 12, this picture shows the same results split into the business areas
savings, Insurance and guaranteed. Savings proﬁts continue to grow according to plan.
Insurance results are strong in the quarter and so much stronger than we expect going

Page 4 of 11

forward. Guaranteed include NOK 149 million longevity proﬁt but show underlying
resilient proﬁtability despite being in long-term run-oﬀ.
And that concludes our initial remarks and we open up for Q&A.

FINAL

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. I can see there are questions already coming through, and the ﬁrst one is from
Matti Ahokas from Danske Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. It's Matti Ahokas here from Danske. Two questions, please. Firstly,
regarding the development of the assets under management, they were down quite a lot
from NOK 721 billion to NOK 707 billion. So, it is a function of were there any outﬂows or
it's just a function of the market movements altogether?

Bloomberg Transcript

And then, a small clariﬁcation on slide number 13 where you say about the fees earned
not booked to NOK 55 million. So, if everything would continue as is, it will be NOK 210
million booked in the fourth quarter with no impact on cost. Did I understand this
correctly? Thanks.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Yes. On AUM, that's a consequence of a positive contribution from the Silver funds and a
negative translation eﬀect of the similar size coming from the exchange rates, the change
from Norwegian to Swedish kroner, so which has been 6% in the quarter i.e. all of the
funds we have in Sweden translated into Norwegian kroner are 6% or worth 6% less in
Norwegian kroner. In addition, comes turbulence in ﬁnancial markets where both the
bond market and the equity market as well. There is also a limited – continued outﬂow in
Skagen, which is expected with (00:15:04). But as I said, the performance in Skagen is
picking up nicely now so that may be reversed later on. So, that's the main components of
the change.
On the fees earned but not booked, that is a performance fees that I mentioned in my
comments earlier that where we are not allowed to book performance fees before they
are sure are secured at the end of the year. However, as I mentioned, we have to book the
estimated performance bonuses to the portfolio managers on a running basis.
Therefore, if performance is great one quarter, you have to set up both for bonuses to
portfolio managers, while we cannot take into account the fees earned but not booked
before the end of the fourth quarter. So that creates some volatility in the reported results.
The NOK 55 million consists of NOK 16 million from Delphi and NOK 39 million from
Skagen. And there is – you cannot just times that by 4 to get the ﬁnal number because

Page 5 of 11

that would be typically what was tied through the year. Hopefully, it will go up to a larger
number than you mentioned, but it can also fall to a lower number.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

FINAL

Got it. Very clear. Thanks a lot.

Operator
And the next question comes from Peter Eliot from Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead.
Your line is now open.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you very much. I just want to follow-up on that tech question from Matthew, ﬁrst of
all, and I'm just wondering if you can quantify the SKAGEN outﬂows at all. And then I had
some questions of my own. The main area actually was on the insurance operations,
obviously very impressive cost ratio, 3 percentage points below last year. I'm wondering if
you can just comment on how sustainable that is.

Bloomberg Transcript

And also on the composition of the reserve releases which seem to have come from all
three divisions. And ﬁnally, on insurance, the premium, the quarterly disclosure shows
disability premiums up 20% on quarter one last year. But overall, you're showing simply
sort of talking about ﬂat. So I'm just wondering if you could square that number.
And then if I am allowed to add one more, I was just a little bit confused by the
sensitivities you showed on the solvency on slide 6, speciﬁcally on the equity sensitivity
which has gone up a lot although you don't seem to have increased your exposure a little
bit in Sweden, but it doesn't really account for the increase. And also on the UFR, I mean, I
would've thought you're already accounting for 4.05. So, I'm surprised that there is
sensitivity to that and I'm surprised it doesn't get worse under 3.65. I'm sorry if there are a
lot of questions there. Yeah. Thank you.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

(00:18:23) just from a – just from the – really clarifying on the sensitivity on our side on – for
the solvency ﬁgure. Let me consolidate UFR. It's a cycle. It should become 3.9% in the
chart. Sorry about that. I think that you should clarify the question.
On the equity sensitivity, actually last quarter, the equity sensitivity was quite low because
the (00:18:57) capital during the year. So, we could actually (00:19:06-00:19:16) stress
once more. Now, it really have fallen (00:19:21) the free cash ﬂow. Now (00:19:21) as the
equity stress has actually starts to (00:19:27) so other elements (00:19:31) So, there isn't
(00:19:37).
If you go up for the (00:19:43) on the insurance side and the growth and – we see
payments for own accounts increase in the disability line. This is due to (00:19:56)
products last year on a lower level which has now come up at more or less normal run rate

Page 6 of 11



Company Name: Storebrand ASA
Company Ticker: STB NO Equity
Date: 2018-04-25

with all the signs coming in. This was already – when you look at the (00:20:07) during the
year last year, and that's the diﬀerence between the two metrics being (00:20:14)
payments, which is more forward-looking in nature.

FINAL

On the (00:20:23) take that, Lars?

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Could I just say – sorry, it's quite a bad line. I'm not sure if it's only me, but I'm struggling
to understand everything you're saying. Apologies if it's just me. But I can follow up oﬄine
if that's the case. Sorry.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Yeah.

Operator
Sorry. This is the (00:20:47) operator. It is, when the second person is talking, there is – I
think he's sitting a little bit far away from the microphone. If you just move a little bit closer
and we can see how it sounds. Otherwise, I think it's come through clear. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

And, Peter, the Skagen actual was NOK 2.3 billion in the quarter. And on insurance costs,
we have – we constantly manage the cost level. We will continue to do so. I'm not able to
give you any concrete guiding on further development although I think we need to
maintain it in the area of 15 basis points in order to be competitive, if that answered your
question.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Yeah. Maybe just a quick follow up on that, I mean, obviously, the improvement has been
quite signiﬁcant from sort of 18 to 15. So I'm just wondering are any one-oﬀs in there or I
mean is there any reason that we should sort of expect that sort of revert to the previous
level or to stay on the current – I mean I'm just wondering if there are any one-oﬀs
basically in either number.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
On the cost in (00:22:05) area?

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Yeah. I think what you'll mainly see there is the allocation to savings from insurance and it
reﬂects the actual investments and the margins (00:22:17) used in the business. So it's not
a one-oﬀ. It's actually a reallocation of cost compared to last year.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
Page 7 of 11



Company Name: Storebrand ASA
Company Ticker: STB NO Equity
Date: 2018-04-25

FINAL

You see that we have somewhat lower cost on both the (00:22:28) business and on the
insurance and somewhat higher cost on the savings area due to the fact that there you
see more resources on the savings area as we speak. I also want to just add onto to the
Skagen because the net outﬂow is €2.4 billion. But the good thing is that we see quarterly
inﬂow in Skagen and is still on the high level on that €3 billion on a quarterly basis here.
So, that is of course very important also going forward.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

And if I may add an additional comment on insurance and growth, we work – as you are
very familiar with there are a number of diﬀerent product lines here and we work quite
hard to strengthen growth in all of the diﬀerent product lines. So there is sales within
SMEs, small and medium size enterprises on group life and similar products, it's growing
strongly this year which will come into eﬀect in the next few quarters. There's also
initiatives on P&C and on health insurance that will gradually pick up growth in this area
throughout the year
and even with a higher FX (00:23:41) next year.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Great. Thank you.

Operator
The next question comes from Blair Stewart from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your
line is now open.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thank you. Good afternoon, gentlemen. A couple of questions, ﬁrstly, just on the unit
linked savings segment in Norway, I noticed that just looking at the fee line was
unchanged despite the addition of silver which slightly surprised me. I think you
previously indicated that silver would add I think NOK 60 million, 6-0, on a full year basis
(00:24:16) NOK 15 million a quarter. It's quite a surprise that the fee line wasn't higher and
the cost lane went up. I just wonder if you can explain that. You did mention some margin
pressure, but is there anything else going on there?
Secondly, just relating to the higher interest rates and one comment that Odd Arild made
in his introductory remarks, is there any likelihood of proﬁt sharing re-emerging in the
paid-up books in any signiﬁcant way?
And ﬁnally, again, on the higher interest rates theme, is there any diﬀerence or any
changes to your asset allocation over the last quarter and how is the expected investment
return evolving? You used to show a slide giving the expected investment return over the
next few years. You stopped giving that. It was possibly something you'll return to the
Capital Markets Day. But I just wondered generally how that was evolving. Thank you.

FINAL

Blair, I'll start with the unit-linked savings in Norway. The funds from Citigroup came in
during February. So therefore you have – the balance is up by the whole amount but the
income is only up by one month of income. So that will gradually improve both the
margin and the absolute income in the coming quarters.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
On the cost side, there has to be a reallocation of cost to the areas that are, where we use
more manpower these days which is in the savings area. It started with ASK and I guess
last year and we continue to focus more on savings and pension, therefore the cost to this
area, allocated cost to this area is somewhat higher. And I should mention in the same
context that we do not have deferred acquisition cost on this, the way we account for cost
in Norway. So we take all of the cost upfront while the revenues will come in later. So
therefore, you will see some cost ﬂow planned on these initiatives.

Bloomberg Transcript

When it comes to increased interest rates and proﬁt-sharing, it's of course, we can expect
earlier proﬁt sharing when you see a pickup in interest rates. And there is also diﬀerent
portfolios when it comes to paid-up policies and some of the portfolios starts to add high
above the capital. But there is always of course a trade-oﬀ in the risk management area
versus building bunkers or starting taking out proﬁt sharing.
I also like to mention that there is discussion and (26:56) in Norway now, also with our
regulator and the Ministry of Finance to lift, add some of the elements of the paid-up
policies to make get a better product, both for customers and the companies and it is
possible and do some changes when it comes to the (00:27:11) interest rate guarantee
and also the ﬂexibility of building up buﬀers and use of buﬀers. So hopefully, that also will
have a positive impact that can increase the opportunity to start proﬁt-sharing somewhat
earlier.
When it comes to asset allocation, there's not been any major changes to the asset
allocation
allocation, there's not been any major change with asset allocation during Q1. In the
supplementary information package table (00:27:42) on expected return over the next 12
months. I can also assure you that we will (00:27:51) Capital Markets Day updated slides
on this.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. I'll just come back to the discussions that are happening at the
government level on the paid-up books. Is it just the removal of the annual guarantee?
That was something that has been talked about for years. Is there anything else in
discussion?

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

There's a lot of elements in discussion actually and some of them from the labor
organizations. It's more about also the state to take more of the risks when it comes to
better policies to ensure that you have, over time, a better – well, a better common comps
to pensions for people because you see, of course, with allocation we have for paid-up
policies today. And it will be a real loss for the pensioners going forward and that is being
obvious for many in Norway as we are now seeing these paid-up policies for the
(00:28:52) is growing. And I think the most realistic element is about (00:28:57) building,
is about all the interest rate currencies and that will also be very helpful.

Yeah. Thank you.

The next question comes from Jonny Urwin from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is now
open.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hello. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two for me. So ﬁrstly, looking at the roll
forward of the (00:29:31) there was – there's limited improvement in own funds this
quarter despite decent level of proﬁtability. So, could you help us bridge that gap?
Obviously, the accrued dividend will take up part, but I just wondered what the driver
was.
And then, secondly, we can see from (00:29:55) today that the regulator in Norway has
become a little more active on capital models. Are there any risks to your model from
potential changes from here, or is it a company-speciﬁc issue to consider? I know at least
part of it is. Thanks.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

On the latest one, I – we have not seen anything around the (00:30:19) report today. We
have been busy with our own. But there is no news around our remodeling. It's been of
course no hope, and for a while, we have had discussions about it with the regulator and
there is no, as we can say, outstanding issues when it comes to modeling we are
reporting. (00:30:50)?

A - Operator
When it comes to changes in (00:30:53) actually a bit more complicated than what it
might sound like in the ﬁrst place. First of all, decreased equity markets and increased
home prices have, to some extent, lowered (00:31:12) from the non-European business
(00:31:16) down from that part of the book. Then, on – also (00:31:26) own funds, it's
surplus value of bonds at amortized cost and also that during the quarter just to increase
their interest rates again. I guess that's the two main explanations for any additional
eﬀects on Sweden.
