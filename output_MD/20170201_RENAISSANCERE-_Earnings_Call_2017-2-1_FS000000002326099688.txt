Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks, Peter. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. RenaissanceRe
performed well in 2016 against the backdrop of a challenging market. For the year, we
grew book value per share by 9.4%, and tangible book value per share plus accumulated
dividends by 11.4%. Also for the full year, our return on equity was 11%, and our operating
return on equity was 7.8%.
Our results were driven by several factors, including the pricing environment in the
reinsurance business, loss activity, reserve releases, and movement in interest rates. By
focusing on our core strengths, superior risk selection, client relationships and capital
management, we executed well against a difficult and rapidly evolving market. We have
strengthened our operating platforms globally, developed deeper relationships with
clients, brought more efficient capital solutions to market, and exercised underwriting
discipline in building a diverse and profitable portfolio of risk.
I look forward to 2017 with confidence knowing that our teams have all the tools,
relationships and capital to successfully execute our strategy. Though we continue to face
challenging market conditions and evolving industry landscape and heightened
macroeconomic uncertainty, our platform and team are well-prepared to serve our clients.
Overall, I believe the challenges of 2016 will continue into 2017.
The pricing in our market continues to be pressured by capital supply increasing at a
faster rate than demand for reinsurance. At the most recent renewal, in general, rates
and property cat were down, but the reduction was smaller than in prior renewals, driven
by the same over supply of capital and relatively flat demand.
In Casualty and Specialty, reinsurance terms were relatively flat, but we began to see
some rate competition in underlying books being ceded that required careful
underwriting and monitoring. Our advantage in such an environment has always been our
ability to identify relatively well-priced individual risks and construct an attractive portfolio
against the market average. Our growth portfolios are often managed and optimized as
we match our risk with the most efficient sources of capital. Our ability to execute this

FINAL

process consistently and seamlessly has helped establish RenaissanceRe, a first call
market for our clients.
Most recently, we raised additional capital in Upsilon and created Fibonacci Re, which
demonstrated our ability to respond to changes in the market and deliver a more optimal
solution for our clients. Partially, as a result of pricing trends, we have also seen a wave of
consolidation in our industry in the past few years. Consequently, many of our clients have
grown in size, expanded their capabilities, and demonstrated a need for broader and
more sophisticated solutions from the reinsurance market. We welcomed this trend, and
view these changes as additional opportunities to serve our clients in more ways.
We acquired Platinum in 2015, integrated the company quickly, and developed some new
products on our unified RenaissanceRe platform early in the consolidation wave. Today,
40% of our clients are now served by all three of our underwriting platforms. For us,
moving quickly and early, and anticipating that larger clients would have new risk needs
was a strategic imperative, marked but not limited to our acquisition of Platinum.

Bloomberg Transcript

We're also operating in a period of heightened macroeconomic and geopolitical
uncertainty. The new administration in the United States has signaled several changes to
economic policy that could have wide-ranging impacts on the insurance and financial
services industry broadly.
Additionally, we have already seen interest rate volatility that has affected the results of
insurance companies across a range of businesses, including life and property, casualty.
Today, our customers want to do more with us. And the growth we choose to pursue will
be disciplined and built around a framework of adding value to clients through
underwriting.
Finally, I believe our reputation, experience and long track record of partnership in the
capital markets will continue to enable us to source the most efficient capital that earns an
attractive return for our investors, who provides optimal underwriting solutions for our
cedants.
I will provide a few more details on the opportunities we're seeing in 2017 later in the call.
But first, I'll turn the call over to Bob for a look at our financials and our new segment
reporting approach.

Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. As we mentioned on the third quarter
earnings call, we have presented our fourth quarter results under new reportable
segments: Property and Casualty and Specialty. In connection with the move to our new
segments, we committed to providing transparency into our Lloyd's platform and
catastrophe underwriting results for a period of time.
This information is now provided in our fourth quarter financial supplement. In the 8-K we
filed in early December, we provided historical underwriting results under the new
Page 3 of 24

FINAL

segments back to 2014. We hope you found this disclosure useful, and we believe our
new segment presentation will provide you better transparency into how we manage and
measure the performance of our business.
Moving on, I'll provide you an overview of our consolidated results for the fourth quarter
and full year, and outline a few key themes before turning to our segment results. For the
fourth quarter ended December 31, 2016, we reported net income of $69 million or $1.69
per diluted common share, and operating income of $190 million or $2.92 per diluted
common share.
We generate an annualized ROE for the quarter of 6.3% and an annualized operating ROE
of 10.8%. Our book value per share increased 1.3%, and our tangible value per share
including accumulated dividends increased by 1.8%. Underwriting income was $104 million
and we reported a combined ratio of 71%. For the full year, we reported net income of
$481 million or $11.43 per diluted common share, and operating income of $339 million or
$8.03 per diluted common share.

Bloomberg Transcript

As Kevin mentioned, we generated an ROE for the year of 11%, and our operating ROE
for the year was 7.8%. Our book value per share increased 9.4%, and our tangible book
value per share, including accumulated dividends, increased 11.4%. Underwriting income
for the year was $386 million with a combined ratio of 73%.
As noted, the fourth quarter capped off another profitable year for the company despite
a moderate level of insured catastrophe losses during the year. We also experienced a
rise in interest rates in the fourth quarter, reversing some of the unrealized gains we
booked earlier in the year. Our equity portfolio continued to perform well and partially
offset the unrealized losses in our bond portfolio for the quarter.
For the quarter and full year, we recorded a net negative impact from Hurricane Matthew
of $44 million after giving effect to the redeemable non-controlling interest in DaVinci.
Now, as a reminder, net negative impact includes the sum of estimates of net claims and
claim expenses incurred, earned reinstatement premiums assumed and ceded, lost profit
commissions, and the offset by the redeemable non-controlling interest in DaVinciRe.
Given the magnitude and recent occurrence of Hurricane Matthew, meaningful uncertainty
remains regarding losses from this event and the actual net negative impact from this
event will likely vary from this estimate.
During the fourth quarter, we also recorded favorable development reserve of $87
million, with $67 million in our Property segment and $20 million in our Casualty and
Specialty segment. Favorable development in our Property segment was driven by normal
course reviews of large losses that reduced our estimate of expected ultimate losses on
certain large events and a number of other smaller weather events in the U.S. from recent
years. In our Casualty and Specialty segment, actual reported losses came in better than
expected on attritional net claims and claim expenses.

FINAL

Now, let's shift to our segment results beginning with the Property segment, followed by
Casualty and Specialty. During the fourth quarter, our Property segment gross premiums
written were up 19% relative to the fourth quarter of 2015, driven by our other property
class of business. The fourth quarter generally is light in terms of renewals for our
Property segment. Included in gross premiums written in the Property segment for the
fourth quarter of 2016 was $9 million of reinstatement premiums associated with
Hurricane Matthew.
For the fourth quarter, the Property segment generated underwriting income of $100
million and a combined ratio of 45%. Impacting the underwriting result was a reduction in
operating expenses and favorable development on prior accident years of $67 million, as I
mentioned earlier. Offsetting these items was net negative impact to the Property
segment underwriting result of $49 million associated with Hurricane Matthew before
giving effect to the redeemable non-controlling interest in DaVinci.

Bloomberg Transcript

For the full year, our Property segment gross premiums written increased 4% over the
year, reflecting growth in our other property class of business, partially offset by continued
soft market conditions in property catastrophe. As a result, managed cat premiums were
down 5% for the year. Included in property gross premiums written and managed cat
premiums for the year were $21 million of reinstatement premiums related to a number of
U.S. weather events, the Fort McMurray Wildfire and Hurricane Matthew.
The Property segment generated underwriting income in 2016 of $363 million and a
combined ratio of 50%. Included in our year-to-date Property segment underwriting
results is a net negative impact of $101 million associated with losses from a number of
U.S. weather events, the Fort McMurray Wildfire and Hurricane Matthew.
For the fourth quarter, our Casualty and Specialty segment gross premiums written were
down 7% relative to the fourth quarter of 2015. The main driver for the decrease in the
quarter was a reduction in premiums in the credit book, which had several large multi-year
deals incepting in the fourth quarter of 2015.
Recall that we booked a premium on mortgage deals at inception. However, they tend to
have a longer duration and are consequently earned over a period of 10 or more or years.
This book can be influenced by a small number of relatively large transactions.
In comparison to the decrease in gross premiums written, net earned premiums in our
Casualty and Specialty segment were up 2% in the fourth quarter. The Casualty and
Specialty segment generated underwriting income of $3 million, with a combined ratio of
98% in the fourth quarter.
For the full year, our Casualty and Specialty premiums are up 35% from a year ago,
reflecting continued growth in the mortgage reinsurance and the inclusion of Platinum
results in our financials following the close of the transactions in March 2015.
As we have grown our Casualty and Specialty book, we have increased the use of
reinsurance to manage our assumed risk and enhance overall returns. Consequently, net
Page 5 of 24

Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2017-02-01

FINAL

premiums written in Casualty and Specialty were up 17% for the year compared to the
larger increases in gross premiums written previously noted. For the full year 2016,
underwriting income in Casualty and Specialty was $21 million, with a combined ratio of
97%.
Now, turning to investments, in the fourth quarter, we reported net investment income of
$47 million, comprised mainly of interest income from fixed maturity securities of $39
million and net investment income from our alternative investment portfolio of $10 million.
Our strategic investment portfolio, managed by our ventures unit, recorded gains, and we
continue to be satisfied with the long-term fundamentals of the companies we own.
For the quarter, the annualized total return on our overall investment portfolio was about
flat at negative 0.2% due in large part to mark-to-market losses on our fixed maturity
investment portfolio as interest rates rose in the fourth quarter. Strong returns in our
portfolio of public equity investments partially offset the impact of rising rates.

Bloomberg Transcript

For the full year, our investment portfolio generated a total return of 3.5% compared to
0.9% in 2015. Our investment portfolio remains conservative with respect to interest rate,
credit and duration risk, with 89% allocated to fixed maturity and short-term investments
with a high-degree of liquidity and modest credit exposure. The duration of our
investment portfolio remained relatively short at 2.4 years and is consistent with recent
quarters. The yield to maturity on fixed income and short-term investments was 2.1% at
December 31 compared to 1.8% at September 30.
Finally, I'd like to note that our capital position remains very strong, with modest leverage
and efficient access to capital through multiple sources. For the full year, we repurchased
$309 million of our common shares. And looking across the spectrum of our managed
balance sheet, we kept DaVinci flat, continued to raise capital on other select areas
through Upsilon, Medici, and our newest venture, Fibonacci Re.
Our capital management actions reflect a quickly evolving market, and we believe we
have developed a unique agility to deploy capital where it is needed most, and remove it
from areas where it's not earning a suitable return. In short, RenaissanceRe continues to
match well-structured risk with the most efficient forms of capital across several balance
sheets and capital sources.
As we head into 2017, we are confident that our ventures team is actively building our
relationships with high-quality, long-term investments, as well as looking for new strategic
transactions that can enhance our underwriting franchise.
In closing, I would be remiss if I didn't mention it. Since my arrival last August, I continue to
be impressed with the caliber of talent at RenaissanceRe and appreciate the ongoing
support throughout the organization that has ensured a smooth transition of leadership in
the finance team as we close the books on 2016. We have a deep bench, not only on the
financing but throughout the company, with the necessary resources to continue to
provide superior customer relationships, superior risk selection, and superior capital
management in 2017 and beyond.

And with that, I'd like to turn the call back to Kevin.

Kevin J. O'Donnell

FINAL

Thanks, Bob. I will divide my comments between our Property segment and our Casualty
and Specialty segment, starting with the discussion of the 2016 results and then moving to
the January 1 renewal and opportunities in 2017. After that, we'll open it up for questions.
As we discussed last quarter and as Bob mentioned, we revised our reporting segments
to Property and Casualty and Specialty to give you greater transparency into how we think
about our business. Our Property segment includes our catastrophe excess of loss
business and other property. Included in other property is property written on either a
proportional or per risk basis, the property component of our regional multiline business,
and E&S property insurance written on our Lloyd's platform, all of which were previously
reported as part of either specialty or our Lloyd's segment.
I should point out that our Property business is also exposed to catastrophic events,
although to a lesser extent than our catastrophe book. For the full year in 2016, we grew
our Property segment marginally in a tough market. This growth came from our other
property business, which grew significantly, although from a relatively small base.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our other property business is predominantly written on our U.S. and Lloyd's platforms,
and demonstrates how the strategic choices we have made over the last several years
have developed into increased opportunities. Our catastrophe book was down year-onyear as we either reduced or exited business that no longer met our return hurdles.
Any growth in this market is an achievement. We're able to write more business by
moving from the transactional to the strategic, increasing ties with our clients, and
continuing to act as a trusted advisor across multiple lines of business. We are proud to
have a value proposition that extends beyond price as our clients and brokers recognize
the importance of our problem-solving capabilities and our ability to match risk with
capital. They also appreciated the expertise provided by our scientists at WeatherPredict,
and the integrated solutions we can offer through our Lloyd's platform and our various
joint ventures to help them grow their business.
Moving to the January 1 renewal, my comments will primarily address the catastrophe
excess of loss market as most of the renewals are in this line of business. Property rates
continued to decline. In the U.S., rates were down by about 5%. Rates in the international
market were down somewhat more than the U.S., while retro prices were down
somewhat less. The relative outperformance of retro is the result of several new
programs being placed.
Despite the price reductions, we grew our Property segment at January 1. This growth
came across the board in both our catastrophe and other property business in the U.S.
and internationally, and in assumed retro. This growth was driven by both new
opportunities and growth on existing lines. What is particularly rewarding is the fact that
we were able to identify attractive opportunities on each of our platforms.
Page 7 of 24



FINAL

Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2017-02-01

Growth in the Property segment was augmented at January 1 by the expansion of Upsilon
Re and the creation of Fibonacci Re, and we anticipate that we will continue to help this
grow over the year. If you recall, last year, we shrank Upsilon Re, which is our collateralized
reinsurer, as opportunities were limited. In 2016, we saw increased client demand and
heightened investor interest for retro, and were consequently able to grow Upsilon.
Fibonacci Re is our newest vehicle and has helped us bring additional capacity to
Renaissance Reinsurance clients in the U.S. for more remote property risk. One new
opportunity worth noting both due to its size and its potential is the NFIP flood reinsurance
purchase. We were a significant participant on this program, which demonstrates the
appetite of the private market for flood risk, and which, going forward, could see
considerable expansion.
In 2017, we anticipate that our Property segment will be up slightly, with the growth in our
property business more than offsetting the expected decline in catastrophe. We believe
we can grow our other property business as our expanded platform and strategic
approach to clients will continue to provide us new opportunities.

Bloomberg Transcript

Another area targeted for growth is our regional multiline business where there continues
to be significant opportunities. We see the significant portion of our property risk, which
allows us to optimize our portfolio further, even with deterioration in rates. After adjusting
for retro purchase and the use of joint venture vehicles, we retained roughly half our
gross written premium in the Property segment. As I have said before, this may look
expensive in a low cat environment, but we believe this is the right strategy for our
portfolio.
Within our Casualty and Specialty segment, we write various classes of business. These
include traditional casualty lines such as general liability and professional lines, the casualty
business written through our Lloyd's platform, and the casualty aspects of our regional
multiline businesses. Casualty and Specialty also includes financial and credit business
such as our mortgage reinsurance book and trade credit.
Additionally contained in this segment are specialty lines such as marine, surety, terrorism
and cyber. Previously, our Specialty segment had certain proportional and per risk property
business, which has been moved to the new Property segment for increased
transparency. The Casualty segment now represents more than half of our business
globally, and has grown into a sustainable franchise that is core to our ability to meet client
needs. For the year, we grew our Casualty and Specialty segment almost 35%, with
growth coming across all of our platforms. This growth broke down to be about 25%
growth in Casualty lines, 50% growth in our mortgage book, and 10% growth in Specialty
lines.
There were three general drivers of growth for the year. The first driver was increased
signings on existing programs where clients look to consolidate their panels. The second
driver was the writing of additional lines of business with existing customers. And the third
was from specific strategic initiatives such as helping clients expand to new lines of
business, and developing a marine and energy book at Lloyd's.

FINAL

At the January 1 renewal, conditions were consistent with recent experience, with rates
declining slightly and terms and conditions generally remaining stable. Overall, ceding
commissions were flat. Clients with attractive results probably got a little more ceding
commission, and conversely, those with weaker results probably got a little less, which
demonstrates that the market is showing discipline in response to cedant performance.
In 2017, we believe there will be some opportunity for modest growth in our Casualty and
Specialty segment, although we do not anticipate the same pace of growth as we
experienced in 2016. For example, given our leadership position, we expect to be first call
for new opportunities in the mortgage space. Much of our growth in this book, however,
has come from legacy business. So, future opportunities will be more constrained. It bears
repeating, however, that due to the long tail nature of our mortgage book, the premium
we have already written will continue to earn over several years.
Another area of potential growth will be in marine and energy reinsurance at Lloyd's.
We've been diligently building capabilities in this area and are hopeful that we'll be able to
grow this book. We also anticipate growth in our commercial multiline business run out of
our Chicago office, and U.S. Casualty business written out of New York.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the other hand, we continue to monitor certain lines of business for signs of price
competition such as D&O and the accident and health business. Similar to our Property
segment, we executed our gross to net strategy in Casualty and Specialty, with ceded
purchases remaining fairly consistent during the quarter and for the full year. We currently
cede approximately one-third of our premiums in this segment.
While we find the Casualty and Specialty business attractive overall and diversifying to our
portfolio, we nonetheless make significant retro purchase on this book for three reasons.
First, it helps us maximize shareholder value by enhancing our overall risk-adjusted return
profile. Second, it allows us to maintain our leadership lines such as mortgage as we can
deploy larger limits. Finally, our gross to net strategy helps us transform risk income into
fee income. We have seen significant demand for our Casualty and Specialty ceded
programs, which we believe demonstrates strong market validation of our tools and
capabilities in underwriting casualty and specialty.
I was pleased with our team's performance in the fourth quarter and throughout 2016 as a
whole. Across both of our segments, we continue to deepen our relationships with key
clients and expand our ceded program to improve the capital efficiency of our portfolio.
We also continue to leverage existing platforms and resources in order to manage
expenses and optimize operational efficiency. Going forward, we will continue to execute
our strategy, maintain our underwriting discipline, and drive growth in areas we find
attractive.
Thanks. And with that, I'll turn it over to questions.

Your first question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.

FINAL

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Thank you and good morning. First question is on the – Kevin, you mentioned last year
that some of the Atlantic hurricanes might be overdue over time, but then we had
Hermine and Matthew, and seems now that losses was not big enough to really moving
the pricing to the positive territory. I just wonder, in your opinion, what could turn the
pricing.

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Really, what a large hurricane can do is kind of ratify the normal system of capital within
our business where premiums are paid and return to clients through losses. So, I think
what we need is some sort of shock loss in the system, and it doesn't necessarily mean to
be of X size or in X location. It really is something that people are surprised to be paying.
So, it's my belief that a much smaller New Madrid earthquake can have as profound a
market impact as a very large Florida hurricane. So, I think it's really about just having more
losses and more of our premium returned to the buyers through losses or some other
mechanism.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. And then on the capital management front, you guys didn't purchase any shares in
the fourth quarter. But for the full year, you actually returned more than you earned. I just
wonder is that sort of 100% payout ratio still reasonable assumption for 2017.

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

Thanks, Kai. That's a good question. As I've mentioned before, nothing's changed
regarding our philosophy or our approach to capital management. Our framework
remains the same. We'll always favor allocating capital to the businesses where the
opportunities make sense and returning capital to shareholders over time when it's
appropriate.
It is, I think, critical to remember that this is not a quarterly or an annual event, but a longterm commitment. It takes into account how our business is evolving over time, and the
timing will depend on a number of factors, including business opportunities, I would say
the profile of our company, as well as liquidity profile.
Now regarding guidelines for returning capital, we don't have a set dollar or calendar or
targets for returning capital, nor do we have really an operating benchmark that we would
action against. As indicated last quarter, we do take into consideration net income
available to shareholders, but that's just one of many factors we got to consider.
Let me close with the fact, there is no single metric we use to benchmark our capital
levels. As you look back over our history, you'll see that we've demonstrated that we've

Page 10 of 24



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2017-02-01

really been good stewards of our capital and returned over $1 billion over the last three
years.

FINAL

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. That's great. Lastly, if I may, is a market question like on U.S. tax reforms. Some
argue that U.S. insurers' tax rate could go lower, but some of the global offshore
insurance companies' tax rate could go higher. What's the potential implication for
RenaissanceRe?

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

Look, there's a lot of – as Kevin mentioned, there's a lot going on in the legislation in the
U.S. There's much discussion, and I would have to say there's a lot of uncertainty, but
we've been watching this very close, keeping an eye on what's happening with the Ryan
Bill, the Neil (31:17), all those things, they're moving parts. And as you've seen, there's a lot
of volatility. But what we will say is we have comfort in our platform that gives us a lot of
flexibility and we'll react accordingly as we see that.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Great. Well, thanks so much.

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks, Kai.

Operator
Your next question comes from Amit Kumar of Macquarie. Your line is open.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 16979665 <GO>}

Thanks, and good morning and congrats. Maybe a couple of quick follow-ups and then I'll
re-queue. Just going back to the broader discussion on cross-border taxation. Yes, it's too
early days in terms of what's going to happen, but if you were to sort of think this through
and talk about the planning, do you think that RenRe is – obviously, the company is
morphed, would be able to address any potential changes in terms of re-domiciling
operations, or do you think you'll be taking pricing action at that point if some sort of tax
reform does go through?

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

There's a lot of broad things to consider. And I hear what you're saying. We're looking at
all of these different sort of perspectives that we continue to hear in the market. We do
have a flexible platform. We do have the ability to make adjustments to react accordingly.
And, yeah, in some scenarios, you do see that there could be significant impact to the
end consumer, but these are all things that are being drawn out in the scenarios that are
out there, and it is too early to make a call. But there are a lot of things being circulated
that could have, in some cases, a significant impact; in other cases, not as much.

FINAL

And just to amplify Bob's comments. I feel really good about the investments we've made
over the last several years, which have been strategically important for our business. But
investing in the U.S. platform and continuing to grow the Lloyd's platform, Singapore and
other things, provide additional flexibility to the platform, which will serve us well going
forward.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 16979665 <GO>}

Got it. Yeah. That's, I guess that's what I was looking for. The second and final question
also goes back to the broader discussion on capital management. Assuming the tax
discussion heats up over the next few months, could there be a likelihood that you'd
probably take your foot off the gas pedal at that time and say, let's see how this situation
evolves, or is that a separate discussion based on your excellent capital strength? Thanks.

Going back to what I said, I'll give Kevin an opportunity to say a couple of comments here,
but it really looks that our framework hasn't changed. We still are looking at buybacks as
our means of returning capital. And you're right, there's a lot changing in Washington, in
the U.S. administration, has a lot of volatility.

Bloomberg Transcript

Where it lands could have an impact or not have an impact on how we look at our
deployment of capital, too early to tell. Again, we're going to sit back and watch, and still
proceed to return capital over time, not really set against any benchmarks. I don't know,
Kevin, if you want to add anything?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
I think that's exactly right, Bob. I think you're focusing on – and a very important variable,
which is what the legislative changes may be and how they can affect us. That's a singular
component of how we think about deploying capital and managing capital, and it may
inform how we ultimately invest in our business. But the process that we have of first
deploying into our business and then thinking about ways in which we can return excess
capital to shareholders is exactly the way we'll approach it, and an important component
of that will be legislative changes with the new administration.

Your next question comes from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.

FINAL

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi. Thank you. A few questions. First off, Kevin, in your remarks, you mentioned when you
were talking about the January 1 renewals that you guys found opportunities to grow in
cat and other property. But then you also, in your kind of full year comments, you marked –
talked about a decline in catastrophe. Am I not tying those two thoughts together, or did
you grow at January 1 and you expect the cat business to decline as we move throughout
the year?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
I think that's exactly right. We did see a couple of opportunities, which allowed us to
expand our catastrophe writing at 1/1. I think that the guidance I'd point to is our belief is
over the course of 2017, our cat book will be down, but less than the 5% it was down from
last year. So, that means that going forward, we do anticipate continued rate pressure
and possibly some reduction by us.
Offsetting that, though, is we think we have increasing opportunity in our other property
business. So, I think our Property segment will be up marginally, but it will be kind of a yin
and yang with property cat down and other property being up slightly.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. In terms of share repurchase, just another question, is there a certain
valuation where you, guys, take a pass on repurchasing stock? And then also, as you guys
have slowed down on the share repurchases, I mean we haven't seen any repurchase
since the summer, is – do you think, in a way, are you also holding on to capital for
potential M&A? I mean, how do you balance where your stock is trading versus kind of
holding on to capital for M&A opportunities down the road?

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks, thanks, Elyse. It's a good question. I'll go back to kind of sort of my
response to Kai here and looking at – really, nothing's changed in what we've – our
framework on how we look at allocating our capital. The first order of the allocation is
going to be to the development and growth of our businesses. We'll look at that. We'll
return excess capital, but we've got many things to consider out there. We don't look at
the metric. Share price is important, but also, a lot of other things are important, and what
we're – being able to deploy it into the business, what's a risk for us. Just a lot of factors,
Elyse, that we look at. And again, no set benchmark. And we feel that over time, we've
been a good steward of our capital. As I mentioned to Kai, we've returned over $1 billion
over the last three years.

Okay. And then, if I look at the total Casualty and Specialty kind of current accident year
combined ratio, backing out the reserve releases, you guys are running above $100
million, I guess about $110 million for the fourth quarter, $105 million for the full year. I
mean, as we think going forward, that book will grow somewhere, but how do you think
about the margin profile? What kind of combined ratio do you want to – do you envision
that book running at either in 2017 or just over time?

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

Well, thanks for the questions. It's a good opportunity to get some comments out there.
And this is a – the Casualty and Specialty is, you look at it, is a longer-tail business that's
out there. It takes longer. And looking at it in a quarter or a single-year timeframe is
probably not the best perspective to look at it. What you – we look at it, it is the longer tail
aspect, the attritional nature of it. Some of these pan out over years. Obviously, we think –
we feel good about the book. And on a current accident year, you can see on a full-year
basis, kind of what you want to look at on a relative basis is it's got about a point when
you think about it in that context. But again, this is something that takes time to develop,
and we really haven't seen any trends at this point.

Q - Elyse B. Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. And then, one last question, if I may. As we think about just higher interest rates,
what's the delta between the new money yields and your portfolio yield? And how do you
think – do you think we can see, given the rise – the recent rises in interest rates, a little bit
stronger investment income in 2017?

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

That's a great question, Elyse. Here's how I kind of look at it when I think about the
investment portfolio, and some of my comments are just reflecting back from what I said.
A couple of sort of data points is that we ended the year with 2.1% yield, it was 1.8% in the
third quarter, so that started ticking up. And you got to remember, we do really have a
very liquid portfolio duration of 2.4 years, nearly 90% is in shorter, fixed maturity and liquid
security. So, it gives us a lot of flexibility that we have out there. So, with that being said, I
feel good about our prospects for 2017, our ability to adapt to where the market may take
us. And we also have a strong equity portfolio as well, too.

And your next question comes from Quentin McMillan of KBW. Your line is open.

Q - Quentin McMillan

{BIO 19411547 <GO>}

Thanks very much, guys. I just wanted to touch on the overall underwriting. It looks like the
accident year combined ratio to the core margin was down about 450 bps, and that's
coming obviously from the two factors of both price declines, as well as the mix shift to
Page 14 of 24



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td

FINAL

the portfolio towards the Specialty and Casualty. And I was wondering if you could help us,
in 2016, sort of how much of that maybe came from one bucket versus the other on kind
of a broad brush statement? And secondarily and kind of connected with that, how far
along are we for that drag for Casualty and Specialty before that starts to sort of
normalize?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Can I just ask a clarification? I'm not sure what you mean by the drag on Casualty and
Specialty and normalizing.

Q - Quentin McMillan

{BIO 19411547 <GO>}

Sure. What I mean is that the combined ratio of that business is naturally going to be
higher than your – the run rate expected combined ratio is naturally higher than your
property cat portfolio. So, I'm talking about sort of the drag as the mix shift moves more
towards Specialty and Casualty. Are we at sort of a steady state now with the portfolio
being 50/50 or could there be some more drag in the first half or even through 2017?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Okay. Let me just kind of frame how I think about our combined ratio, and then I'll try to
zero in a little bit on the questions that you have. So, starting with Property, our Property
segment loss ratio or combined ratio will increase. That is how property cat is as it's
normally been, and that's going to be really reflective as to whether there's events or not.
But on the other property line, there'll be attritional losses, which will come in as a
component of the overall segment. And it'll be transparent, it'll be something that will
change the combined ratio on that side.
Going over to Casualty/Specialty, I am, again, breaking it down for the combined ratio
between our underwriting expense and our loss ratios. I look at our loss ratios and it's
been reasonably consistent over time. I'm pleased with the way the triangles are
developed, and I'm not seeing any trends that are alarming. On the acquisition cost,
acquisition costs are relatively elevated, but reasonably flat. So, looking at it from that
side, I think it's reasonably stable.
The second question you're asking is to an optimal combination between how much
Property and how much Casualty and Specialty, we don't have an optimal target for that.
We're constantly looking at how to change the profile of our business. An important
component of that balancing is our ceded. So, for many, many years, we've been active in
capital management on our Property Cat business, and increasingly, we're active in capital
management through ceded and other protections on our Casualty and Specialty
business.
So, it's a little bit more of a convoluted way to think about it, but we think it's the
appropriate way for us to structure our portfolios. There is no target mix. Our combined
ratio will rise for the reasons I talked about and it's an outcome, but we feel good about
that book knowing the fundamentals beneath that are different than property cat.

Q - Quentin McMillan

{BIO 19411547 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. It's really helpful. Thank you. Secondly, just for clarification, in terms of your reporting
structure, you guys are going to continue to report both property cat and property other
going forward, or will property other start to disappear eventually, and it'll just be sort of
the Property versus Casualty and Specialty segment reporting?

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

Well, I think that's a good question. As we laid out earlier when we talked about this, right
now, we've got our Property, which includes property other and catastrophe, because if
you go back to the third quarter call when we talked about this, we committed to showing
catastrophe as a separate standalone given the significance of it. And we also committed
to, for a period of time, showing the Lloyd's platform, and that's in the supplemental
disclosures that you can see in the – in what we distributed yesterday.

Q - Quentin McMillan

{BIO 19411547 <GO>}

So, it will be one bucket eventually?

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

No. That's not what I said. I said we look at – we committed to showing catastrophe
separately from other property as part of the segment.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Quentin McMillan

{BIO 19411547 <GO>}

Okay. Great. And just sort of in the other property, it looks like the loss ratio and just the
loss cost was elevated, and obviously, part of that, I think, was probably coming from
Hurricane Matthew. Could you help us – how much of Matthew, of the $50 million, was
bucketed into property cat versus property other because the loss number looks fairly
elevated in 4Q? Just on a modeling question.

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

Yeah. Most – I mean, most of – as you would expect, most of our losses on Matthew
would have been reflected in the catastrophe side of the Property aspect. There's a little
bit I talked about that spills over into Property and then Casualty and Specialty, but we're
talking about the majority, 90-plus percent was in the catastrophe side.

Q - Quentin McMillan

{BIO 19411547 <GO>}

Then, is there a reason, the $36.5 million of losses in property other? It just seems like a
higher number versus the run rate of that segment for what you gave us in the 8-K.

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
I believe most of that is actually the attritional, because the other thing to look at is what
we're writing in that other property book is exposed to per risk losses, so there's some
activity there. But also, with the regional book we're writing out of the Chicago offices, it's
not necessarily Matthew, but it could be the Southeast tornado outbreaks and the
Oklahoma earthquake. It could be smaller Midwestern events that is probably more likely
Page 16 of 24



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td

to impact that than some of the Florida events. But per risk in the proportional books
written elsewhere might have more Florida, but the Chicago book will be more
Midwestern.

Good morning, everyone.

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

Hey, Josh.

Q - Joshua D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Hi there. So, I was just trying to understand the preferred share issuance in Upsilon? And is
that a netting out of capital or a netting in of capital?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
There's a lot of movement in the disclosure about capital coming in and out of Upsilon.
The net result for us going into 2017 is Upsilon is bigger than it was in 2016, but not as big
as we've had it at different times in the past.

Q - Joshua D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

And with the combination of Upsilon plus Fibonacci, are you materially larger than you
were one year ago or you're in the same zip code? Can you sort of frame how much
capital you're working with compared to a year ago?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Yeah. So, one, let me comment, I think there's more opportunity over the course of the
year for both Upsilon and Fibonacci. Right now, I would say we're between $200 million
and $250 million up on those two vehicles in a ballpark range of committed capital to the
vehicles.

Q - Joshua D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

And can you describe a little bit the different appetite of each of those vehicles?

Sure. Upsilon is a vehicle we've had for several years. It was originally targeted to write
capital intensive retro at reasonably exposed levels. It has morphed in size and it's
morphed in appetite. It is still more directed towards retro, but it participates higher up in
the capital stack, hence, the reason for our shift in appetite.
Fibonacci Re is something when we were speaking to our clients, we realized that they
had increased appetite for high-quality, top end cover. So, we were able to put together a
vehicle to bring that capacity to them mostly in contemplation or in complement to large
participations within RenRe Limited. And importantly, Upsilon Re is worldwide and
Fibonacci is U.S. only.

Q - Joshua D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

FINAL

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
It's hard to point to specific wins from that, but I would say is as our customers
consolidate, I think they've become a lot more sophisticated in thinking about the
synergies with their books and how they're managing their placements. With that, it leads
to two things. One, they want to consolidate their panels with people who can add value
beyond capital; and secondly, they want to trade with people on a more composite basis.
So, with the changes that we've made, I think we're in better position to continue to serve
them. So, net-net, I think it's probably a benefit. We do obviously look for opportunities to
take advantage of the fact that we're only a reinsurer and not competing with them, as
many of these are around the insurance businesses, but it's hard to point specifically to
wins.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Okay, great. And then next, I'm just curious, you mentioned opportunities in the marine
and energy market, kind of getting some growth there in marine and energy reinsurance
market. My understanding is pricing has probably stabilized in that market, but still at
pretty low levels. Why the attractiveness at this point? There's plenty of capacity there,
too.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Yeah, I agree with all your observations. I think we are not looking to write an index of the
marine and energy market. We have built good tools. We have good relationships. We're
looking to come in, in a pretty targeted way, and we're coming in with our eyes wide
open. There's full recognition, that particularly on the insurance side, it's a very
competitive market and a lot of that translates to the reinsurance side. I do think there's
some opportunities there and we're going to leverage into it slowly.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Okay, great. And then just last question. Historically, you actually provided what the credit
part of the Specialty and Casualty business is. Are you going to provide that going
forward or you not, just because it's easier from a modeling perspective to do that?

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

That's a good question. It kind of stems back to how we manage the company and the
segments. While there's several classes of product lines like credit, we really don't
manage them separately. And the fact of the matter is, they have similar characteristics,
but – and separating them kind of from a fully-loaded basis would be inconsistent with
how we look at them. But now having said that, we are planning to have a further
premium breakdown in our K that gets filed later this month.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Great. Great. Just because the earned premium part of that can make it a little

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Hi. Thank you. I guess, first, if I could just follow-up on the Fibonacci question. Will it – for
financial reporting, will it look similar to Upsilon and that we'll see a sort of managed cat, if
you will, gross and most of it comes out net other than – or will look different than Upsilon
does and maybe look more like DaVinci?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
My understanding is Fibonacci is not consolidated.

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

No.

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
I think it'll look a little different.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Robert Qutub

{BIO 15269353 <GO>}

Yes, it's a variable interest, but we don't have a controlling interest, so it will not be
consolidated.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

So, therefore, like Upsilon, we'll see them in managed cat or not even there?

was hoping you could talk a little bit more about that. I guess, the very little bit I read
about that sounded like, frankly, the rate online wasn't that great because it was sort of
the first time out. And it's maybe more about putting something down the road, but it
didn't sound like the returns on that were so hot. Is there anything you can clarify on that?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Yeah, I think, firstly, I'd like to just point out that I think it's thematically good for risk to
reside in the private market because the conversation we're having now is a really
important conversation, which is, is it priced appropriately for the risk being ceded. I think
for that type of risk against the capital that we have, it was appropriately priced. I do
believe it will grow over time, and I believe the input and the exchange between the
private market, the FEMA and the NFIP will be extremely valuable in how to think about
setting appropriate actuarial rates going forward.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Okay. Is it fair to say it's probably a higher combined ratio than typical cat?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
I think there's two pieces to that question, is what is the standalone return and what's the
marginal return. Marginally, within our portfolio, I can say it was great.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Sure. That makes sense. Okay. And then my other one's on the tax. Hypothetically, as you
said, there's a lot of different ways this can play out. But if there were an outcome that
made it worth your while to write more business on your U.S. paper, how difficult is that? I
mean, obviously, I assume a lot of it – you probably keep as little capital in the U.S. today
as you can and keep more than in Bermuda. How easy would it be to restructure that to
put more capital into the U.S. and are there any costs to doing that?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
I – so, there's a couple of questions there. Firstly, we've got a fully functioning platform in
New York, and we're proud of the fact that we recently – we're upgraded with our U.S.based balance sheet, so we have a lot of flexibility as to how to underwrite business
there. Your second question is how do we put together, a capital structure that's optimal. I
think a lot of that's going to need to be determined depending on what is changing within
the tax codes in the U.S. over the next several months. I think we're in a very good spot to
Page 21 of 24

Q - Sarah E. DeWitt

{BIO 18946247 <GO>}

I wanted to ask you a question about the demand for reinsurance longer term. If U.S.
corporate tax rates were cut, the spread between the prime reinsurers' tax rate and the
Bermuda reinsurers' tax rate would be more narrow. Would that make reinsurance a
relatively less efficient vehicle and less attractive on the margin?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
I think there's a lot of speculation that we'd have to make to kind of map out a full
scenario. In general, I don't think that's the case. I think one – reinsurance provides a lot of
advantages beyond just tax and earnings. I think the way I would look at it is something
we're going to have to solve over time, but it's not – I don't look at the tax rate between
insurance and reinsurance as gating issues to whether the demand will rise or fall.

Q - Sarah E. DeWitt

{BIO 18946247 <GO>}

Okay. So, you wouldn't expect then, incrementally less demand on the margin?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
I think a lot of it is going to depend really on what happens, but I don't think tax rate, when
people are looking at their top five reasons to buy, I'm not sure that they're looking at the
relative spread between the tax rates as one of the important elements of it. I do think
there's potentially, if there's more tax generally in the system, there's more expense in
the system, but that will be uniformly applied whether it's insurance or reinsurance.

Sure. Thanks.

Operator
And this concludes today's Q&A portion of the call. I now turn it back over to Mr. O'Donnell
for some brief closing remarks.

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Thank you, everybody, for participating in today's call. Before I close, I'm sure many of you
have seen the news that Todd Fonner will be leaving us on March 31. Todd joined us
shortly before these September 11 terrorist attacks, and he's been a great contributor
from the very beginning. He's advanced our thinking beyond just investments and the
treasury function, where he's mostly dedicated his time. And he's always been willing to
help in areas around the company. I will miss Todd, and I wish him nothing but continued
success and future happiness. And with that, I'd like to say thanks again and look forward
to speaking to you in a couple of months.
