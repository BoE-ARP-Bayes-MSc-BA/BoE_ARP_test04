MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Gabriella Nawi
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures

Alan D. Schnitzer
Business Highlights
Operating Income, ROE and Combined Ratio
• We’re very pleased to finish 2015 with another strong quarter
• As I’m sure you’ve seen, we reported operating income of $886mm, or $2.90 per share, and operating return on
equity of 15.8%
• That caps off another terrific year with:
• Operating income of just over $3.4B
• Operating income per diluted share of a record high $10.87

• And operating return on equity of 15.2%
• Our underwriting results across the board remain strong, as you can see from our combined ratio of 86.6% for the
quarter and 88.3% for the year

Domestic Business and Bond & Specialty Insurance
• In Domestic Business Insurance, consistent with our marketplace objectives, we achieved a record level of
retention in the quarter with positive renewal rate change
• In Bond & Specialty Insurance, we generated an all-time best underlying combined ratio of 80.1% for the year
• Broadly speaking, the market dynamics in the commercial insurance marketplace continue to be remarkably
stable

Personal Lines and Agency Auto
• In personal lines, Quantum Auto 2.0 continues to meet our expectations
• In Agency Auto, we had y-over-y policy in force growth of 8% in Q4
• And as you can see in the webcast, that’s the sixth consecutive sequential quarter of increasing PIF count
• Those of you who have been following our Agency Auto story know what a success it has been
• We’re also pleased to be seeing an impact from the success of Quantum Auto 2.0 on our Homeowners business,
and you’ll hear more about that from Doreen
• Jay Benet will have more to say about our current investment results, but I’ll just note that we have delivered
pretty exceptional returns on equity for quite some time, notwithstanding, all the headwinds in the investment
arena
• Historically, low interest rates, the decline in energy prices and volatility in the equity markets just as
examples from this quarter
• This speaks volumes about our ability to select and price underwriting risk and the strength of our insurance
franchises

After-Tax Net Investment Income and Underwriting Margin
• Just as a data point, our after-tax net investment income is about $1B lower in 2015 as compared to its high in
2007
• On the other hand, our after-tax underlying underwriting margin is about $1B higher in 2015 than it was at its
low in 2011
• Particularly to the extent that fixed income yields remain low and that seems like the outlook for at least some
time, and with capital finding its way into the largest end of this business, expertise in generating underwriting
returns and having strong franchises in the small and middle marketplaces with meaningful barriers to entry will
really matter

Capital Management
• Turning to capital management, consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy, we returned nearly
$1.2B of capital to our shareholders in the quarter and nearly $4B during the year

• The long time consistent strength of our results sits behind our capital management strategy
• Just as we have for nearly a decade, we will continue to right-size capital and invest thoughtfully in the business
• Thanks to that strategy, we’ve now returned close to $35B of capital to shareholders since the middle of 2006,
when we started our share repurchase program

Leadership Transition
• Let me take just a minute to comment on the leadership transition
• What I suspect many of you want to hear from me is where do we go from here
• As I’ve explained to our leadership team, our challenge is this: to take today’s summit and make it tomorrow’s
base camp
• I’m confident that we already have the right strategy in place to do that, and we’ve got the right team to execute it
• We’ve been executing it; we understand it, and it has been remarkably successful
• It’s this team’s strategy

Investments
• Delivering superior returns over time will continue to be our North Star
• We’ll do that by investing in and leveraging our competitive advantages, delivering industry-leading products
and services, and making sure this is a great place to work for the best talent in this industry
• That’s not to say that we won’t challenge ourselves constantly to make sure that both the strategy and the way
we’re executing on it remains relevant
• It’s critical that we reassess all the time and we will continue to be a leader in evolving and innovating,
particularly, given the potential for change around us
• Among other things, we’ll continue to refine our data and analytics to make sure that we lead in risk selection and
pricing

Innovation
• We’ll continue to innovate on the product side and in our claim and risk control organizations to make sure that
we’re delivering at the forefront for our agents, brokers, and customers
• And we’ll continue to build on our leading position with our distribution partners to make sure that we’re a
partner of choice for them
• We’ve always understood the value of size and scale, and we’re well-positioned in that regard

Growth Opportunities
• Just as in the past, we’ll seek opportunities to grow thoughtfully and in ways that contribute to shareholder value
• And as always, we’ll manage our expenses thoughtfully
• All of that is business as usual for us

• Our confidence in our strategy and our track record in executing on it give us confidence in our ability to
continue to deliver for our shareholders

Jay S. Benet
Financial Highlights
Net Income, ROE and Combined Ratio
• As Alan mentioned, we’re very pleased with our results this quarter
• Net income per diluted share of $2.83, operating income per diluted share of $2.90, and an operating ROE of
15.8%
• These results were driven by the continuation of our very strong current accident year underwriting performance,
as evidenced by an underlying combined ratio of 90.7% despite relatively high non-cat weather-related losses in
the quarter
• Net favorable prior-year reserve development was very strong at $292mm pre-tax and cat losses were relatively
modest at $46mm pre-tax

Interest Rates, Private Equity Returns and Margins
• That said, as shown on page four of the webcast, current quarter results were lower than our very strong fourth
quarter 2014 results, mostly due to the impact of low interest rates and private equity returns on net investment
income and an even higher amount of net favorable prior-year reserve development in the prior-year quarter
• Underlying underwriting margins were pretty much the same in both quarters

Fixed Income NII
• Fixed income NII of $422mm after-tax was down $31mm from the prior-year quarter, principally due to what
we’ve been saying for many years
• Securities that had higher book yields have run off during the past 12 months and have been replaced with
securities having lower yields due to the current low-interest rate environment
• Another contributing factor to lower fixed income NII was the modest reduction in average investments that
resulted in part from the company’s $579mm first quarter 2015 payment to settle the Asbestos Direct Action
Litigation

Reinvestment Yields
• Looking forward, based on the current interest rate environment, we would expect the impact of lower
reinvestment yields and a lower level of fixed maturity investments could in 2016 result in approximately $20mm
to $25mm of lower after-tax NII on a quarterly basis when compared to the corresponding periods of 2015
• Non-fixed income NII of $25mm after-tax was down $42mm from the prior-year quarter, primarily due to lower
private equity returns

• Private equities essentially broke even this quarter as compared to earning $30mm after-tax in the prior-year
quarter due to lower valuations for energy-related investments
• Each of our business segments continued to benefit from net favorable prior-year reserve development in
Business and International Insurance, net favorable development of $176mm pre-tax, primarily resulted from
better-than-expected loss experience in workers’ comp for accident years 2006 and prior and accident year 2014,
in general liability for both primary and excess coverages for accident years 2012 and prior and in the company’s
operations in Canada

Bond & Specialty Insurance
• In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net favorable development of $80mm pre-tax primarily resulted from
better-than-expected loss experience in fidelity and surety for accident years 2012 through 2014, and in Personal
Insurance, net favorable development of $36mm pre-tax primarily resulted from better-than-expected loss
experience in auto liability for accident years 2013 and 2014 and in Homeowners & Other liability for accident
year 2014

Product Line
• As I’ve done in the past, I’d also like to provide you with some insight into what our combined 2015 scheduled
peak is expected to show when it’s filed on May 1
• On a combined stat basis for all of our U.S. subs, all accident years, in the aggregate, across all product lines are
expected to develop favorably, and all but one product line on scheduled peak are expected to develop either
favorably or show very modest or de minimus unfavorable development
• The product line that is expected to develop unfavorably by approximately $50mm pre-tax is products liability
occurrence
• But another product line, other liability occurrence will have an offsetting amount of favorable development,
as we’ve refined our allocation of IBNR between these two components of general liability based upon how
losses, such as those related to construction defect, have been developing by coverage type
• In total, our general liability reserves were not affected by this action

Net Favorable Development
• Returning to GAAP for the year, we had net favorable development of $941mm pre-tax, with $840mm coming
from our U.S. ops and a little over $100mm coming from our Canadian and UK operations

Corporate Cat Aggregate XOL Treaty
• There are two additional topics I’d like to update you on, as shown on page 21 of the webcast, we renewed our
corporate cat aggregate XOL treaty, effective January 1
• The treaty provides coverage for both single cat events and an accumulation of losses from multiple cat events
with similar terms as in the prior year, but at a lower cost
• The treaty continues to provide $1.5B of coverage, part of $2B, excess of $3B, after $100mm deductible per
occurrence
• It keeps the same broad peril and geographic coverage in the same positioning of the coverage layer, providing
a significant buffer between earnings and capital

• The treaty has a single limit with no reinstatement provisions
• And please note that the total cost of this treaty, and therefore, the reduction in cost are quite small in relation
to our operating income

Oil Pricing
• The second topic relates to the recent drop in oil prices
• Page 22 of the webcast contains updated information, showing the magnitude of our investments in below
investment-grade energy bonds and energy-related equities
• And as you can see, the sum of these investments is relatively small and the exposure is quite manageable

Operating Cash Flows
• Operating cash flows remain strong, $760mm in Q4, after making $100mm discretionary contribution to our
qualified pension plan, bringing total operating cash flows to over $3.4B for the year
• We continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our businesses, and consistent with our
ongoing capital management strategy, as you heard from Alan, we returned almost $1.2B of excess capital to our
shareholders this quarter through dividends of $183mm and common share repurchases of a little over $1B

Dividends and Share Repurchase
• For the full-year, we returned almost $4B of excess capital to our shareholders through dividends of $744mm and
common share repurchases of over $3.2B
• Holding company liquidity ended the year at $1.6B, well above our target level and our debt-to-total-capital ratio,
which was 23% at the beginning of the quarter, slightly elevated due to having issued $400mm of debt in Q3 to
pre-fund $400mm of debt that was maturing in Q4 has come back down to 22.1%, well within its target range,
with the retirement of that debt

Net Unrealized Investment Gains and Book Value per Share
• Net unrealized investment gains were almost $2B pre-tax or $1.3B after-tax, which was down from $3B and $2B,
respectively, at the beginning of the year due to an increase in interest rates and spreads
• Book value per share of $79.75 grew 3% from the beginning of the year, and importantly, adjusted book value
per share of $75.39
• Which eliminates the after-tax impact of net unrealized investment gains grew by 6% this year

Brian William MacLean
Operating Highlights
Business and International Insurance Results
• Business and International Insurance results for both Q4 and the full-year were strong

• We continue to generate excellent returns with a full-year combined ratio of 92.1% and our retention throughout
the year was very strong and reached a record level this quarter in our domestic business
• Pricing trends remained relatively consistent with renewal rate change still slightly positive at the end of the year,
while new business volume in our domestic business saw a modest increase

Operating Income and Combined Ratio
• Turning to the quarter’s financial results, operating income was $566mm, with a very strong combined ratio of
89.6%.The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cats and prior-year reserve development was
94.4%, up 0.5 point compared to Q4 2014, primarily due to a higher level of non-cat weather-related losses

Net Written Premiums
Domestic Business Insurance
• Looking at the top line, net written premiums for the quarter were down about 1.5 points compared to Q4
2014, with Domestic Business Insurance premiums up about 1 point
• In Domestic Business Insurance, we remain pleased with the continued execution of our pricing strategy
• As we’ve been saying for some time, given the attractive returns that we are generating in this business, our
focus continues to be on retention, and accordingly, we are very pleased that retention improved to a record
85% in the quarter
• Renewal premium change came in at 2.4 points, while renewal rate change remained positive, but down
slightly vs Q3
• New business of $476mm was up compared to both the prior-year and Q3
• Looking at each of our individual domestic businesses, beginning with select, rate and renewal premium
change were in line with recent quarters, while retention remains strong at 82%, demonstrating continued
stability in this segment of the market

Middle Market
• In the Middle Market, we achieved record retention of 88%
• Overall rate change was about flat and reflected a decline of about 1 point from Q3
• As we’ve always said, the execution below the headline numbers is what matters and we continue to feel great
about the granular results
• Retention for our best-performing business was just over 90% with an average rate decline of less than 2% on
those accounts
• While for our poorer-performing business, we continued to get rate in excess of loss trend

Exposure
• In terms of exposure, the quarter’s results include the drag of about 1 point from our oil and gas business,
resulting from reduced economic activity due to lower energy prices

• Just as a reference point, our oil and gas business makes up only about 3% of Domestic Business Insurance
written premium
• Middle Market new business of $254mm was up from Q3 and in line with the prior-year

Other Business Insurance
• In Other Business Insurance, retention was strong at 80%
• Renewal rate change was about flat even after being negatively impacted by our National Property business
• As I mentioned last quarter, although National Property is seeing the largest rate declines of any business in
our portfolio, we are pleased with the overall performance of this business
• Returns and retention remain strong and pricing trends are stable
• Excluding National Property, renewal rate change for Other Business Insurance remains positive, and was
relatively stable with Q3

International
• Turning to International, net written premiums were down about 16% for the quarter and 14% for the full-year,
primarily due to the adverse impact of foreign exchange rates
• Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net written premiums for Q4 were down about 6%, largely driven by
declines in retention in Canada and, to a lesser extent, at Lloyd’s
• International retention was down in the quarter to 79%, however, renewal premium change was slightly positive
and new business for the quarter was very strong at $80mm, up 18% y-over-y

Canada and Lloyd’s
• In Canada, a competitive renewal environment adversely impacted retention across our book
• However, in June, we launched OPTIMA, our new strategic insurance platform in Canada for Personal
Insurance
• OPTIMA was modeled after our U.S.-based Quantum Auto 2.0 product
• We’re in the early days of the roll-out, but are pleased with the initial response, as we are seeing a significant
increase in new business volume
• In Lloyd’s, we continue to see a challenging market resulting from global economic conditions particularly in
our marine business
• Offsetting this pressure are two new business products that we recently launched, focused on renewable
energy and global construction and early returns are encouraging
• So all-in, for the segment, it was a terrific 2015 with strong financial results in what we see as a remarkably
stable environment, one where our competitive advantages really matter to our customers and agents

Closing Remarks
Before I turn it over to Doreen, I want to make one comment on our outlook for operating margins, which we include in
our quarterly filings

Since our 10-K won’t be filed for a few weeks, I would note that we expect our 2016 underlying underwriting margin
for the segment will be broadly consistent with 2015

Doreen Spadorcia
Highlights
Bond & Specialty Insurance
• Bond & Specialty Insurance finished 2015 with another quarter of exceptional financial results
• Operating income for the quarter was $162mm, down from Q4 2014 due to lower net favorable prior-year reserve
developments, but overall, still a great result

Combined Ratio
• The underlying combined ratio of 80.7% was 3.4 points better than the prior-year quarter due primarily to two
factors:
• A modest increase in the loss ratio in the prior-year quarter that resulted from a re-estimation of the first
three quarters of 2014
• And secondly, the impact of certain customer-related intangible assets, which became fully amortized
during Q2 2015
• Underlying underwriting results continue to run well within our long-term target ranges
• And as Alan mentioned, the full-year underlying combined ratio of 80.1% was an all-time best
• We, obviously, don’t think these results come by accident, we pride ourselves on maintaining the underwriting
discipline, aggressive management of risk and limits, strong account and agency relationships, analytics and
claims management that drive these results

Underwriting Margin
• As we look ahead to 2016 for this segment, we expect underlying underwriting margin to remain broadly
consistent with 2015
• As for tax line, net written premiums, in the aggregate, were down 4% from Q4 2014, primarily due to a
decline in surety volume, driven by lower bonding needs for our accounts, particularly, as compared to the
strong production in Q4 2014
• Surety production can vary significantly q-over-q based on the number, size, and timing of bonded
construction projects awarded to our customers
• We have a strong portfolio of surety clients and believe we will remain well-positioned to capitalize on
increased bonding needs that might result from an improved economy

Management Liability Businesses
• Across our Management Liability businesses, retention remained strong at 85%, while new business premium
was up 17% from Q4 2014

• Renewal premium change trended down with lower rates being partially offset by an increase in other RPC
• Which includes changes in the size of insured’s exposures, limits written, attachment points and policy
duration
• The lower rate was, as expected, and is consistent with the strong profitability of our portfolio
• So all in all, another great quarter closing a strong year for Bond & Specialty Insurance

Personal Insurance
• I’ll turn now to Personal Insurance, where we closed out the year with another quarter of exceptional
underwriting results
• For the segment, operating income for the quarter was $222mm, and the underlying combined ratio was 86.2%
• Great results, and as we move forward, the segment remains positioned to perform in line with our long-term
return goals

Auto
• I’ll touch on the quarterly results for Agency Auto and Agency Property in a moment, but first I’d like to share
with you some thoughts on how we view the underlying health of these businesses
• First for Auto, I’ll start by saying how pleased we are with the vibrancy of our Auto business
• The market response from both agents and consumers to Quantum Auto 2.0 remains incredibly strong
• And the portfolio is positioned to generate financial returns within our long-term target range

Agency Channel
• In the agency channel, we added 157,000 policies during 2015, an 8% increase from the end of 2014
• As always, there remains competition in Auto, and we remain committed to keeping our products priced
accordingly through disciplined expense management and superior pricing and underwriting segmentation
• As we look ahead to 2016, we expect the Auto business to continue to grow in both policy count and premium
volume, although at a more moderated percentage than 2015 as the portfolio grows

Agency Auto Profitability
• As for Agency Auto profitability, we’ve mentioned on several occasions that we’re comfortable with where
our margins are, given the current market environment
• That still remains the case today
• The full-year underlying agency combined ratio of just under 97% was in line with our expectations for the
year and a result we are pleased with
• This combined ratio is somewhat higher than our long-term goal, driven particularly by the amount of new
business that we’ve added over the past two years
• Quantum Auto 2.0 is priced to our long-term target returns, but, as you all know, the relatively higher
combined ratio of new business improved over time

New Business
• As we look into 2016, the significant volume of new business we’ve added will drive a slightly higher CY
combined ratio compared to 2015
• So far the profitability of Quantum Auto 2.0 is maturing in line with our expectations
• With this return profile, we continue to seek more new business, as it should be accretive to long-term returns

Homeowners
• On Homeowners, the financial returns generated in the last couple of years have been exceptional and well within
our target range
• As you recall, we made significant improvements in the risk profile of this business over the last few years,
including changes in deductibles, other terms and conditions and tightened underwriting guidelines
• Of course, this is a more volatile business that will always have a weather dynamic to it
• The weather in the last couple of years has been somewhat lower than our models suggested, but we know that
won’t always be the case

2015 Results
• As we look ahead to 2015 (sic) [2016] with respect to profitability, we do expect underlying underwriting
margins in Agency Homeowners & Other to be lower than 2015, reflecting more normalized levels of loss
activity
• As Alan mentioned, we’re also very pleased with the improvements we’ve seen in homeowners’ productions
• This is attributable, in part, to account rounding, along with making some localized pricing and process
adjustments, and certainly, the turnaround benefited from the momentum and agent engagements from the
roll-out of Quantum Auto 2.0
• At this point, the business has leveled off from a policies in force perspective, and we expect modest growth in
2016

Agency Auto
New Business Premium and Combined Ratio
• Now I’ll just highlight a couple of things specific to the quarter
• Looking at Agency Auto, new business premium was up 32% and net premium was up 12% from fourth
quarter 2014 levels, and we’ve added 51,000 policies during the quarter
• The combined ratio for the quarter was 98.1% and included over 2 points of favorable prior-year reserve
development
• The underlying combined ratio was 100.2%, up from the prior-year due predominantly to adverse weather in
this year’s quarter and the benefit in the prior-year quarter of a 2.5 points favorable re-estimation of losses
related to the first three quarters of 2014

• As for loss trend in Auto, our view of normalized frequency and severity remains consistent with recent
quarters at around 3% in aggregate
• There continues to be a lot of discussion about trends, particularly, increasing frequency
• From our vantage point, while we may observe normal fluctuations in any particular period due to things like
weather, we see a stable and unchanged long-term frequency trend
• As always, we continue to monitor external information and our own data closely using our extensive analytic
capabilities

Agency Homeowners & Other
Combined Ratio and New Business Premiums
• Turning to Agency Homeowners & Other for the quarter, we once again had strong financial results despite
relatively active weather in the month of December
• The underlying combined ratio of 69.5% was slightly higher than the exceptionally favorable prior-year
quarter
• As for production, new business premiums were up 27% from the prior-year quarter and continue to trend
favorably, while retention remains strong at 85%
• Policies in force were up slightly both sequentially from last quarter and from Q4 2014
• So to sum up Personal Insurance, we’re exceptionally proud of the year we’ve had and look forward to more
of the same in 2016

QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION
<Q - Jay Gelb>: The first question I had was on the potential for share buyback. Alan, any change in view in terms of
deploying well in excess of annual earnings in share buybacks? And the buybacks has gone down just slightly annually
over the past [indiscernible] (31:04) I’m thinking we might see that trend in place for 2016/2017 as well.
<A - Alan D. Schnitzer>: Jay, good morning. Thanks for the question. No change in strategy or approach to share
buybacks or capital management overall. And there’s no intent, and there’s never been an effort to deploy more than
earnings, right? We’ve had excess capital in past years. And we made that very clear that we were sort of adding that to
our annual income to buy back stock. But we said – I don’t know – a year or two ago that our level of buybacks would
be tied to our level of income.
And so we’ll have a level of earnings. We’ll do what we need to do with it, whether that’s making pension
contributions or investments in the business and we’ll take what’s left and return that to shareholders. And there won’t
be a perfect correlation between earnings in a year and share buybacks in a year. There are some timing differences, but
I think, as we said pretty consistently recently, share buybacks going forward will be tied to earnings.
<Q - Jay Gelb>: Okay. And then, on the investment income from the non-fixed income investments, it was clearly
impacted by lower energy prices in Q4, and given the collapse in energy prices so far this year, I’m just trying to get a
baseline of what you might expect for 2016. Is that $25mm result probably going to head lower on a quarterly basis
from what we saw in Q4?
<A - Jay S. Benet>: Let me just clarify one thing about the $25mm. That relates to the fixed income portfolio, not the
non-fixed income portfolio.
<A - William Herbert Heyman>: Hi, Jay. It’s Bill Heyman. Obviously, this week is a hard week from which to
extrapolate for the rest of the year. The marks as of year-end reflected a price, which was an oil price higher than the

price which obtained today, but not by as much as one might think. During the year, most funds wrote down their
holdings. And in some cases after the write-downs, the price of petroleum rose, but nothing was written up again. So
we think a lot of these portfolios have been marked pretty hard. That said, if we had to predict either way, there’s
probably a little downside left in the portfolio, but the portfolio isn’t that big that the amount ought to be material than
the aggregate.
<Q - Jay Gelb>: Okay. That’s helpful for a starting point. And, Jay, just to clarify, so talking about the $25mm of
income in Q4 from the non-fixed income investment portfolio in terms of the [indiscernible] (33:57) of fixed income. I
understand what you were saying in terms of lower yields [indiscernible] (34:03).
<A - Jay S. Benet>: Yeah. I apologize for the confusion there.
<Q - Jay Gelb>: That’s okay. No problem. So, but, Bill, you’re saying that $25mm after-tax we saw in Q4 shouldn’t
be that impacted by lower energy prices even so…
<A - William Herbert Heyman>: No. I couldn’t put a number on it, especially, after the first part of this month, but
I’m simply saying that everyone assumes that there’s a lot of downside based on prices as they are today. And there
might be less downside than it appears simply because of the way in which funds mark their holdings in 2015.
<Q - Randy Binner>: I think you touched on this in the opening commentary, but from my perspective, the headline
pricing number you provided in the slide deck of plus 0.6% was better than expected. And, I guess, I’m interested in
your perspective on if you think Travelers is unique here. A lot of the headline surveys that we look at in the industry
for commercial lines are moving significantly negative across the board. So I just wanted to get your perspective on if
you think Travelers is unique here and how much kind of discipline, I guess, you think your competitors are holding
against the softer market.
<A - Alan D. Schnitzer>: Yeah, Randy, good morning. It’s Alan. You said it was a surprise. It wasn’t necessarily a
surprise to us. It may have been a surprise to you or others. But relative to the surveys, what we can tell you is we’re
showing you real data. And I think what we’ve always seen is surveys tend to be anecdotally based and tend to maybe
overemphasize some volatility either up or down, because maybe the people responding to the surveys are thinking
about the last transaction or the transactions in their minds.
So there’s really nothing about this that surprises us. And we’ve been saying for a while that we expect the amplitude
of the market to moderate. This appears to have moderated. And I think the fact that we can achieve what we did is, I
think, a function of two things. One, our data and analytics, our expertise, our ability to execute at a very, very granular
level, and a marketplace that is, we would describe as, remarkably stable, and at the moment, rational.
<Q - Randy Binner>: Just a quick follow-up. Are there any lines that are really helping that figure? Meaning, is
workers’ comp still kind of the best from a pricing perspective where some other casualty lines might be moving
negative?
<A - Brian William MacLean>: No, this is Brian. It’s still a pretty tight band, to be honest with you, across all the
lines. So nothing is dramatically out of pattern, up or down. As we commented, and Alan touched on in his comments,
and I on mine, it’s more larger accounts feeling more pressure than medium and smaller accounts. As we said, National
Property is the space where we’re seeing more significant rate declines than others. So I think it’s more an account size
than a line of business volatility or variability.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: I guess, Doreen, maybe a little bit more on the Auto side. Have you seen any impact from
the rise in miles driven in your Auto book, just given the fact that your growth has sort of come alongside that rise in
miles driven?
<A - Doreen Spadorcia>: So let me just talk a little bit about miles driven. The data shows that probably YTD the
miles driven are up about 2.5% per capita. And there’s still a lot of debate about whether that makes a difference if it’s
a long trip, a short trip, whether there’s unemployment, whether you have safety features in your vehicles. And so we
watch that closely, but our long-term trend of 3% anticipates that. And we really haven’t seen anything that that
particular item is causing us to view frequency differently today.

<A - Brian William MacLean>: And just to be crystal clear, the 3% is total trends…
<A - Doreen Spadorcia>: Yes. Total trends…
<A - Brian William MacLean>: With frequency being a small fraction of that.
<A - Doreen Spadorcia>: Right.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Got it. Thanks. And then, I guess, in Middle Market, I mean, with retention up in the high
80%s, I mean, is that something that you could see that maybe coming down? Or would you be comfortable with that at
a lower level, if you saw an opportunity to find some more rate increase opportunity? It just seems that high 80%s, if
pricing is flat and the results are pretty good, I mean, is that an area where you could look to push for more rate at some
point?
<A - Brian William MacLean>: This is Brian again. That is a constant balancing act in our organization every day. I
will tell you that overall our core Middle Market business from a return perspective is in a very healthy spot. And as I
said in the comments, when we look at our better-performing business, which is not a tiny part of the portfolio, our very
well-performing business, we’re at retentions north of 90%. With pretty modest price increases, we’d obviously love to
renew it the 90%s with different price increases, but retaining that business is a real priority, because it is returning
very, very well.
With that said, we’re always looking for opportunities to see where we can balance the rate and retention trade-off.
<A - Alan D. Schnitzer>: I would add to that. Even though that’s not the headline number, that continues to be a
headline number. And the execution below that number is very, very granular. So we’re not managing that headline
number. We’re managing every single account.
<Q - Michael Nannizzi>: Great. And just real quick, I don’t know, Bill – do you guys disclose – definitely I appreciate
your disclosure on the energy portfolio, do you guys disclose anywhere a BBB minus category of energy exposure as
well? Just that sort of next rating level up?
<A - William Herbert Heyman>: Well, I can tell you that the investment grade portfolio has an average rating of
single A. And the high-yield portfolio, which is 23 credits with book value of $162mm, has an average rating of BB
minus, which given the size ought to give you what you need.
<Q - Josh Clayton Stirling>: I was just thinking maybe you live in interesting times. You’ve had good fortune here to
become CEO at the time the industry structure is changing very rapidly. I mean, obviously, over the past six months,
we’ve seen ACE and Chubb merge creates a very large and powerful competitor, and on the other hand, over at AIG,
there’s presumably going to be lots of opportunities for everyone in the industry.
Have thought from Travelers’ perspective, how the environment is evolving? How are you guys going to sort of tackle
these new challenges and opportunities? And what should we do to see Travelers take advantage of all this change in
the market?
<A - Alan D. Schnitzer>: Yeah. Good morning, Josh. So, I guess, what I would share with you is that we are very
aware and deeply engaged in all of those things. So whether that’s what’s going on with any of our competitors, or
what’s going on with technology, or big data, or driverless cars, consolidation among distribution, you could go on and
on. I think what I would share with you is we’re very aware and deeply engaged. As we see all of those things and
others, those, by the way, weren’t meant to be necessarily in order what’s top of my mind, just what came to my mind.
But, as we think of everything that’s got the potential to change in this marketplace, nothing’s going to change
overnight. These are things that are all going to evolve and develop over time.
And what we’ve got great confidence in is our positioning to manage all of them. So we think we can understand and
manage. We’ve got the talent, we’ve got the resources, we’ve got a deep understanding of risk and reward. And the
quality of our underlying business, the results you see this quarter and this year, we’ve got no distractions. So we are
starting from a really good point as we think about and engage on all of those issues. And without taking one by one,

for the most part and maybe all in, we see more opportunity than we do risk, but we’re certainly examining them from
both sides, making sure that where there is opportunity, we’re positioning ourselves to be able to leverage it, and where
there’s risk that we’re making sure we do everything we need to do to mitigate it.
<Q - Josh Clayton Stirling>: That’s helpful. I wonder if we can maybe just switch gears a little bit. You mentioned
risk. Could you give us a little bit of – maybe either Alan or Brian, or whoever’s appropriate, a little bit of help of
understanding what the liability side exposures, maybe not Travelers per se, but just generally, for the industry, from a
meltdown in the commodities and energy patch would be?
I mean, presumably, we might see a bunch of bankruptcies. We use a lot of different product lines that you sell and that
everybody in the industry sells into companies. And I remember a decade or so ago Chubb really surprised people
when they had got hurt in the energy surety deal with Enron. And obviously, you’ve got D&O and E&O exposures and
maybe work comp severity. So I’m sure you guys are playing defense here. I’m wondering if you can help us sort of
think through how you and your underwriters are thinking about potential exposures if that part of the world keeps
getting hurt?
<A - Alan D. Schnitzer>: I’ll start and then I’ll look to either Brian or Doreen and invite them to jump in. I’ll say you
sort of hit it, we think about the loss side of that equation all the time, and whether it’s going to our Management
Liability book or our surety book, making sure that we understand what our exposures are, and I’ll say that we look at
these things – we don’t wait for there to be something significant in the marketplace to look at it.
We’re looking at it all the time and as far out as we can. So we’re managing our nets. We’re looking at on the surety
side what kind of collateral we have, for instance, on some of these accounts. We exit accounts when we need to exit
accounts. But we’ve got a really good track record, I think, in all those businesses. Just on the Management Liability
side, for example, we’re much more heavily weighted on the – be on the private non-profit side as opposed to the large
public D&O. And so it’s – this is what we do every day is manage risk and think about risk and reward. But, Doreen?
Brian?
<A - Doreen Spadorcia>: Thank you, Alan. The only thing I’d add to that is that when we see any potential issue, we
run that through our entire book of business, not just what that class of business is. So we look at all the consequential
effects that that may have on related industries. And so, for example, in writing banks, we look at the level of their
portfolios that are exposed, not just to oil and gas, but to any one thing in particular. So, obviously, surety, watching
credit, and looking at collateral, other Management Liability areas, looking at concentrations, but this isn’t unique to us.
We always take an issue and run it through the entire book and look at any consequences that might come from that.
<Q - Ryan J. Tunis>: I think my first question is for Brian. And I think he mentioned it in his prepared remarks that, in
Middle Market, I think, the better accounts you were renewing, I think, with a modest rate decline. A decline, but it
sounded like it was only modest. I guess, I’m just curious, how is the conversation changing with those better accounts
now vs. maybe a year ago? Right now, like I said, it sounds like it’s maybe a modest decline. I mean, is that kind of
what everyone’s kind of looking for still just modest? Or just how is that conversation evolving?
<A - Brian William MacLean>: Yeah. It’s pretty much as you’re saying and as you would expect based on the data. A
couple of years ago, almost every conversation was starting with some form of price increase even for the best
accounts, because everybody saw where the trends were. And that is gradually mitigated over time, but even with those
better accounts, the conversation starts somewhere with trying to renew it at a modest decline or flat. Obviously, if the
average is less than 2%, there are still some that are positive.
The thing that we’re doing probably a little different than we were a year or two ago is we’re really trying to get out as
early as possible. Frequently, at least, three months, if not, six months ahead of time, have conversations with the
broker and the account. I think we do have a strong franchise with a valued product and valued services, and
fortunately, most of those companies start by wanting to stay with us.
And then, I think the other key point is really being able to have the data and analytics, where our front line people can
see and really segment their portfolio, and in the Middle Market account by account, look at how they’re performing.
And when there are issues either in that account, in that line, or in that class of business, being able to have an informed

conversation with the broker about what those are, and why we’re trying to do what we’re doing on the account really,
really makes a difference. So I’d say the big changes is getting out early and having a kind of granular conversation on
the performance of that line and that business.
<Q - Ryan J. Tunis>: Got it. Okay. And then, my follow-up was actually a follow-up to Jay’s question on capital
return and excessive operating income. I guess, since the start of 2014, we see like your premiums surplus ratios drifted
up from about 1 to 1.2. Leverage has been relatively flat. You said over the past couple of years, you’ve had excess,
you’ve been able to deploy. I mean, how do we think about that level of excess? Just because, on those metrics, it does
seem like whatever excess you did have, you have sort of used to a certain extent. I mean, are those metrics even
relevant?
<A - Jay S. Benet>: This is Jay Benet. The premium-to-surplus ratio, I would view, as not being relevant at all. I mean,
that was a ratio that was used at a time when rating agencies and regulators didn’t have the sophisticated models they
have today. So as I’ve said on previous calls, we deal with each one of the models, whether it’s our internal models, the
regulatory models, or the rating agency models to come to a place where given the profile of our business as it relates
to each quarter, what is the capital that we think we need in the operating entities that we manage to support a AA
rating, and support a solid AA rating, not one where if the wind blows, we’re worried about our ratings going down.
So that’s always the starting point. And given the size of our book, it doesn’t change very much from
quarter-to-quarter. But what does change is the profitability in each quarter. So there are some quarters, where the
profitability, whether it’s for favorable development or some other things that take place is higher than our
expectations, keeping in mind that we have a flow of moneys out of the operating companies up to the holding
company each quarter based on expectation. So to the extent we earn more, we bring some more up probably a little
later than that.
I think if you go back over time and you go past two years ago to an earlier period and start adding up the earnings vs.
the share repurchases, you see that there’s a very, very strong correlation to that. So I wouldn’t read into anything that
says one year we’ve done a little more than earnings, another year we did less. It’s really just, as Alan said earlier, the
timing. And now if the premium-to-surplus ratio goes up a little bit, I’d kind of ignore that. What I’d look at is in our
supplement, we talk about specifically on a quarterly basis what the stat surplus is. And I think you can see that moves
around probably in a pretty narrow band.
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: Just a question on loss cost trend. With pricing roughly flat, curious how we’re managing to
leave margins flat in 2016 vs. 2015?
<A - Brian William MacLean>: Yeah. So this is Brian. And speaking for the BII segment, you start with the kind of
simple arithmetic of the earned premium. And again, it’s not just rate. It’s price, which includes exposure change and
does offset some trends. So when we look at the arithmetic of earned rate vs. loss trend, we come up with a very
modest about 0.5 point of loss ratio compression into 2016.
And that, of course, is based on our assumption of loss trend, which is, as we said, running right now at about 4%, and
looking at a relatively stable, orderly marketplace. And then, that’s offset by a variety of other factors. You can think of
weather, large losses, mix change, underwriting actions, et cetera. But the real starting point is, is that compression
from the rate loss trend dynamic – price loss trend dynamic is a pretty modest number in how we’re looking at it.
<A - Alan D. Schnitzer>: And I think that distinction between price and rate is important, because as we said in the
past, there’s a meaningful component of exposure that from a profitability perspective behaves like rate. And so what
we really see in that true margin deterioration is we see going forward, as Brain said, it’s very small and probably
within the margin of error of all the other things that impact margin.
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: So fair enough. The second question is on the pace of future rate increases. You mentioned
that on a best-performing accounts, you have rate decreases of less than 2%. So curious what proportion of the accounts
now are well-performing and so should we see sort of further pressure on pricing this year, because more of the
accounts are better performing?

<A - Brian William MacLean>: Yeah. I think there’s a level of granularity and precision here that, for competitive
reasons, I’m not going to overly segment the portfolio. I think the backdrop to this is, is really the view of do we think
the industry is going to continue to fundamentally be focused on returns in the product. And we think that’s the right
way to be thinking about the business. And we’re optimistic that the majority of the marketplace is actually looking at
that. So the healthier the business, the more pressure there should be on pricing, but in the aggregate, we’re pretty
comfortable that we should be able to generate appropriate with pricing to maintain reasonable returns. And then, you
can come up with any variation on the theme you want off of that and be as bullish or bearish as you want.
<Q - Charles J. Sebaski>: I have a couple of questions, I guess, on the personal lines business. I guess, the first on the
personal Auto growth success you’ve had from Quantum. Is that coming from standalone Auto policies? I guess, I’m
trying to just understand that your kind of sweet spot seems to be on package multi-policy programs. You have Auto
growth while Homeowners is flat, just kind of wondering how you’re working in the Auto growth relative to your kind
of package program.
<A - Doreen Spadorcia>: Good morning. This is Doreen. We’ve actually seen success in both, and I think this was
some of what Alan and I referred to in our earlier comments. Clearly, our Auto product was competitive in agents
office and also in the direct channel. And in many cases, what that did, because we’re an account-focused company,
that allowed us then to bring the home with it. So we’ve seen standalone Auto come in. We’ve seen more opportunities
for cross-selling. And I don’t think it’s anything small, given Quantum Auto 2.0 that we’ve been able to actually
increase and stop the shrinkage in Homeowners.
We’ve also put some processes in place that have been very helpful, where it pre-fills certain information. So that if
someone is looking at an auto quote, it will prefill for home. So we like the account business. We continue to look for
that, but given where the returns are and where we’re going with Auto, we’re pleased with that as well.
<Q - Charles J. Sebaski>: Okay. I guess, finally, just a follow-up to a comment that you guys made in the business
insurance regarding the exposure drag and the oil and gas exposure. I think, you said that oil and gas accounted for a
1-point exposure drag, but that oil and gas only accounted for 3% of the book? Or is that 3% of the exposure? I guess, I
was trying to understand how 3% could account for a 1-point drag.
<A - Alan D. Schnitzer>: Yeah. The 3% is a premium number, but the exposure, as you can imagine, was down pretty
significantly. So when you combine the 3% against a pretty big exposure delta in oil and gas, that drove the 1%.
<A - Doreen Spadorcia>: And the 3% is total Domestic Business Insurance, not to Middle Market net written
premiums.
<A - Alan D. Schnitzer>: Yeah. And that’s a good point, and maybe we shouldn’t have mixed those two numbers. The
1% drag was on the Middle Market exposure change. The 3% was on total Domestic BI. So if we did that arithmetic
quickly.
<A - Jay Steven Fishman>: 3% is the premium. The 1% is on the chart.
<A - Alan D. Schnitzer>: And exposure?
<A - Jay Steven Fishman>: And the exposure…
<A - Alan D. Schnitzer>: And it’s both Middle Market?
<A - Jay Steven Fishman>: The 1% exposure drag is Middle Market exposure.
<A - Alan D. Schnitzer>: Yeah.
<A - Jay Steven Fishman>: 3% is quantifying the percentage of the premiums of our oil and gas business on the total
business insurance book.
<A - Alan D. Schnitzer>: Right, right. So the premium on just Middle Market would be a higher number.
<A - Jay Steven Fishman>: Correct.

<Q - Charles J. Sebaski>: Okay. That makes sense how you could have one, but I just – the math just didn’t seem to
work. I appreciate the clarity.
<A - Alan D. Schnitzer>: Yeah.
<Q - Kai Pan>: First question is on reserve releases. Looks like workers’ comp you have released is in 2014 accident
year. Just curious why the early release rather than for this normally long tail line basis. And can you talk also in
general what loss cost trend by major lines, and how that compares with your 4% assumption in overall loss cost
trends?
<A - Jay S. Benet>: This is Jay Benet. Just in terms of the reserve release, when you’re dealing with a long tail line,
you have two components to how you’re going look at the reserves. One is what has developed in terms of the loss
activity, and you’re absolutely right. In a short period of time, you’re not going to really see a great deal of activity. On
the other hand, what you’ve done is, you’ve established a starting point for what you think the loss activity is going to
be. And we refer to that as the loss pick.
So just imagine on January 1, trying to predict what the losses are going to be for the entire period of time that those
workers’ comp policies will be out there. And you come up with a loss pick. In the example I’m going to use, I’m just
making up a number, let’s say, it’s 60% based on what you’ve seen historically, all right. And you’re looking at the
historical data then for earlier accident years and evaluating that against that initial loss pick that you had for a current
year. And there are times when you see loss activity in prior years that you say, that really has no bearing, whatsoever,
on how I thought about the starting point for the current year, and then, there are times when you look at it and you say,
no, actually this really does change the bar for the starting point.
So usually, on a long tail line of business, when you see us do what we’ve done here, it’s based on what we refer to as
base year movement, looking at the history and just saying that the initial loss pick was a little on the high side.
<A - Brian William MacLean>: And I was going to say – this is Brian, to respond to your – trend by line in business,
so this is actually a pretty tight band with ranging from the high 3%s to the high 4%s, but an average trend of right
around 4%. So nothing really out of pattern by line.
<Q - Kai Pan>: Okay. Well, thank you so much. My follow-up question is for Alan. Now you’re seven weeks on the
