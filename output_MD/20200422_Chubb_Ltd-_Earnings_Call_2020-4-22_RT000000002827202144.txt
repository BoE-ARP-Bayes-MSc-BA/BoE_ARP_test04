{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Good morning.

Bloomberg Transcript

We're in an unprecedented moment of historic proportions. None of us living today has
experienced an event of this nature of magnitude. It is at once surreal and catastrophic.
As a country, we will manage through and heal both our society and economy and it will
take time.
The decisive heroic actions taken by our health professionals in combination with the
support and leadership of our federal and state governments, and our vast private sector
and civil society are a powerful force to combat the virus, stabilize our financial markets,
support our economy which remains in a virtual coma, and set the stage for recovery.
The most important thing we can do now to achieve stability and health while reopening
the economy is to improve our test, digital trace and isolate capability. The insurance
industry plays an important role in our economic foundation. During this health and
economic crisis, we are shouldering our responsibilities, and carrying our share of the
financial load. This event impacts both the liability and asset side of our industry balance
sheet.
With that, I'm going to divide my remarks into two parts. First our quarterly results, which
were very good. Then I'll provide some perspective on the current environment and how
we are operating. To begin, as you saw from the numbers, we reported core operating
income in the first quarter of $2.68 per share.
The quarter was marked by very strong premium revenue growth globally, an excellent
underwriting results on both a published and current accident year basis. The calendar
year P&C combined ratio for the quarter was 89.1% versus 89.2% prior year with P&C
underwriting income up over 9.5% in constant dollar.

Company N ame: Chubb L td

On a current accident year basis, excluding cats, the combined ratio was 87.5%, a full
point improvement over prior year with current accident year underwriting income up over
18%, the major difference between calendar year and current accident year, underwriting
income growth was a reduced benefit from the runoff of the '19 crop insurance year. You'll
recall '19 was a difficult year for agriculture while '18 was an excellent one. Book and
tangible book value per share declined 5.5% and 7.5% respectively for the quarter, and
Phil will have more to say about investment income book value, cats, and prior period
development.
Turning to growth in the rate environment; P&C net premiums grew 8.9% on a published
or 9.3% in constant dollars. The commercial P&C pricing environment continued to firm
across the globe. We secured greater market share as we achieved improved rate to
exposure in more lines of business and this necessary firming continued into April.
Overall rates increased in North America commercial, which includes both major accounts
and specialty as well as middle market and small commercial by 10.5%. New business was
up 27.5% in the quarter, and renewal retention was 95% on a premium basis.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our North America commercial P&C business had a strong quarter with net premiums
growth of over 10%. In major accounts and specialty commercial, excluding ag premiums
grew about 9.5% with major account retail growth of 7% and E&S wholesale growth of
over 19%. In terms of rate increases, rates for major accounts were up 13%, and in
Westchester and Bermuda, they were up 16% and 42% respectively.
Turning to our U.S. middle market and small commercial division; premiums grew 11%
overall with middle-market up 9% and small commercial up over 40%. Renewal retention
in our middle market business was 94.5%. Middle market pricing was up over 6.5%; and
excluding workers comp, it was up over 7%.
In our North America personal lines business, net premiums written in the quarter were up
4.8% and the retention remained very strong at 98% on a premium basis. In our
international general insurance operations, growth remains strong with net premiums
written up 10% in constant dollar, and FX then had a negative impact of about 1.3 points.
Net premiums for London wholesale business grew over 27% while our retail division was
up over 8.5%. Growth in our international retail business was led by Latin America, which
was up 13, Continental Europe and the UK had growth of 9.7% and 9.1% respectively. And
overall rates in our international retail business were up 8% and 18% in our London
wholesale.
Our international life insurance business had a strong quarter with net written premiums
up nearly 30% in constant dollar. John Keogh, John Lupica, Paul Krump, and Juan Luis
Ortega can provide further color on the quarter including current market conditions and
pricing trends, but that's ancient history and from another time. What's important is to
recognize the underlying strength and momentum of our company as we entered this
moment.

FINAL

Turning to the current environment, the COVID-19 pandemic and consequent economic
crisis will of course impact Chubb. Our growth momentum, particularly in our commercial
P&C business globally continued into April, and we continue to experience improved rate
to exposure.
As we go forward, offsetting that will be a meaningful impact to growth from the health
and economic crisis as exposures in important areas shrink for a time with the impact
varying by country. This includes consumer-related lines; for example, travel insurance,
A&H discretionary purchases, automobile insurance, commercial lines, where exposures
are reduced while businesses are closed or as they reopen and are diminished or simply
go out of business.
Small commercial businesses in aggregate will be more impacted than medium, which will
be more impacted than large companies, but it will vary substantially by industry. The
credit related products such as trade credit surety and other lines such as workers comp,
premium revenue will be impacted by reduced exposures.

Bloomberg Transcript

As you know, we do not give forward guidance; and in this case, the degree of revenue
impact is simply unknowable. On the other hand, as I said, we are and will continue to
benefit in terms of growth from improved technical conditions as many insurance
companies take actions to reduce exposures or improve their rate to exposure to correct
for inadequate underwriting.
This will be an earnings event for Chubb. It will not threaten our balance sheet. Operating
earnings will be impacted predominantly on the liability side of the balance sheet from
increased insurance claims though the asset side will likely be impacted as well from
increased asset impairments. In addition, as I just mentioned, earnings will be impacted by
a reduction in premium revenues for a period of time.
In sum, from what we know now, this will be a manageable cat-like event. However, from
an exposure, we really don't discretely price for, so its impact is additive to our normal
projected loss exposure; in a sense, it's like what terrorism exposure was before 9/11.
We have a very strong balance sheet. Our capital and liquidity position are robust, and
Chubb will continue to operate at a high level and emerge strong or stronger. Again,
insurance has an important role to play in society and in the economy and we are
shouldering our share of responsibility while doing our job to support our employees, our
customers, and our business partners.
We have been quite clear about our priorities and it shows in our response. First, to the
extent possible, we have taken care of our 33,000 people around the world and
endeavored to keep them safe through aggressive work-from-home protocols. We have
provided them a degree of peace of mind knowing their jobs and benefits are secure
during the health crisis with a no layoff pledge.
Second, we have remained consistent in how we take care of our customers and
distribution partners doing what we can to support their needs. In fact, we are operating
Page 4 of 23



Company N ame: Chubb L td
Company Ticker: CB US Equity
Date: 2020-04-22

around the globe as a normal company during abnormal times.

FINAL

I am so proud and absolutely grateful for how my colleagues are performing every day as
a group from the smallest to the largest unit, from the biggest to the smallest country,
how each is focused on delivering on our mission from internal operations to underwriting
sales, claims, marketing, and finance. It's really quite remarkable.
We're extending payment terms to commercial customers recognizing their cash flow
pressures. We're providing a premium credit for auto policy holders in the U.S. recognizing
their reduced exposures. We're supporting our U.S. small business clients with premium
reductions for their reduced exposures, and we're supporting our small commercial
clients by providing healthcare workers, and first responders with gift cards redeemable
at our customers' businesses.
Lastly, as a corporate citizen, we're contributing to the immediate emergency response
today while supporting the future tomorrow. Our commitment of $10 million to pandemic
relief efforts globally is being directed to a range of organizations that provide essential
resources immediately in areas that are facing the most acute need.

Bloomberg Transcript

This includes providing emergency medical equipment and supplies to healthcare facilities
and helping community food banks to support those, who are hungry and vulnerable,
including so many who've become unemployed as a result of the pandemic. This is only
the first chapter. As we move into the recovery phase, The Chubb Foundation will commit
substantial additional funds.
In sum, our country -- our company is very strong. Our balance sheet is in good shape,
and we are operating well. While I see pressure on revenue and earnings in the short
term, I see much opportunity for us in the future. Given all of our capabilities, I am
confident Chubb will weather these difficult times, and emerge stronger from this
challenge.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Phil, and then we'll be back to take your questions.

Philip V. Bancrof t

{BIO 4621336 <GO>}

Thank you, Evan. I want to begin with a few words on our financial position, which remains
exceptionally strong. Our balance sheet includes a AA-rated investment portfolio with a
relatively short duration and a conservative approach to our loss reserves. We have over
$67 billion in total capital, which as we enter this period is very strong stemming from
superior operating performance.
Our access to liquidity on a global basis is excellent and unimpaired. Our operating cash
flow remains quite strong, and was $1.7 billion for the quarter. Net realized and unrealized
losses for the quarter of $3.7 billion after tax included $2.2 billion from an investment
portfolio, which resulted primarily from widening credit spreads in the investment grade
and high yield bond portfolio through March 31st.

Page 5 of 23



Company N ame: Chubb L td
Company Ticker: CB US Equity
Date: 2020-04-22

FINAL

Even after considering the valuation adjustments noted, our portfolio remained in an
overall unrealized gain position through the quarter end. Since that time, credit markets
have recovered and liquidity has improved as a result of the extraordinary actions taken
by the Fed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The portfolio mark has improved by approximately 1.7 billion pre-tax through this Monday.
We also had a mark-to-market loss on our variable annuity reinsurance portfolio of $560
million. This was primarily due to negative equity returns and an increase in implied
volatility.
Again, this is purely a mark-to-market adjustment required because the transactions are
deemed to be derivatives for accounting purposes and it does not indicate a reduction in
cash flows from our reinsurance treaties for the quarter. The results are in line with our
expectations given these market conditions.

Bloomberg Transcript

Finally, realized and unrealized losses included $896 million after tax losses from FX
related to our net asset exposure to foreign currency. These represent a point in time
mark-to-market valuation adjustment, and do not affect the capital position of our
international operating units. As we noted in the press release, the marks are market
price-driven based on the last day of the quarter and a moment in time. We believe they
are largely transient and will accrete back to book value over time.
Adjusted net investment income for the quarter was $893 million pre-tax, and was within
our guidance range. During March, we engaged on the margin in several tactical
adjustments to the portfolio. We purchased a modest amount of high-quality equities, and
modestly increased our exposure to investment-grade corporate bonds.
While there are a number of factors that impact the variability in investment income, we
expect our quarterly run rate to remain in the range of $885 million to $895 million. Net
catastrophe losses for the quarter were $237 million pre-tax or $199 million after tax
including $224 million from global weather-related events, and $13 million so far from
COVID-19, which has been classified as an ongoing catastrophe.
While there was no significant impact on core operating income in the first quarter relating
to COVID-19, the company anticipates that this global catastrophe event will have an
impact on revenue as well as net and core operating income in the second quarter, and
potentially future quarters as a result of an increase in insurance claims due to both the
pandemic and recessionary economic conditions.
On a constant dollar basis, net loss reserves increased $363 million in the quarter and
include the impact of catastrophe loss payments, favorable prior period development,
and crop insurance payments in the quarter. On a reported basis, the paid-to-incurred
ratio was 95%. After adjusting for the items noted above, the paid-to-incurred ratio was
88%.
We had favorable prior period development in the quarter of $118 million pre-tax or $94
million after tax. The favorable development is split approximately 28% in long tail lines
Page 6 of 23



Company N ame: Chubb L td
Company Ticker: CB US Equity
Date: 2020-04-22

principally from accident years 2016 and prior and 72% in short tail lines.

FINAL

Last year's favorable development of $204 million included $61 million of positive
development from our agriculture segment resulting from stronger than expected results
from the 2018 crop year. As we said at year-end based on a difficult 2019 crop year, this
level of development would not recur in the first quarter of 2020.
Among the capital related actions in the quarter, we returned $666 million to
shareholders, including $340 million in dividends, and $326 million in share repurchases at
an average price of $142.67 per share. Given the current economic environment and to
reserve capital for both risk and opportunity, the company has suspended further share
repurchases indefinitely.
Our annualized core operating ROE in the quarter was 9.4%, and our core operating
return on tangible equity was 15.1%. Our core operating effective tax rate for the quarter
was 16.3%. We continue to expect our annual core operating effective tax rate to be in the
range of 14% to 16%.
I'll turn the call back to Helen -- I mean, to Karen, sorry, excuse me, to Karen.

Thank you. At this point, we're happy to take your questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Question And Answer)
(Operator Instructions) And with that we will take our first question from Michael Phillips
with Morgan Stanley. Go ahead.

Q - Michael Phillips

{BIO 21023048 <GO>}

Thank you, and good morning, everybody. Thank you. Good morning. Thanks Evan for
your comments. I guess the first question is going to be on the future impact on the
wealth side from COVID in the coming quarters. And obviously without giving numbers,
but maybe just where you feel Chubb is most exposed to that from I guess a geographic
and coverage perspective?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

I'm not going to give any specifics in that, there will be -- it'll come from a variety of areas
as we imagine right now. And there will be the reason we didn't put up numbers in the
first quarter is because we're going to do it in a thoughtful way based on claims that

Page 7 of 23



Company N ame: Chubb L td
Company Ticker: CB US Equity
Date: 2020-04-22

FINAL

come in, that are analyzed and reported and then we're able to have a framework to
project IBNR with that in a thoughtful way as well.
But claims will come from travel insurance, and A&H will have business interruption losses,
where we purposely provided coverage as opposed to where we -- the vast majority
where we did not provide coverage, we'll have it through credit related that is surety and
trade credit, and maybe political risk who knows, workers comp will produce losses, I'm
sure.
And so, kind of gives you a sense, and it'll be -- I think it'll be pretty broad-based, because
it's created exposures for clients, for the industries, and the economies broadly. And it'll
geography -- well, over half our business is in the United States. So, I expect all things
being equal since our greatest exposure is in the US, by territory, the greatest amount of
loss will come out of the US and I hope that helps you.

Q - Michael Phillips

{BIO 21023048 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, it does. Thank you very much. You know -- I know Evan, you've been pretty actively
involved with -- in task force and things that are happening here in the US. And I guess,
clearly all the pressure from states on BI and states on workers comp and the big
restaurants that are there with Trump and things like that, all these different pressures in
the US. And not really looking for your one expectation, but just your thoughts on how this
all kind of shakes out in different scenarios on how the pressure on insurance kind of
unfolds? And what to expect maybe as this thing kind of shakes out?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

You know, the insurance industry is a -- is an important part of the financial plumbing of our
economy in the US. And frankly, it's part of the financial plumbing that's critical globally.
The insurance industry I think is performing quite well and I think it will perform very well in
meeting their obligations and our obligations. When it comes to business interruption,
there is activity that I put into two categories.
One is on the political side where there's talk about retroactively imposing cover on
insurers for something that they didn't cover and didn't charge a premium, that is
retroactively changing contract and increasing our exposure.
I think that's unnecessary harm and would do great damage, it would damage or destroy
the insurance industry in a terrible way. It would simply take money from one to give to
another who does not serve. And frankly, it's unconstitutional and we are a constitutional
democracy and preservation of that and the certainty of that in such uncertain times is
paramount. So I'd start with that.
Secondly, the insurance industry for the most part except for those customers who
discretely purchased it, BI insurance doesn't cover COVID-19. It covers and requires direct
physical loss to a property. And the regulators, who approved these forms, because
we're highly regulated, confirmed them -- confirmed that themselves, that it's not

FINAL

contemplated. Now lawyers and the trial bar will attempt to torture the language on
standard industry forms and try to prove something exists. That actually doesn't exist. And
try to twist the intent, when the intent is very clear. And the industry will fight this tooth and
nail. We will pay what we owe.
And finally, what I'd say is business interruption insurance. Actually, we should remember is
very good value for money, because what it does cover, we pay out as an industry,
roughly from what we can estimate about $0.70 on the $1 and every business inter -- for
every business interruption dollar of premium we collect in claims and that's pretty good
value for money. So thank you for the question.

Q - Michael Phillips

{BIO 21023048 <GO>}

All right. Thanks a lot of Evan. Appreciate it.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Welcome.

Operator
And we will take our next question from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Go ahead.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning, Evan. My first question I guess picks up on the BI conversation a little
bit. So internationally, due to the policy language typically follow the standard language
within the US, I guess you did mention that you could see some business interruption
losses from COVID. But should we think conceptually that the same exclude by with
exclusions would imply internationally as well as you attribute it to within the US?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Yes. Elyse, two comments. First, internationally it follows the same pattern generally which
is, it requires direct physical loss to property as a trigger for BI. And number one -- and
then number two, the exceptions are to that for Chubb are where we purposely
extended cover for different clients in different industries and purposely took on the
exposure. And in those cases, it's clearly defined.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay, thanks. And then my second question, you guys suspended your buybacks on
indefinitely in the language and -- the prepared remarks as well as your press release kind
of attributed to seem like economic uncertainty as well as just having capital flexibility.

Page 9 of 23



Company N ame: Chubb L td
Company Ticker: CB US Equity
Date: 2020-04-22

We've obviously seen suppressed prices throughout the insurance space coming off of
this COVID uncertainty. So can you just kind of provide us a little update in terms of
suspending the buybacks and how you think about just having more capital as well as the
potential for some M&A here, given that valuations are much more attractive right now?

FINAL

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

You know, Elyse, when you look at the historic -- and let's just look at this from a big
picture perspective. We are in the worst economic event that we have faced as a nation
and globally since the great depression. The economy is shut down. The opening of the
economy is going to take time and it's not going to happen in a smooth way and no one
knows for sure the shape or size or duration. No one knows with any certainty.
And frankly, to be buying back stock at that time, to me, is so clearly unwise. And the
fiduciary responsibility is to our customers, our shareholders, our employees, and I think
capital strength of balance sheet, capital and liquidity are king in this environment. And
those are attributes and strength you can't have enough of. And very fundamental, very
basic. And when there is visibility, and there is certainty, and we all have a better sense
then we will reassess.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay, that's helpful. Thanks for the color.

And we will take our next question from Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler. Go ahead.

Q - Paul Newsome

{BIO 1541286 <GO>}

Good morning. Thanks for the call. So first question, I was wondering if you could talk
about how you might see a really fundamental change in the perception of risk. I think it's
sort of hard and soft markets is happening, because of underwritings fee risk change.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

I can't really hear what you're saying. Can you speak up Paul? And --

Q - Paul Newsome

{BIO 1541286 <GO>}

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Q - Paul Newsome

{BIO 1541286 <GO>}

FINAL

My apology. It's hopefully that's better. I was hoping you could talk about where you see
the perception of risk changing in the insurance industry, given the current environment.
Where do we see underwriters likely changing how they do underwriting and rethinking
risk concentrations and such?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Yes. First of all, we're asking a question right now that is asking about what do you think of
the results of the wildfire when we're in the middle of the fire, this event is unfolding. And
I would urge you to think that way. It's not like it has occurred and now we're looking back.
We're in the middle of it. And so, some of the implications, it's too early to tell, don't
know. But the one thing I will say perception of risk as always occurs when a new peril
rears its head from the more academic to the actual. It has a powerful impact, and
impacts perception of risk.

Bloomberg Transcript

And in this case the last time we had that was really terrorism. And now in this case, we
will go through in a similar exercise, in some ways underwriters will. It'll vary by company
whether they actually had considered pandemic in their ERM modeling, which we do or
had not and really examine concentrations and how it impacts both sides of the balance
sheet. And then by the way, how you modeled and what the actual looks like are always
different. There's always basis risk.
And reality is always different than the laboratory. And this no different, but this is a peril
that the industry really didn't discreetly charge for, it's a peril that has no bounds in terms
of geography nor time. So it's a very different kind of cat and that has in a practical sense
infinite tail. So it will impact.
And by the way, no doubt in my mind, better underwriters had better control over the
exposures and underwriters who were maybe not as good will have many surprises that
will emerge. And time will tell, and we'll see that as this event unfolds. I hope that helps
you.

Q - Paul Newsome

{BIO 1541286 <GO>}

No, that's great. My second question, we've focused very much on the business
interruption issues and the political risks in the US, could you speak to how that may differ
outside the US? And I think, just some of the basics, I think sometimes you just don't know
how extensively it was included overseas and how the political situation may differ?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Yes, the overseas, we're not the -- in any one country, Chubb is not a large middle market
or small commercial writer. It's a business we're growing. And in most every jurisdiction, no
different than the United States, small commercial and middle market customers have
standard industry forms providing coverage in their country. They require direct physical
loss.

Page 11 of 23



Company N ame: Chubb L td
Company Ticker: CB US Equity
Date: 2020-04-22

FINAL

Most countries that I know of adhere that where there's significant concentration of
exposure for the industry, adhere to the rule of law and their forms are pretty darn clear.
Large commercial customers business interruption insurance is typically on a more
manuscript basis. And so, each customer's forms speak to a large degree for themselves
and in each jurisdiction, they'll be adjudicated based on the wordings as they were
drafted.

Q - Paul Newsome

{BIO 1541286 <GO>}

Thank you very much.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

And frankly Paul to-date, I feel more stability outside the United States on the regulatory
and legal front than I do in the United States, the irony.

Absolutely.

Hey, good morning. First question. Do you feel the COVID losses will impact your
reinsurance cover and you'll get some help from your reinsurance partners?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

Q - Mike Zaremski

{BIO 20606248 <GO>}

Okay. My next question, if I look at the North America commercial segment, and I heard
your commentary about exposure in pricing being at 10% I think plus and I'm looking at
gross written premiums in the segment growing up a lesser 6%. As there -- is exposure
shrinking in the North America commercial segment? Trying to understand the dynamics
there.

And we will take our next question from Greg Peters with Raymond James. Go ahead.

Q - Greg Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

Good morning. So on the call and then your press release, you reported $13 million of
catastrophe losses related to COVID-19. Then you made the statement saying this will be
tracked as a separate ongoing catastrophic event. So it's clear that there's going to be
losses and revenue and I'm cured -- revenue hit and losses related to this. Is the tracking
that you're going to provide going to give us color on both? And then maybe you can

dovetail that into the accounting geography of your announced premium reduction
programs, in the interim US small business to personal lines, et cetera.

FINAL

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Yes, well, I'm not going to give you much satisfaction on that question, but the -- nice try.
The loss part will be tracked. You're doing your job. So the loss part will be tracked as part
of cat. And that's what we report as cat. The revenue reduction from exposures, et
cetera, those will just come out in our published numbers and we'll give you as much color
as we can around it as we understand it or know it. We don't see it yet. But we know it's
coming. You can't have an economy. It's a common sense, you can't have an economy
shutdown and exposures are shrinking and premium is a function of rate to exposure.
So just a pretty basic there and that'll just be on a published basis, but we call is cat and
assigned to cat number is to coral the losses and distinguish them from this -- for the cat
event from what we would think is the underlying sort of run rate at the time.

Q - Greg Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

Got it. I had to try. But maybe --

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

I gave you a framework and I think that will help you.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Greg Peters

{BIO 3111497 <GO>}

I understand, and I do appreciate it. So I guess my second question, the investment
market has been clearly thrown into chaos. And so, I was curious if you could comment
one -- and I know you guys did provide some color in the opening comments, but just
some additional color around, how your approach to investing is going to change. And
then maybe also dovetail on the life insurance business, because a lot of that business is
a spread-based business and with interest rates at nearly zero, I've got to imagine that
the outlook for those types of businesses is under a great deal of duress.

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Remember, I'll just answer the life insurance part quickly for you. Our life business is not in
the United States, it's in Asia. It's savings and protection related and very strongly
protection related. And the interest rate environment is quite different. It's -- and so -- and
the minimum guarantees we provide are extremely low. So -- and you can see we
published it to you on our earnings on the international life business are pretty good,
grew nicely.
On the investment portfolio, I'm going to ask Tim Boroughs, our Chief Investment Officer
to give you a little more color, but fundamentally the changes we are making in
investment activity are tactical and not strategic and the fundamentals remain in place.
Tim, you're on.

{BIO 2284585 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes. Thanks. Maybe a little of context around, as you watch the fed, their response to the
markets has been I think very impressive. It's been large and historic and included the
purchase of corporate bonds both in the investment in the high-yield sectors. So, I guess
that one way you might think about our portfolio is that the fed is buying or supporting
with financing over 80% of what we own. So, I think in that regard we are in good shape.
As Phil mentioned in his commentary, we have made a few tactical adjustments to our
portfolio. I think this advantage of the dislocations that occurred in March with liquidity and
that included corporate bonds and equities.
And as Evan mentioned overall, I think that there's -- there remains too much uncertainty
on how the virus will progress and how quickly the economy recover to make any
significant moves off our current allocation.

And next we will hear from Meyer Shields with KBW.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Thanks. Good morning, all. We're hearing a lot of I think very legitimate opposition to
changing the definition of business interruption exposure. And it seems like a lot less
concern over expanding production within workers' compensation. Is that a fair read? And
should we expect that difference in attitude to persist?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

I'm -- say that again Meyer, the second part or repeat the question for me?

Company N ame: Chubb L td

FINAL

Okay. There's a lot of I think completely appropriate opposition to retroactively changing
the exposure on business interruption policies. But if my hearing that much pushback from
insurance companies about the fact that workers compensation presumptions are
changing a lot of states. And I understand the sort of emotional components of that, but
from an economic standpoint, how are you thinking about that change of exposure?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Yes Meyer, a very bright line distinction that should not confuse anyone. Business
interruption insurance, not the regulatory, the political activity around it where there are
those who are suggesting to retroactively change contract and add coverage that was
never contemplated nor charged for is very different than the workers comp, where I think
you're referring to healthcare workers and first responders, where there is the notion of
presumption that you got the virus on the job. That is not a change of contract, that is
something perfectly within the purview depending on the state of the regulators and the
legislator -- legislatures.
And so, that's within legal bounds to do that. And so, very, very different. And I wouldn't
confuse the two. And by the way, it varies by jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions right now have
all along said that, that a medical worker for instance who contracts an illness, it is
presumed to have occurred on the job. Whereas in other in -- for any other profession, it's
construed to be a general illness you could have gotten anywhere, and so it's not job
related. So workers comp is very different in that regard.

And next we'll hear from Brian Meredith with UBS.

Q - Brian Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Yes, thanks. Evan, so just curious, I understand the implications for exposures here going
forward. And do you think any impact that on pricing going forward be it -- will, where
companies lax up a little bit on pricing, given the economic strain or is it going to go the
other way, given potential increase in exposure?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

I think that the industry is -- has woken up to rate to exposure in the last year in particular
last year one and a half. And understands generally the need to get paid for properly for
the exposures take on. I don't see that trend changing. And I think this event is very likely - more than very likely, I think this event will be the largest event in insurance history,
wwhen you add it all up, both asset side and liability side of the balance sheet and I think
that just raises the specter of risk and the notion of managing exposure and I think it'll just
put a point on getting the right rate to exposure. So I think that absolutely continues.

typically pretty heavily supplemented?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

No, Brian, I'm not going into that level of detail and -- but what's very clear, the vast
majority of our policies require direct physical loss. And then the sub limits vary by whether
it's in a major account or it's a middle market or it's a small commercial client, it really
varies. And on both, what we offered and what they bought because we offer different
options.

And next we'll hear from David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. Go ahead.

Q - David Motemaden

{BIO 18818634 <GO>}

Thanks. Good morning. Evan, just hoping to get your outlook on D&O and other
management liability lines, mid-COVID and likely lawsuits, alleging misleading disclosures
and other things related to COVID. I mean how big of an issue do you think this is for the
industry and then for Chubb in particular?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Who knows. So I'm not going to overly speculate about that and I'd just -- but out of every
event and every event creates trial bar, ambulance chasing, drive-by shooting, where they
get most of the money and the supposed aggrieved to get very little.
I have no doubt that there will be COVID related D&O suits related to price drop and
disclosure, et cetera, and frankly it is frivolous, it is an unnecessary tax on business and
society at this point, it is a waste of time in terms of both resource and time and money
and Congress ought to grant immunity to business in some form against that kind of
activity, that is so counterproductive enriches one industry as the expense of an economy
that is trying to emerge, all stocks dropped broadly.
The COVID-19 was no one's fault and the foreseeability of it, no one is -- no one has that
kind of vision. And so, there's still the notion of buyer beware for basic things. And in my
mind, that's something that we ought to deal with and I'm glad you asked that question.

being greater in this environment as a lot of locals are working from home.

There's been speculation or talk about an increased cyber risk, considering that a lot of
employees are working from home. Do you see that as a large issue? And if so, how can
the industry address that?

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. And then the second question is probably more philosophical question. But I think,
you've seen several insurers as renewals come up, maybe articulate some of the
exclusions around pandemic and around COVID-19 specifically in policies. Do you think of
that actually could create an opening for the plaintiffs bar to go after a prior language that
was maybe less explicit in the exclusions?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

You know, I can't speak to what people's manuscript forms look like and therefore
whether they're correcting weaknesses with that value, I can't speak to that, but generally
no, I think COVID-19 or pandemic-related exclusions are just belt and suspenders on
policies, on the basic policies that require direct physical loss.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Okay. If I could sneak one -- other quick one then. I think in response to Brian's question if
we look at the vast majority of your business interruption policies have physical damage
trigger requirements. Can you say anything about what -- how many of your policies have
viral exclusions?

ahead.

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Hi, thanks. Good morning. I guess one more time on this business interruption. But I mean,
I guess one question I have is, should we -- is the real question in terms of business
interruption exposure, how many? Or is it how long is this lockdown happen? What's kind
of more relevant in terms of sizing that loss?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

FINAL

Is the question more about the number of policies? Because that's sort of what the
questioning and then so far that what percentage might actively cover the virus? My
question is, how dependent will that loss ultimately be? And how long the lockdown is in
place? Or in other words, are there other caps and limits on that?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

There are caps and limits in all policies and duration of shutdown, it's just axiomatic in
business interruption, that length of shutdown can impact and does impact severity of
loss, pretty basically any BI cover.

Q - Ryan Tunis

{BIO 16502263 <GO>}

Okay. Got it. And then my other question just taking a step back. I know you mentioned in
the general op ed that this morning that you think ultimately the industry will pay out tens
of billions of dollars in claims, is there any reason in your mind that you should think that
Chubb's market share of those claims should be more or less than what its global market
share is currently as a global leader in P&C?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I think, Chubb from everything I know, we're pretty good underwriter. We're pretty
buttoned-up disciplined shop. We have good controls within the organization and I have
no reason to believe that Chubb would produce something outsized.
Look, this is a significant event for the industry and it's going to be a significant event for
Chubb as well, it's an earnings event. It's not a balance sheet event as I said. And I do
think, it will be the largest loss, single loss in the industry history when you add up both
sides of the balance sheet and look at the capital impact to the industry.

Q - Larry Greenberg

{BIO 16478161 <GO>}

Thank you very much. I just want to be certain that I understand the accounting and the
intent of how you're going to recognize losses in the second quarter. So should we
assume that you will put up a catastrophe loss or what you expect will be your ultimate
exposure from COVID, recognizing that so much is changing and there's a lot of
unknowns down the road? But is that your plan?

FINAL

We will let the facts speak to us. We will put up our loss based on the facts as we know
them at the time, when we come to close the books on the second quarter. And I'm not
going to speculate ahead right now and we will then provide our perspective and color
around that to help define it and give you a sense. But I'm not going to speculate on
where we'll be by the end of the second quarter to give you a definitive color on the
question you asked.

Q - Larry Greenberg

{BIO 16478161 <GO>}

Okay. And then --

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Depends on what we know. Get used to being in a world with a lot of unknowns and a lot
of uncertainty right now. And you're requesting certainty when there's a great deal of
uncertainty. And a lot of that is for worksheet projection related. And I would caution
against trying to over speculate on any of them.

Q - Larry Greenberg

{BIO 16478161 <GO>}

Yes. I'm really not asking for any level of certainty, but really just is the intent to, do you put
a number up for what you, given your level of information at that given point of time for
what you can best estimate as your ultimate exposure?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

Exactly right. We will put up and we always do our best estimate of ultimate loss to an
event. We always do that. And I think it'll be no different here -- we're consistent that way.
So you can expect that of us.

Q - Larry Greenberg

{BIO 16478161 <GO>}

And then just curious on your thoughts on legislative proposals that might be productive,
probably just prospectively, but is there any conceivable model, where government
involvement would be helpful on a retrospective basis?

A - Evan G. Greenberg

{BIO 1444445 <GO>}

There is a -- I absolutely see a public private partnership, prospectively. I don't see the
sense of one on some retrospective so there is -- and I'm going to give you both very
quickly. The retrospective one would say well, why don't you pay the BI losses and the
government will back stop you 100%.

Page 21 of 23



Company N ame: Chubb L td

FINAL

Well, right now the government's current program to provide loans that then become
grants, if you retain your employees is a very efficient way versus now we create some BI
way and by the way BI insurance to adjust the claim requires that you prove it's an
ascertained net loss, you have to prove what your expenses were and what -- and your
loss of revenue and all of that and that's -- and the adjudication of that is messy and takes
time very, it's time consuming and it's one at a time.
And what matters right now is cash flow to small businesses. And so, it wouldn't be an
efficient way of dealing with the cash flow needs, the government's already created a
program, so what problem are we trying to solve. On a prospective basis, I see it
differently. Why doesn't the industry underwrite pandemic? Because of the size of the tail,
as I say it's an event that has no geographic or time limit. And so, the tail is so great.
The industry has a finite balance sheet that can't take infinite risk. If the government would
take the tail risk and take the significant loss on -- in a pandemic event, the industry I
believe, could take a retention and could be underwriting pandemic, a little very different,
but a little like think about TRIA and I can tell you I am in favor of a public private
partnership in shouldering the burden in the future and Chubb has put together its own
proposal and we will be sharing that around shortly with the appropriate parties, both
inside the industry and outside the industry.
