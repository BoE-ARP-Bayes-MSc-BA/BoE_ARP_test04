{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

Ladies and gentlemen, I am Nose, Head of IR. Thank you for calling in today in spite of a
busy schedule. I'd like to explain the results of FY 2019 and the business forecast for FY
2020, focusing on numbers.
With regards to the progress of the medium-term management plan, the senior
management, including CEO, will explain to the analysts in the web session scheduled
next week.
Now please turn to Page 2. Here are the highlights of the results. In FY 2019, we were
under the pressure from lower gain on sale of securities due to the rebound from
accelerating reduction of strategic holding stocks in FY 2018 and the impairment losses on
securities and so on.
We offset these downward pressures by the improvement of the base loss ratio of
Sompo Japan and organic growth, mainly driven by overseas. As a result, consolidating
ordinary profit was JPY192.4 billion, down JPY6.5 billion. Consolidated net income was
JPY122.5 billion, up from the projection we have shown you in November last year.
For FY 2020, we have included the potential impacts that are highly likely and it can be
reasonably estimated with high certainty, which amounts to JPY14 billion, while we
forecast for consolidated ordinary profit to rise by JPY30.5 billion to JPY223 billion and
consolidated net income to be JPY150 billion, up JPY27.4 billion year-on-year.

FINAL

To supplement the disclosure on shareholders' return we made public today, we have
decided to conduct the buyback of JPY35.3 billion, as you can see on the release, which is
60% total return ratio in FY 2019. We have also shown on the financial summary, the
projected annual dividend of JPY160 per share for FY 2020, which will make seventh
consecutive increase of dividends.
Please turn to Page 4. This page shows the overview of financial results of FY 2019. Let
me highlight main points from the next page. Please turn to Page 5. This is underwriting
profit of Sompo Japan. Core underwriting profit increased by JPY22.1 billion compared to
FY 2018, thanks to a decrease in impact from domestic natural disasters. Core
underwriting profit, excluding the impact from natural disasters also outperformed against
the November forecast, driven by growth in top line and the improvement of base loss
ratio centered on auto insurance, while impacted by the growth in long-term contracts of
fire segment, provisioning to underwriting reserve for natural disasters and the impact
from consumption tax hike.
Let me add that we have put an extraordinary provision of JPY10 billion at the end of FY
2019 to catastrophic loss reserve.

Bloomberg Transcript

Please turn to Page 6. Let me next explain consolidated investment profit. The investment
profit was down by JPY38.9 billion to JPY150.9 billion due to the rebound of accelerating
reduction of strategic-holding stock in FY 2018, impairment losses on securities triggered
by the domestic stock market declined towards the end of FY 2019.
Please turn to Page 7. Consolidated ordinary profit. Other than insurance underwriting
profit of Sompo Japan and investment profit I have just explained on previous pages, our
group companies centered on SI achieved organic growth, and Himawari Life had a
steady increase in the number of policies in force. And the nursing care business saw an
improvement of occupancy ratio as well as productivity. As a result, consolidated ordinary
profit was JPY192.4 billion, limiting the year-on-year decline to JPY6.5 billion.
Next page shows consolidated net income, but factors for the trend are the same as
factors for the ordinary profit other than the rebound from gain on sale of fixed assets in
FY 2018.
Please turn to Page 9. Let me move on to the forecast for FY 2020. We forecast
consolidated ordinary profit to be JPY223 billion, up JPY30.5 billion. Consolidated net
income is forecasted at JPY150 billion, up JPY27.4 billion year-on-year.
Let me go through main points for the business forecast for FY 2020 on the following
page. Please turn to Page 10. Main points of the guidance for FY 2020. With regards to
COVID-19, we have included the initial impacts that can be reasonably estimated with high
certainty at this point such as the impact from fluctuation of financial markets. On the
other hand, we are projecting underwriting profit to increase mainly due to the
normalization of the impact from domestic natural disasters and the rebound of onetime
special factors. In other businesses, we are expecting steady growth in base profits.

FINAL

Please turn to Page 11. Let me elaborate on the impact from COVID-19 on our business in
more details. What we have included in the guidance for FY 2020 as the impact from the
spread of the novel Coronavirus infection is the amount that can be reasonably estimated
with high certainty at this point. Specifically, we have included JPY14 billion impact on
consolidated net profit in FY 2020 from decrease in interest and dividends due to
financial market deterioration, payment of special allowance to nursing staff and so on.
The spread of novel coronavirus infection is still ongoing. So the potential fluctuation,
which may or may not arise, depending upon how the situation unfolds from now on is not
included in this guidance. For your information, let me just add that when we simulate
various scenarios with certain assumptions, then the impact could range from no
additional impact to additional JPY30 billion at the maximum.

Bloomberg Transcript

Page 12 shows the breakdown of consolidated ordinary profit. Page 13 shows historical
progress rates of quarterly results over the past five years, and Page 14 shows numerical
management targets based on adjusted profit. Please take a look later on. This
completes the explanation of the consolidated results. I will move on to the overview by
business segment, starting with domestic P&C.
Please turn to Page 16. Here is the overview of FY 2019 results for Sompo Japan. I will
explain each item on this page from the following page. Please turn to Page 17. Net
premiums written. Net premiums written has steadily increased by 1.8%, excluding CALI
and household earthquake, driven by increase in new policies centered on long-term
policies in fire and allied lines and the voluntary automobile line where we have positive
contribution from increase in non-fleet unique premium with product and rate revisions in
January 2019 and January 2020, respectively.
Please turn to Page 18. This is our loss ratio on earned incurred basis. With the impact of
domestic nat cat moderating, the loss ratio improved by 3.9 percentage points. Excluding
nat cat, loss ratio deteriorated slightly due to the consumption tax hike. But the underlying
loss ratio adjusted for these one-offs improved, mainly led by the auto business.
Loss ratio on written basis is shown on the next page. Please take a look at your
convenient time.
Please turn to Page 20. Now to the net expense ratio. Corporate expense ratio is steadily
declining, and we will stay on this course for fiscal 2020. Please refer to Page 21 later for a
combined ratio, the sum of loss and net expense ratio.
Please turn to Page 22. This is a table on the investment profit. How we did in fiscal 2019
was already explained using Page 6. Excluding the dividend income from Sompo
International as it is reconciled when consolidated, the net interest and dividend income
was solid, partially thanks to gains from fund redemption.
For FY '20, we expect a certain level of impact on the market volatility cost by the spread
of COVID-19 and project investment profit of JPY140 billion. Please refer to the next page

for net interest and dividend income, gains on sales of securities, impairment losses and
securities for FY '19.

FINAL

Page 24, please. This is the business forecast for Sompo Japan. Please refer to Page 25
for auto insurance-related data later at your convenience.
Now please turn to Page 26. I'd like to make some additional comments on the state of
domestic nat cat. Following fiscal 2018, fiscal 2019 was another year of multiple large-scale
natural catastrophes, including Typhoon Hagibis, which resulted in gross incurred loss of
JPY390.5 billion. Net incurred loss was JPY93.2 billion, thanks to the recovery from
reinsurance and less recurrence of damages from snowstorms. This result was better
than the November guidance.

Bloomberg Transcript

For fiscal 2020, given the trend with the recent natural catastrophes, we increased the nat
cat budget by JPY7 billion from the original projection made at the outset of fiscal '19 to
JPY60 billion. Please refer to the next page for details on our reserves. This will conclude
the domestic P&C part.
Next, let me move on to the overseas insurance business starting from Page 29. This is
the overseas insurance business. Adjusted profit for FY '19 was driven mainly by the
organic growth for Sompo International and Sigorta, and it grew by JPY17 billion to JPY50.1
billion. For fiscal 2020, we project JPY800 million growth on adjusted profit to JPY51
billion. This is coming off of a steady earnings growth, mainly driven by Sompo
International's direct underwriting business. Furthermore, we have also baked in the
impact of market volatility caused by COVID-19, low interest rate and stronger yen. On
Page 30, you will find the key points for respective entities. So please have a look later.
Please turn to Page 31. Here are some additional data on Sompo International's business.
All the figures on this page are in US dollars. Specialty insurance business led the steady
growth in increasing the policies, and the top line for FY 2019 outperformed our full year
guidance. Although adjusted profit was impacted by higher loss on crop insurance, top
line growth and improved loss ratio on the main direct underwriting business in the US
resulted in performance that was slightly better than the November guidance.
While fiscal 2020 will be impacted by the market volatility triggered by the spread of
COVID-19, we project profit growth driven by steady organic growth, mainly with the
direct underwriting business. Please refer to the next page for more numerical data on
Sompo International at your convenient time. This will conclude the section on overseas
insurance business.
Next, let's move on to the domestic life on Page 34. Now on Himawari Life. We continue
to enjoy steady growth on premium income, mainly thanks to the protection-type policies.
As a result, net income grew by JPY1.1 billion to JPY16.5 billion. For FY 2020, we project
growth on policies in force.
On the next page, you will find the waterfall chart explaining the factors behind the net
income growth. We have additional data regarding adjusted profit on Page 36 and
Page 4 of 14

detailed information regarding MCEV on Page 37. This will conclude the section on
domestic life.
Now let me turn to the nursing care and healthcare business on Page 39. Here are some
data on the nursing care and healthcare business. Occupancy rate, which is one of the
main KPIs for the nursing care business, improved steadily. Furthermore, we had some
cost savings, thanks to enhanced productivity. That said, the FY 2019 adjusted profit for
the nursing care business was up by JPY2.1 billion to JPY6.2 billion, which was significantly
higher than our November guidance.
For FY 2020, while we have reflected necessary spending to deal with COVID-19, we
expect the occupancy rates to continue to improve and project the adjusted profit for
nursing care to grow slightly.
Please check Page 40 for the trend on occupancy rate. That's all for the nursing care and
healthcare business.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let me switch the topic to ERM and investment. Please turn to Page 42. This is the state of
ESR. Despite the impact of the market volatility stemming from the spread of COVID-19,
we benefited from the sales of the business-related stock holdings and reduction in the
exposure to foreign-denominated assets at Sompo Japan.
In sum, the ESR at the end of fiscal '19 stayed at a similar level from the end of fiscal '18.
There continues to be no issue in terms of soundness. On Page 43, you will find a
breakdown of adjusted capital and risk amount.
Now please turn to Page 44. Last but not least, this is our investment portfolio for the
whole Group. In the following pages, we have more details on the investment portfolio for
Sompo Japan, Sompo International and Himawari Life. All the portfolios are conservatively
managed with a focus on stability.
This will conclude my presentation. Thank you very much for your attention.

Questions And Answers
Q - Masao Muraki

{BIO 3318668 <GO>}

My name is Muraki from SMBC Nikko Securities. I have two questions. My first question is
on the pricing, upward division of the pricing. SI has been dividing [ph] up the prices, the
premiums, how is the current situation on the pricing at the moment? And due to the
impact from COVID-19, in the commercial line segment, is there any impact on the
activities of marketing? For example, for the fire and allied, you have raised the premiums
up in Japan, but now you cannot do business negotiations face-to-face with customers,
and some customers are struggling with cash flows. But between Japan and the US, is
there any difference of the upward premium divisions? And again, related to the division
of premiums, how large is the increase of the reinsurance premiums this year versus last
year? So that's my first question on the division of the premiums.

FINAL

Muraki-san, thank you so much for your question. To your first question relating to the
division of the premiums up at SI. In 2019, SI increased premiums up more than they
assumed originally, they were able to raise the premiums by the low double-digit
increase. In the background, as you know, is the hardening of the market. We see the
progress of the hardening of the market. That's why for FY 2020, we are assuming the
high single-digit division of the premiums is being assumed.
And currently, the situation for the pricing environment is as follows, in the US and in
Europe, due to the lockdowns, for the first time, we are having online consultations and
negotiations and business meetings, which are not face-to-face. Although there were
uncertainties at the beginning, but now we don't see impact or constraint on the activities
and of marketing at SI.
And lastly, the premium increase of the reinsurance. For Sompo Japan, the cost of
reinsurance is increasing. As before, we cannot disclose the specific amount of magnitude
of the rate increase for the reinsurance due to the relationship with reinsurance
counterparties. But the magnitude is mid-teens of billions of yen, roughly speaking. I hope
I answered your question.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Masao Muraki

{BIO 3318668 <GO>}

Thank you so much. My second question is on Page 11. JPY14 billion impact, sorry to ask
you for this detailed question. But within JPY14 billion, what is the breakdown? With
regards to the exposure of SI in the United States, you have exposures to business
interruption and surety insurance lines of Lexon Surety, the firm that you have acquired,
they have credit exposure. I'm sure those are the two largest exposures. How large are
those two exposures within JPY14 billion? Do they represent quite a large portion within
JPY14 billion? And the range from zero to JPY30 billion, this additional potential negative
impact, is that due to BI? Is that due to Lexon?
And as the time to the end of COVID becomes longer and longer, is the additional loss or
additional negative impact are going to be bigger?

A - Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

Thank you so much. Let me answer the second question on the impact from COVID-19.
We have included JPY14 billion impact in the guidance for FY 2020.
First, for the insurance business overseas. At the moment, impact from the increase in
claims to be paid is not included. So as you discussed, BI and surety, for those lines,
please look at the right-hand side. This could be the additional potential impact that is not
included in the guidance for 2020.
And currently, for BI and surety, depending upon how soon the COVID issue will be
contained, there are significant uncertainties. So we are in the process of reviewing the
details. But based upon those assumptions, as you see on this page, in the whole Group,

Page 6 of 14



Company N ame: Sompo H oldings I nc
Company Ticker: 8630 JP Equity
Date: 2020-05-20

the potential additional impact for the whole Group will be zero to maximum JPY30 billion
additional impact potentially.

Q - Masao Muraki

{BIO 3318668 <GO>}

FINAL

I'm sorry, my understanding was wrong then. Then could the additional impact be zero,
too? Am I right?

A - Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

Yes, that's right. For the additional impact, it could be no additional impact.

Q - Masao Muraki

{BIO 3318668 <GO>}

Understood, understood. Thank you.

Q - Natsumu Tsujino

{BIO 2234779 <GO>}

Thank you. This is Tsujino from Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley. On Slide 11, including the
overseas business or even with the net claims payment, the additional impact of COVID19 could be zero. So in your case, you don't have big cancellation policies or business
interruption policies with a big exposure, but I'm assuming that it's a combination of small
size, the businesses. But for surety, it's mostly with the licensing businesses. So the nature
of your exposure is that it's going to be quite limited in terms of the COVID-19 impact.

Bloomberg Transcript

So if there are any exposures that you might assume some additional impact from
COVID-19, can you elaborate what could be those potential risks?
My second question is about the adjusted underwriting profit in the Japanese business.
When I look at the different numbers, for fiscal '19, I think the adjusted underwriting profit
was rather small because you had a provisioning for nat cat reserves of JPY20 billion, so it
was below JPY100 billion. However, for the new fiscal year, I think you're expecting a
recovery to JPY140 billion to JPY150 billion.
And you are not assuming a lot of new provisioning for nat cat reserves, in my view. But
there are other companies who are expecting a new provisioning of nat cat reserves this
year. Why are you not projecting that for your Company?
And I think last year, you mentioned that you are trying to improve the pretax profit by
JPY60 billion over a couple of years. I think part of that is reflected in the projections. Can
you elaborate what is included in your forecast?

A - Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

Thank you, Ms. Tsujino. So on your first question regarding Page 11, on the impact of
COVID-19, as you can see from the diagram, the additional impact could be zero to
JPY30 billion, and this includes both the positive factors and negative factors. So this
additional zero to JPY30 billion is a net of the positive and the negative factors. Also, if
positive factors could fully offset the negative factors, the additional impact will be zero.
Page 7 of 14



Company N ame: Sompo H oldings I nc
Company Ticker: 8630 JP Equity
Date: 2020-05-20

FINAL

And if the negative is bigger than positive, then we will see additional impact from
COVID-19.
And for SI, the business line, that could be impacted by COVID-19. As we have discussed
earlier, for surety, like you said, with the acquisition of Lexon Surety, we have exposure on
the surety policies and like you said, it's a license permit, which is not really exposed to
the economic fluctuations. So we don't have a major concern over this book. But in terms
of the business line, where we could see the potential impact from COVID-19, frankly
speaking, we cannot foresee how COVID-19 will be impacting our business at this point.
However, looking at the industry and also numbers coming from the other competitors,
event cancellation, it's not a big exposure at SI. So we don't have a particular business line
which could be exposed to a major loss due to COVID-19. That is our assumption at this
point.
And on your second point about the adjusted underwriting profit, the reserves for nat cat
in fiscal '19, we made some additional provisioning. So for FY 2020, we believe the impact
is going to be close to nil.
For the domestic P&C business, we have measures to build up additional profits. And as
we have been discussing, we are working to increase the rate and also optimizing the
allocation of our resources to improve the loss ratio. Those are reflected into the current
projections.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Natsumu Tsujino

{BIO 2234779 <GO>}

So does that mean that the roughly JPY20 billion is included in the projection?

A - Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

Yes, that is our assumption.

Q - Natsumu Tsujino

{BIO 2234779 <GO>}

Thank you very much.

Q - Kazuki Watanabe

{BIO 15948747 <GO>}

My name is Watanabe from Daiwa Securities. I have two questions. My first question is on
Page 11, impact on COVID-19. On this page, you are showing JPY14 billion downside risk.
Differently from other companies, you do not include capital gains or losses in the
adjusted profit. How much is the impact on the adjusted profit basis? That's number one.
My second question is on the shareholders' return. You have announced a share buyback
program. But for this fiscal year for 2020, are you planning to pay out 50% of adjusted
profit of JPY187 billion, which is JPY93.5 billion or more? And you have increased the
dividend by JPY10, is there any upside possibility to this dividend amount?

Company Ticker: 8630 JP Equity
Date: 2020-05-20

Watanabe-san, thank you so much. To your first question, on Page 11, impact from COVID19. On the adjusted profit, the potential downside impact, to be honest with you, the
assumptions are very soft at this point. Specifically speaking, on the adjusted profit, we
don't have the precise figure. And based upon JGAPP, how much will be the impact
precisely, we are not in the environment where we can calculate those figures as firm
figures. So that's why we are showing the range from zero to additional JPY30 billion.
JGAPP, adjusted profit, including everything, we are estimating roughly additional zero to
JPY30 billion.
And for 2020, shareholders' return policy, next week, we are going to have the IR
meeting, and the top management -- senior management is going to talk about it. So
please confirm next week from the senior management.

Q - Kazuki Watanabe

{BIO 15948747 <GO>}

Understood. Thank you.

Q - Koki Sato

{BIO 19983862 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

This is Sato from Mizuho Securities. I have two questions, and I will ask one at a time. Sorry
for repeating, but again, on Page 11, how we should understand this slide is something
that I would like to confirm. So this is the potential increase in the claims payment and also
various factors, and if you consider for that, additional impact could be zero. Also, I guess
your guidance that you have disclosed is a very optimistic guidance. Is that the right way to
understand these numbers?
And within the impact of JPY14 billion, you have the reduction of the interest and dividend
income. And also on the right-hand side, you say that there is a potential impact of
dividend and interest income coming from the stock holdings. How are these two
different? That's my first question.

A - Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

Thank you, Mr. Sato. So when you asked if our guidance is an optimistic scenario, that is
not the case. We have reflected what we can reasonably include. So any negative impact
with some high certainties. So those are reflected. And we are also projecting there could
be maximum additional JPY30 billion as downside.
So I guess you're saying that this could be perceived as an optimistic scenario because
we just give you the downside factor. But we do not see this as an optimistic guidance.
This is what we could reasonably disclose to the investment community.
And also on Page 11, regarding the reduction on the net interest and dividend income. On
the left-hand side, what is reflected in the projection out of the JPY14 billion, that dividend
and interest income decline is coming from the fund. So already, at the end of March,
when the fund performance is coming down, and for this fund where we could not
potentially expect a recovery, we have included the potential reduction in the net interest
income and dividend income, which is shown on the left-hand side.

Page 9 of 14



Company N ame: Sompo H oldings I nc
Company Ticker: 8630 JP Equity
Date: 2020-05-20

On the right-hand side, the interest and dividend income decline is mainly coming from
the Japanese stock holdings that we own. So if the economic activities in Japan
deteriorates, we could see a decline in the dividend income coming from our Japanese
domestic holdings.

FINAL

Q - Koki Sato

{BIO 19983862 <GO>}

Thank you. My second question is, Also this time, you have reflected JPY14 billion in the
projection. And if you adjust for that, then the adjusted consolidated profit will be JPY200
billion. And about six months ago, you were assuming that the reinsurance cost is going to
increase, but you would like to make an effort to achieve JPY205 billion to JPY215 billion.
Also this JPY205 billion to JPY215 billion that you were targeting versus what you're
projecting, what makes up for the difference?

A - Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

Thank you for that question. As you pointed out, Mr. Sato, if we did not have the impact of
COVID-19, our original projection for fiscal 2020, which was JPY205 billion to JPY215
billion, I think, was something that we were recently able to see, at least on the lower end
of this projection. But now we have the impact of COVID-19, so that's why we are giving
the projection that is lower than this original guidance.

Q - Koki Sato

{BIO 19983862 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well then, in that sense, so six months later now, have you seen any unexpected thing
happening, except for the COVID-19 situation, including SI?

A - Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

We have not seen any deviation from the original impact -- our original projection aside
from COVID-19.

Q - Koki Sato

{BIO 19983862 <GO>}

Thank you.

Q - Koichi Niwa

{BIO 5032649 <GO>}

My name is Niwa from Citigroup. My first question is ESR, Page 42. So I expected the result
of your calculation, which does not show a decline from March end. So other companies'
ESR is declining, but your ESR is not. So my question is, why has your ESR not declined as
much as other companies' ESR? Is that due to the calculation difference? Or are you doing
a better job, a good job of managing the operational risks in normal times. What is the
reason? That's my number one question.

A - Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

Mr. Niwa, thank you so much. To your first question about the ESR on Page 42, comparison
between us and other companies, I do not know for sure, but here's our take on our level
of ESR. We have sold strategic holding stocks. We made a very good progress on that.
And from the past, we have lowered exposure to foreign currency denominated assets.
Page 10 of 14



Company N ame: Sompo H oldings I nc
Company Ticker: 8630 JP Equity
Date: 2020-05-20

And as I explained at the beginning, we invest in the portfolio that is centered on the
safety first. So the credit-related assets are lower in mix. That's why there was not so
much or as much impact on ESR compared to other companies.

FINAL

Q - Koichi Niwa

{BIO 5032649 <GO>}

Understood. Thank you. My next question, you may have explained so maybe this
overlaps with what you have explained, which is about total payout ratio. The total payout
was 60%. Your target is 50% to 100% in the range. You have enough capital. But why have
you limited the total payout to 60%? Or why have you paid as much as 60%? How should I
interpret in this range of 50% to 100%? Would you please provide me with some color
behind 60% for the total payout?

A - Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Mr. Niwa, thank you so much. For the second question on the total payout ratio, in the
Company, we have discussed based upon the current situation about the level of the total
payout. As a result, we concluded on 60% because first, results in FY 2019 were up yearon-year. We were able to achieve increase in the results. In addition, impact from COVID19 on our business, although there are uncertainties at this point, but at the moment,
impact on our business for 2020 is limited.
We are projecting increase in earnings, and we don't need to raise capital. And the ESR
level is the level that does not impair the soundness of our business, and we have still
buffer for us to use to grow. So we discussed on the liquidity means, including cash that
we should have, we always check the liquidity level, and there's no issue with the liquidity
level. We can -- we are maintaining the enough level of cash. In the fall, when we revised
our guidance downward, we mentioned that JPY128 billion was the floor. If our business
result ends up being higher, then we mentioned that we would study the possibility of
paying additional return to shareholders, that's why.

Q - Koichi Niwa

{BIO 5032649 <GO>}

If you don't mind, I'd like to ask you one additional question. About the buyback, how
certain are you to exercise this buyback? As you explained, buyback is done for the results
that you have already achieved in the past year. So am I right in understanding that you
won't encounter the situation where you cannot fully consume the total budget for the
buyback?

A - Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

About the buyback, your understanding is correct. We have announced the buyback
relating to the results we have already achieved in 2019. So the buyback that we decided
this time is going to be executed with plan -- as planned.

Q - Koichi Niwa

{BIO 5032649 <GO>}

Understood. Thank you so much. I fully understood. Thank you.

FINAL

Thank you. This is Otsuka from JPMorgan. I want to ask first about the dividend. This year
for March 2021, you decided to raise the dividend. Why did you decide to do so?
And I guess, next week, the top management will be talking about the shareholder return
policy. But at this point, the two other competitors have not raised their dividend for this
fiscal year. So I guess, it's a good news for you to raise the dividend because that's a
reflection of how confident you are about the outlook. But as you have been explaining on
Page 11, you are also assuming some downside risk. And if you fully reflect that, your
business performance from March '21 could be flat over the previous year. But why did
you decide to raise the dividend?

A - Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

Mr. Otsuka, thank you very much for that question. And the reason behind the dividend
hike is, as I presented earlier, looking at our financial soundness and also the business
performance, at this point, we are not seeing any factors that will be impacting our return
policy. And also in the current midterm business plan, our return policy is to continue to
raise the dividend. So that's one thing that we state in the midterm business plan. So
given the current outlook, we believe that we are still in an environment where we
continue to raise the dividend. So that's the reason behind that decision.

Q - Wataru Otsuka

{BIO 16340098 <GO>}

Thank you. My second question is very simple and just a facts check. In the fiscal year that
just ended, your November guidance, which was revised, was JPY128 billion, but you
achieved JPY158 billion of adjusted profit. And I think both in Japan and overseas, versus
when you gave out the guidance in November, you overachieved both in domestic and
overseas business. Can you explain the reason once again why you were able to
outperform the November guidance for both overseas and domestic business?

A - Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

Yes. So compared to the November guidance, we actually outperformed as a result. And
for the domestic P&C business, as I touched upon in the presentation, we were impacted
by warm winter, also the damage from the snowstorm was more moderate than
expected. Thanks to that factor, and also with the loss ratio on other costs improving, we
were able to enjoy that benefit in the domestic P&C business.
And overseas, it was largely pretty much in line with the November guidance, but in the
investment profit, we were able to achieve some positive growth. So those are the major
items that impacted in the outperformance.

Q - Wataru Otsuka

{BIO 16340098 <GO>}

Thank you very much.

Q - Futoshi Sasaki

{BIO 17564798 <GO>}

My name is Sasaki from Merrill Lynch. I have two questions on the guidance for this fiscal
year. My first question is on the domestic P&C, specifically for the automobile insurance

line, your guidance for the profit.

FINAL

Looking at the current guidance, you're assuming the deterioration of the loss ratio. Since
the end of March, the traffic -- considering the traffic situation, I feel like there's an upside
to this. But how do you see the current trend? The number of losses reported, claims
reported, how is the progress? Or how is the situation for the number of claims reported?

A - Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

Mr. Sasaki, thank you so much. In the domestic P&C business, automobile insurance loss
ratio outlook for FY 2020, thank you for that question. At the moment, please go to Page
18. For 2020, we are assuming the deterioration of the loss ratio. And the reason is
because as I explained earlier, warm winter, and that's to be normalized. So rebound
deterioration from the warm winter, that's number one.
And as for the situation for the number of claims reported in April, as you indicated
correctly, the number of reported claims has decreased by close to 30%.
As I explained when I explained about the impact from COVID-19 on Page 11, on the righthand side, these are the uncertainty factors, including the automobile insurance line.

Bloomberg Transcript

So if the loss ratio goes down and in the automobile line, that will be the upside against
this factor. But that's uncertain at this point. So we don't know when the COVID-19 will be
contained. And is the traffic going to go up in a spike up or no spike up? We don't know.
So that's categorized as not so certain items on the right-hand side.

Q - Futoshi Sasaki

{BIO 17564798 <GO>}

Understood. Second question is on the overseas business, your top line outlook. For this
fiscal year, due to the hardening of the market, you are expecting the increase in the top
line. The companies in the whole world are seeing the drastic decline of the top line due
to the struggling cash situation. In that environment, you are expecting increase in the top
line. So when you revise premiums up, then there should be the fluctuation in the number
of policies. So how should I interpret this? What is your assumption behind the top line
growth?

A - Osamu Nose

{BIO 4205216 <GO>}

Thank you so much. The factors behind the increase of top line in overseas. At the
moment, in this fiscal year, as shown on this page, Sompo International gross premiums
written, increase of $323 million is assumed.
And as other person asked, for 2020, on average, we are planning to revise the
premiums up by about 8%. And as was discussed, many companies around the world are
struggling financially in this current circumstance. On the other hand, demand towards
insurance is increasing. So due to the lower capacity, the rate is coming up. So that's the
impact on the other side.

So we are projecting no impact from any deterioration of the top line in our guidance. But
as we pointed out correctly, there are uncertainties. Depending upon how the coronavirus
situation unfolds, there may be the impact on the business. So those items are listed on
the right-hand side on Page 11 as uncertain items.
