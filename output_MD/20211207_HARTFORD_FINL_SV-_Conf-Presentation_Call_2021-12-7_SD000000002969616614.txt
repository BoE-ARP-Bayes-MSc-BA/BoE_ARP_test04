Session started. Thanks, everybody for joining us. It's great to be in-person through all.
Thank you, to everybody that joined us virtually as well.

Bloomberg Transcript

With me today we have Chris Swift, CEO of the Hartford and Beth Costello, CFO of the
Hartford. Thank you, all for being with us as well. It's much appreciated.
So I'm going to let Chris, kick it off with some comments. Then keep in mind, we will open
it up for a couple questions in the last five minutes. So we'll take those at the end.

Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Good. It's great to be here. Thank you for inviting us. I don't think I've been here in two
years. So it's a pleasure to get back to 200 West Street.
Yes, The Hartford is in performing very, very well. We're living through a unique period of
time, but I'm really pleased and proud the organization has performed, has grown and
has generated, I think great value in returns for shareholders.
So we talked to you all our shareholders quite a bit during the year. I don't have any new
news or new information for you. But again just pleased with how we're executing our
strategies and how you really 10 years of effort to transform the organization is really
coming together to prove that the better days at The Hartford are still ahead of us. So
happy to take your questions.

Great. Thanks. So , maybe the first one, I'll start with just a higher level question about the
commercial insurance market, I just be interested in your views as sort of the state of that
market and pricing environment and where you see the opportunities?

FINAL

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

The commercial markets, it's a big market. So there's a lot of aspects of commercial
insurance where we deploy capital and opportunities, small commercial, middle, large and
global, specialty, and unbalanced. I think all of them are performing very well. Clearly,
we're living through a hard market, a rate environment that I think is going to continue to
allow us to get a good price into our products.
And that's principally because if you look at the environment, whether it be changing
weather patterns, whether it be inflationary pressures, whether it be supply chain,
whether it be just more adverse weather, particularly in property, I think all that leads me
to believe that the market has legs, as far as pricing increases, exceeding our last cost
trends for sure into '22. I think potentially into '23.

A - Unidentified Speaker
Maybe if we just go to the growth of premiums. You know, I think in recent quarters, it's
exceeded the renewal price increases pretty substantially as we've gotten the rebound in
the economy. I've just been interested in where we go from here in terms of the amount
of exposure units, it's been entering into the business. We see that over the next year?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yes. Well I think the context of it is, obviously we've lived through 2022 months of a
pandemic. When the pandemic hit, we felt in our top line, there's no doubt about it,
particularly in small commercial, where we had a lot of cancellations, endorsements and
exposures and just shrank, less so in middle but I would say middle market also
experienced some form of modest contraction.
So it's not surprising to us that given the rebound, particularly this year, we're seeing
exposure growth come back. That could be primarily, I would say in our workers
compensation line of business where we have fuller payrolls. Wages are increasing, audit
premiums and endorsements are coming back on, which all has greatly benefited our top
line if I look at small commercial written premiums up 14% roughly in the quarter over a
billion dollars.
We believe we're going to break through the $4 billion annual premium level which is
pretty good from a growth story. But again that is comp-driven, but it's also a spectrumdriven our new business if items are up 26% driven by spectrum you think is the industry
leading bop business owner's policy product. Retentions are strong. Renewal rate
increases are moderate, but again keeping up with trends. So in small, it's our crown jewel
and is performing very, very well.
In middle, middle in the quarter written premium was up 18%. If you really looked at sort of
the drivers in new business was up 26% during the quarter. So all of that is sort of a
Page 2 of 12



Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The
Company Ticker: H I G US Equity
Date: 2021-12-07

compounding effect that really drives written rent premium growth.

FINAL

Likewise in global specialty, I think we were up about 14% in total written premium in the
quarter. But again strong retentions new business growth are really powered by our
wholesale channel and our G&O [ph] product line there. So, really feel good about it.
In aggregate, I think commercial insurance will grow about loving percent for the full
calendar year or it's dissipating that. That's a little ahead of our forecasts. I would say
roughly that 11% is half exposure growth and half rate would be sort of a good rule of
thumb. So -- and we look forward, we see your growth, you're continuing in that 4% to 5%
range, which would have a compounding effect, or a CAGR over a two year period of
time about seven and a half percent. So, really feel good about the overall segment
performances in the commercial business sales.

A - Unidentified Speaker

Bloomberg Transcript

So I thought maybe we could -- you mentioned workers compensation. I thought maybe
we could spend a moment there. Can you talk about sort of the positives and negatives
there? I think you guys have talked about booking, last cost percentage of reserves. And I
think there's probably a lot of things to feel good about with just the quality of those
reserves and the strength that is there on the business you've written.
You know, at the same time, I think the price first loss cost trend is not what it is, and
some other ones have commercial insurance at the moment. So just help us think through
some of those positives and negatives. And if there's anything we should be thinking
about is, if we look at underlying loss ratios?

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yes. We talked internally. Yes, the pricing environment is sort of a function of the past,
right? The past was good. So, when regulators look at your filings in last trends, obviously
they're rolling back rate.
I think the key messages there, I would share with the group here this morning is that we
have deep expertise in managing different cycles, in the Workers Compensation
environment. It is true that if a pricing environment is under pressure, it was under
pressure last year, meaning '21. We see it continuing under pressure in '22.
But when I say that you got to break it down, small commercial, it's more -- I would say
structured. So, we don't have that much flexibility in small commercial. There's some with
class plans and you know (technical difficulty) approach customers with quotes, and but
generally it's -- you got to file your plan (technical difficulty) middle market.
We just have greater flexibility as far the ultimate price we present to a larger customer in
middle market and again history shows, we've been able to manage I think that's a good
outcomes, where we -- you know, trade off new business or trade off rate and retention,
(technical difficulty) plan in a consistent fashion.

FINAL

So those are all the components and raw skills that we have internally that will continue to
deploy. You alluded about the balance sheet. Why we feel really good about the balance
sheet is that we make, I would say appropriate loss picks for frequency in severity, both
indemnity and medical.
And we hold ourselves to that in both on a pricing side or reserving side. If medical
inflation is running hot, we have enough price in reserves up on the balance sheet if it's
running more lukewarm, where it is these days. Obviously we have the potential build up
some redundancies and release that, as that seasons from a severity side.
And if you would add anything else, Beth?

A - Beth Costello

{BIO 15349374 <GO>}

The only thing I would add, and I think it's always important when we talk about workers
comp because we do get that question a lot is -- and Chris alluded this is we're starting
from a position, it's a very profitable line for us. So yes, on the margin, there's a bit of
margin compression that we might see. But we still like the level that we're writing at.
And all of that is contemplated in the outlook that we provided. So, I know people tend to
want to go and dissect that piece, and sometimes I think read into that more of a
negative and I think (technical difficulty) is a very profitable line. As Chris said, we've been
at this for a long time; we know (technical difficulty).

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Unidentified Speaker
Next thing, I thought I'd ask you about is just in the small commercial business I think
results have been pretty favorable and quite consistent over time there. I guess I just be
interested in hearing about some of the competitive advantages, you feel like you have
to drive that success. So, how do you win in the market in that business?

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yes. I think Stephanie Bush, who leaves that business for us covered it very well in Investor
Day. So, I wish I could press play. And just you could hear her talk as opposed to me, but
I'll summarize what her belief is, is just principal architect of the strategy over the last five
years. It comes down to product in our digital capabilities. In other words, how we service
our aging customers, and then ultimately, the retail.
(Technical difficulty) and customer. You know, our product sets are deep, particularly
(technical difficulty). The overall package of capabilities, we have to face off with agents,
face off with payroll companies, alternative distribution, or even our direct distribution
capabilities all comes down to the product in that digital experience.
Equally, though, is important, I think is the coding experience. Agents or other
intermediaries have with us, we call that our icon platform. Industry leading based on just
years and years of data and analytics, that just drives a fast, easy and intuitive process,
particularly with spectrum redesigned. I would encourage you to explore the website
Page 4 of 12

FINAL

because you could do it on our website, but you could see sort of the Amazon like
interface of good better or best, other endorsements, you might want to add to a basic
policy and package.
It's actually very, very modern. So you put that then together with claims or claims
capabilities, particularly in comp and GL are unparalleled, I think in the industry, particularly
in small. It all still works to come together. But the fabric of that is ultimately all based on
data and analytics.
We see about a million quotes a year. So, how we process that, how we're able to do it
with speed accuracy, and deliver a firm "online" where you know, have to be referred to a
person underwriting. I mean you could just close out and hit issue. So, I think that
consistency, what's expected in from an agent or a customer experience you're very in
tune with.
And really what I'm trying to say Alex [ph], it's just not one thing. It's the whole package
and how it comes together. And as I said, I expect about $4 billion in premium. We'll begin
to thinking about sort of the future and how do we get the $5 million in over the years. So,
it'll be an important growth driver for us in the future.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Unidentified Speaker
The next one I have for you is on just the courts reopening. I'd be interested if there's
anything you can share in terms of the color, you're getting in this courts reopened and I
think everybody's focused on social inflation, what that all tells us about those trends. Any
color you can provide?

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yes, it's a challenging topic. I'm going to refrain from any lawyer jokes or (technical
difficulty) the pandemic, clearly there was a slowdown, but not stoppage but a slowdown
in activity, I think the courts went virtual. There was a lot of activities over WebEx and
things like that.
I think the key in this area is it really deeply understanding your loss costs, both on a
traditional basis, and what then could happen from a higher exposure. The context for us,
though, is, in particularly our standard commercial lines of business, which is small and
middle. Generally, our general liability and auto liability policy limits are in that two to $3
million range. So, we don't have a lot of primary exposure, we do write some access
policies frequently with some of the new capabilities we built. But even those access
capabilities have some significant reinsurance that would limit sort of per risk or per
events type of exposures.
But the key, at least in my mind, is getting them rate you need in that general liability, but
the commercial auto liability. You know, book to keep up with trend. I feel good about
where we're at today and what we've accomplished over the last three years. But I was
just down in Houston last week with some agents and really important to understand that
we need to keep up with trend better.
Page 5 of 12



Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The
Company Ticker: H I G US Equity
Date: 2021-12-07

And we can't afford this sort of wild swings were relatively more consistent. That
consistent mindset to me is you need to get six to eight to nine points away in a general
liability to keep up with that that inflationary pressure you call social inflation.

FINAL

A - Unidentified Speaker
Got it, thank you. Maybe shifting over to the personalized business just given the unique
aspect of in the relationship with AARP. Can you talk about the severity and frequency
trends? And what you're saying there and just sort of the update on how you're planning
to sort of restore profitability in the product?

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

I would say in profitability have been in decent shape. I'll explain why. So, I don't view it as
a complete restoration. I view it as keeping up with some of the recent trends that are
emerging with supply chain and broad-based inflation. But I think the larger context is,
look, our personalized business is 90% AARP-based. What do I mean by that? We enjoy a
30 year endorsement as the exclusive home and auto provider for AARP members.

Bloomberg Transcript

I think historically, and even today we know how to market it to the AARP membership
base. We know how to present a value proposition that AARP members enjoy. With our
new contractual relationship where we renew our contract for 10 years, we really
modernized a lot of components of the program that really need modernizing.
I think the classic one that comes to mind is old contract, old products we're 12 months
with guaranteed renewability, not price, but guaranteed renewability, or we call that that
lifetime continuity agreement, both auto and home. Really what that meant the way we
needed to operate with, was very cautious of who we let in the front door, in essence,
because we knew we had to provide them at least a quote, on a renewal basis every 12
months.
And it's different than in some of our other -- you know, called mass market competitors
where they had six months policies. If quite honestly, they could prune their book quicker
and faster than we could.
So again we've modernized that. We're modernizing it with a digital chassis, 64% of AARP
members start their experience with us online. So digital is more and more important,
particularly as we target the 50 to 65 year olds, where they might have useful set at
home on those lines. Then lastly, we're overlaying advanced telematics to ultimately
helping the underwriting and basically policyholder behavior.
So we feel good that all the pieces are coming together to really modernize and
transform that product line because, again it's not mass market. It is a targeted market. I
think it's more efficient, the way we go to market and how we get customers to quote
and ultimately buy. We still like that segment, because long-term, I think it will continue to
outperform the mass market.

FINAL

I think the point that you mentioned on profitability is, you know clearly there are
inflationary pressures that are affecting both the home and auto marketplace. I think in our
particular case, we're starting from a stronger position. Because we did less discounting
during the pandemic. We did one 15% rebate early on in the pandemic. We didn't do
anything beyond that. We didn't discount heavily on new business. We didn't discount
heavily on the enforce on renewal.
And if you look at the trends over the last six or eight quarters, we've been able to get
two to three, four points a rate into the auto book. So that again our starting point, would
say his rate adequate given the inflationary pressures, but it is closer to the rate adequate
than we think a lot of our competitors. Nonetheless, it we're going to have to go after
your rate fairly meaningfully in 2022 in auto and home.
We have some inflationary indexes inbuilt into some of our products, particularly home in
a little bit in auto in certain states. So there's some built in relief rate pressure from an
indexing side, but it will still be an effort to make sure we're keeping up with last cost
trends in all our major things.

A - Unidentified Speaker
Shifting gears over to the group business, there were a lot of questions on your call
around the mortality trends and the IBNR that was booked that just hit just as any update
for us there?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

You're discussing mortality, huh? My favorite topic.

A - Unidentified Speaker
Unfortunately.

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Unidentified Speaker
Unfortunately, you have, yes.

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

No, it's real. You know, that has said look, as I said repeatedly, there's nothing structurally
wrong with the benefits business. Except we're still in a pandemic, and we need to just
manage it in the best way we can. But again the structural soundness I think has never
been better. I'll share why.
I think the punch line on mortality is I think I said in the earnings call and maybe on Investor
Day but predicting mortality sort of an expected the actual basis where you usually attract

Page 7 of 12



Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The
Company Ticker: H I G US Equity
Date: 2021-12-07

your expected mortality best, and what actually emerges. From various causes it's been
never more challenging than it is the last 2020 months. It's not getting any easier.

FINAL

So as we sit here today everyone was talking about, how you say I caught army from.
What's going to happen with Delta. How many vaccinations can people still really be
encouraged to get as a protected the society in general. Those are all those debates. But
that I think are going to continue in the next couple quarters.
That said, I give you two updates and data points, our Third Quarter I've been -- our
estimates continue to hold. So, I think we made the right judgments particularly led by
Beth and her actuarial team in the Third Quarter and those are holding.

Bloomberg Transcript

As we look into the Fourth Quarter, there's a wide range of outcomes. So, I just have to
say a wide range. I'll try to narrow it to where I think it's the tightest. I'll give you the
datasets and the points that we're seeing to help shape that numbers. But bottom line,
where we stand right today where we're seeing October results, we've seen November
results. November is really in the tour because it's generally, Beth, best I would say there's
a two to four week reporting lag. So, November is immature. October is more of a tour.
But the punch line is we see for the quarter about 150 million. It's a 190 million pretax
losses due to mortality. That is based on a point estimate of 110,000 U.S. deaths from
that U.S. COVID deaths. We add in a factor for non-COVID deaths, excess mortality due
to the non-COVID. We put those two numbers together and that's how we come up with
that range. So , I think I said before, Alex, just anticipate your question, on 2022 we'll give
you our point of view in 2022 in February when we report your end results and update our
drivers.
Beth, would you add anything?

A - Beth Costello

{BIO 15349374 <GO>}

No. I think you covered on all the points. Implicit in that is we are seeing we look at
October, numbers coming down from the piece that we saw in August and September.
And as Chris said November's early. So there's a lot of estimation that goes into all that.
Obviously we'll look at actual results right through the end of the year and a little bit
beyond that to make our final judgment for the quarter.

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

I'll give you two others other data points, just in case you're interested and if you want to
encourage loved ones or family members to think about vaccines. This is primarily our
death claims, since really the Second Quarter, 90% of the dollars are going to people
below 65 and the majority unvaccinated.
It's there's tools. We feel good about where things are going, particularly with vaccinations
and therapeutics and things like that. But a lot of this could have been avoided. As Beth
said, we are seeing declines. I think the data I gave you, in prior public forums was we're
seeing about a 25% to 30% decline from our August and September levels.
Page 8 of 12



Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The
Company Ticker: H I G US Equity
Date: 2021-12-07

That point -- that mid-range at that point estimate, compared to our total Third Quarter
losses would be about a 27% decline in total losses Third Quarter to Fourth Quarter if
those estimates hold. So, trending in the right way. But as we said before, it's probably
another quarter or two before this really lightens up significantly.

FINAL

A - Unidentified Speaker
Thanks for the comments. Nice. The next one I have for you is on navigators, keep
providing an update on that business, how it's performing. And maybe also just any
comments you can make on the reserves and the adverse development covered that's
there?

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

But if I talk about the Ziani [ph], talk about the ADC. So, in total amount, I'm ecstatic, it
would be navigators deal; I thought it was a great cultural fit, great talent, and we picked
up, we picked up additional distribution, primarily wholesale. We picked up additional
product sets, particularly environmental access casualty, additional strength in E&L, Z&L.
And after two, two and a half years of integration, I think we're in great shape. Evidenced
by the numbers in the strong growth that we're seeing, and the profit improvement that
we've made in this book of business.
In terms of course just the deal metrics we're outperforming our overall deal metrics,
whether it be cross sell, whether it be expense savings, whether it be profitability, and
then ultimately, through the end of '22 we're on track to achieve double digit ROI, which
again are better than our deal metric assumptions heading into it. So, I think it's fitting well.
I think we're respecting the wholesale distribution, which is an important channel; it's a $5
billion book of business.
Then the teams are just really working well with a quarterback mentality to physically
account wound to bring more specialty products into the equation to be given
opportunities to talk to our agents and brokers about how we can make their life easier.
You know, when we offer them more products.
Again down in Houston with our agents and brokers received great feedback, as far as
what is happening on an overall account basis with our package capabilities, and then
adding in all the specialty capabilities that we've built and or acquired for navigator. So
really, really pleased with the acquisition.

A - Beth Costello

{BIO 15349374 <GO>}

Yes. I totally agree. On a specific question on the ADC, and we purchased the ADC upon
the acquisition because we knew and felt that there was potential for adverse
development and in some of those lines that we have experienced that. We're almost
through the ADC that we purchased.
And again stepping back from it when I put the reserves of navigators, kind of in context
of the whole Harford is really becoming a smaller piece. But there obviously has been
some volatility there. We continue to do very thorough reserves reviews every quarter
Page 9 of 12



Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The
Company Ticker: H I G US Equity
Date: 2021-12-07

and our practices, if we do something will react to it. But very, very happy that we
purchased the ADC. You know, initially.

FINAL

A - Unidentified Speaker
So next, what I have for you in the mutual funds business. You know, I think in my view, this
is a business where scale does matter, quite a bit. I think we get the question frequently,
like is there a need to either make a decision to buy and build around it or to potentially
sell it to somebody that has more scale. I mean I just be interested in your reaction to
that, any comments you have around Hartford is, and you need to take any action there.

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yes, it's a business that I would say has scaled today. It basically has about 150 billion of
AUM, primarily, retail mutual fund AUM, some advised by Schroders and in Wellington. Our
distribution is three distribution channels. So, we're focused, I think what we have stripe,
particularly with the independent advisors, the wire houses, and then 401(k) clients.

Bloomberg Transcript

As far as how we think about the investment, I'll give you a couple of data points. One, 10
years ago that business was making about 90 or ahead about $90 million after tax profits.
I would say 50% of it came from Talcott, or the old life annuity operations of the Hartford.
You know, today it's going to make over $200 million by the end of this year.
And 10% of its assets are AUM is called Talcott related. So, it is really been able to grow
dramatically both core equity, active, passive, and then fixed income capabilities. It's our
highest ROE business. We get a strong dividend from it. It's growing. It's relevant. It's a
type of investments we'd like to hold for long-term, Beth.

A - Beth Costello

{BIO 15349374 <GO>}

Yes. And I think it's important to, just remember, it is a unique model. So, I think
sometimes when we're asked about scale, and people look at the AUM, they're
comparing that to large mutual fund companies. This is very different. This is really, as
Chris said, and more about the distribution where the product origination coming from
Wellington and Schroder.
So just really pleased with the trajectory that has been on, that we just had a review with
the team there, and their plans going forward. And as Chris said, it produces a very good
return for us and provides cash flow to the holding company.
And the other thing too, I would like to point out is it's not a distraction either, right? It is a
self-contained group. It's not using a lot of our time, like other businesses that we had
that were non-core that took up a lot of our time. This is very different from that and run
very differently.
So we have a few minutes left. Are there any questions so we can take from the
audience?

Unidentified Participant: Hi, yes just curious in your group disability book, what your
thoughts are on possible paid family leave and how that might regulation that might
change the market that you're looking at there?

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

FINAL

I can't hear the question.

A - Unidentified Speaker
One more time.
Unidentified Participant: In your group disability book, how might changes to pay family
regulation, change the market?

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yes. I think it is based on D.C. The way we follow it is it's back and forth. It's in right now.
But certain senators, I think led by Manchin of West Virginia, I think are trying to take it out.
We've, through our trade group; have been obviously pointing to private market solutions
as opposed to government solutions. I think they're sensitive to that.

Bloomberg Transcript

But I don't know how it's going to come out, honestly. I had to handicap it. I would
handicap it is coming out and not part of the package and what again the private market
or state-based solutions continue to grow and develop from there. That's where I would
handicap it right now.

A - Unidentified Speaker
And do we have any other questions? Otherwise we can wrap things up. Anyone more
here?

Q - Unidentified Participant
Hi, you mentioned that actual versus expected mortality right now felt like it was harder to
predict than any time in history and physical over the medium term. That might be the
same case. I wonder if you can -- does that feed back into a pricing opportunity over time
and the competitive market? Thank you.

A - Chris Swif t

{BIO 3683719 <GO>}

Yes. It needs to. So yes, I think what we've experienced, particularly the length of it, if a
pandemic sort of morphs into epidemic, and just mortality is elevated for the foreseeable
future, we're going to have to start to take pricing actions and we're studying and
developing our points of view right now, particularly for the 1123 renewals are new
business opportunities, and that would both be life, it would be leave based on the
number of claims that were getting in on a lead management basis in SPD [ph].
So yes, that is front and center. We'll have to see what the -- how the broad based market
views it, before the only one having those views that would be challenging for us to
Page 11 of 12



Company N ame: H artford Financial Services Group I nc/The
Company Ticker: H I G US Equity
