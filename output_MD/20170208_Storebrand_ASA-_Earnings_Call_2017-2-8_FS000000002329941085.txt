Welcome to the Storebrand's Fourth Quarter Conference Call. My name is Anna and I will be your
coordinator for today's meeting. For the duration of the call, you will be in listening-only. However,
at the end of the presentation, you will have opportunity to ask questions.
I will now hand you over to Kjetil Krøkje to begin today's conference. Thank you.

Kjetil Ramberg Krøkje
Yes. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to Storebrand's fourth quarter 2016
conference call. I'm Head of Investor Relations of this program. And together with me today I have
Group CEO, Odd Arild Grefstad, CFO, Lars Løddesøl, Finance Director, Sigbjørn Birkeland, and
Head of Economic Capital, Trond Finn Eriksen.
In the presentation today, Odd Arild will give an overall view of the development in the fourth
quarter and the full year and Lars will give some more details on the numbers and some special
elements in the results. The slides will be similar to the analyst presentation released this morning
and are available on our webpage.
And after the presentation, the operator will open up for questions. To be able to ask questions,
you will need to dial in to the conference call.
With that for introduction, I will leave the work to Storebrand's CEO, Odd Arild Grefstad, who will
start the presentation on slide 2.

Odd Arild Gref stad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Thank you, Kjetil. This year, Storebrand celebrates its 250th anniversary and it goes without saying
that you don't survive that long without being sustainable. Therefore, it's a pleasure to start off by
briefly highlighting Storebrand's strong performance in the annual Global 100 sustainability ranking,
which was published at the World Economic Forum in Davos.



Storebrand was ranked the most sustainable insurer and financial sector company overall, and the
second-most sustainable company in any category.

FINAL

The award makes us proud and it is important to us because it proves Storebrand's world-class
capabilities within sustainable investments. Sustainability is an important part of our commercial
growth within asset management and going forward, we will leverage this position to further
differentiate our brand in the retail area.
If we move to slide number 3 and turn to the results, the group result before amortization and
write-downs was NOK 912 million for the quarter and NOK 2,913 million for the full year. This is a
strong result which was driven by good financial results and reduced costs.
The growth within savings and insurance continues, while the guaranteed products are in long-term
run-off. This is illustrated by a premium growth of 16% within unit-linked in 2016 and a growth of
32% within retail loans.
The underlying solvency position is increased by 20 percentage points during the year to 144%
after the proposed dividend. This represents a normalization of our capital position. Therefore, we
are ready to resume dividend payments after several years of solidly strengthening. The board
proposes a dividend of NOK 1.55 per share for the year.

Bloomberg Transcript

If we then move to slide number 4, Storebrand's dividend policy implies a normal dividend above
35% for the group's result after tax, before amortization.
The board has previously signaled at least half of the dividend for 2016. After an overall evaluation,
the board proposes a dividend payout ratio of 27% of the results, equivalent to NOK 695 million or
NOK 1.55 per share. The board expects a dividend payout ratio of more than 35% of the results
for 2017, as illustrated on the slide. It is expected, a gradual increase in the solvency position going
forward, which implies a further gradual increase in the dividend payout ratio.
If we then move to slide number 5, transformation of the business model. This slide illustrates the
two-fold strategy we have been implementing consistently throughout past five years. Today, we
have reached an important milestone with the return to a normalized capital position and resuming
dividend payments.
However, the two-fold strategy will continue to be important going forward, with capital light
growth within savings and insurance, and capital release from the guaranteed back book, which
now has reached its peak capital consumption level.
Slide number 6. Let's go a bit deeper into the growth part of our strategy. To better illustrate the
underlying growth, we have adjusted the growth numbers for currency effects related to the
weakening of the Swedish krona. The currency-adjusted growth in unit linked results was 15%
compared with the previous year and 6% within asset management.
The growth within insurance was 5%. This is lower than our long-term ambition of 10% and is
caused by the shift of our shift from external distribution to a more cost-effective distribution. This,
together with the transition to a new disability pension product in Norway, implies a lower growth
rate in 2016 and 2017 when it comes to insurance.
Last but not least, 2016 was a successful year for us in retail banking. We grew our lending portfolio
by over 30%. The new loans are mainly placed on the life balance sheet.
Slide 7. To innovate, the customer journey is important to drive growth. Storebrand's functional
organization reflects the customer value chain. We use insights from sales front and customer



service to develop technological solutions, products and concepts that meet the customers'
demand.

FINAL

On the slide, some selected initiatives that we have implemented is illustrated. I would like to go a
bit deeper into the example on the far right. That's on slide number eight. Storebrand's mission is
to give people a future to look forward to. An important part of fulfilling this mission is to make
sure people get the pension they desire.
Today, making the right decision about your pension is quite complicated. You have to deal with
difficult concept such as risk adjusted returns and asset allocation. And many people have got that
mix for guarantee and non-guarantee pension certificates which further complicates the matter. At
Storebrand, we want to make pension easy for our customers. To help our customers make the
right decision, we have built a digital pension advisor based on our existing pension tools.
We have boiled down all the complicated stuff to a few simple questions and recommendations.
The two uses advanced data analytics to give personalized recommendation on the best action
available to give a better pension, based on the pensions unique mix of different pension
certificates and paid-up policies.

Bloomberg Transcript

The best action likely to converting your paid-up policy to a paid-up policy with investment choice
or it might be topping up your certificates with extra savings. We (9:31) purchasing tools into the
digital pension advisor. And after we have launched the advisor, we have seen a tripling of the
traffic and a doubling of the sales rates. That is very promising for the growth in savings going
forward.
And with that, I will leave the word to our CFO, Lars Løddesøl.

Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
Good afternoon, everybody. Let's dig into the numbers on page 9 and in the upper left-hand
corner, the result development is described in different colors. The red color is the operating result
and is the core earnings of the group, and it is satisfactory to see the positive development during
the year.
This does include the performance fees from one of our (10:25) global funds, which was NOK 45
million in the fourth quarter. That should be seen in the context of being higher at NOK 94 million in
the fourth quarter of 2015. So you can see, even with lower performance fees, the underlying
earnings is growing satisfactory in this period.
On top of that, we've had a very satisfactory financial result throughout 2016 in the lighter blue
area, and there has been certain special items that have impacted the results on a quarterly basis.
In this quarter, minus NOK 52 million in the green area, is primarily related to a shortening of the
write-off period for immaterial or IT systems, basically. So in a digital world, we see that the IT
systems that we invest in have a shorter lifespan, and we therefore decrease the amortization
period.
Earnings per share is strong at NOK 1.64 in the quarter. In addition to being supported by the
strong results, it's also supported by a low tax rate, which is a result, first and foremost, of sale of
certain properties which had tax liabilities connected to them. So by selling the properties with the
tax liabilities, the overall tax rate shrunk to 14% for the year as a whole. Solidity capital is maintained
at a high level and customer buffers are stable.
Moving over to page number 10, the solvency position of Storebrand Group, we see a very strong
improvement in the underlying solvency position, from 131% to 144%.



FINAL

On the following page, I will describe this development a little further. What I would like to
emphasize here is that while the transitional rules have decreased from 34% to 13%, with the
increased interest rates in the quarter, the transitional rules have less impact on the overall
regulatory solvency.
And if you look in the right-hand side of the same page 10, you see the sensitivities going forward.
And it's particularly interesting to look at the interest rates with a 50 basis points fall in interest
rates from this level. The solvency position without transitional rules will decrease from 140% to
130%, while the transitional rules will increase in value to 30%, which gives an improvement in the
overall regulatory solvency position. And the same thing is actually happening, if interest rates
were to increase, then the underlying solvency position increases to 157%, the transitional rules
decreases to 5%, and the total regulatory solvency is at 162%.
So, actually, to make this simple, the regulatory solvency is not going to be significantly impacted
by interest rate movements from here on.
Obviously, a significant fall in the equity markets or spreads or real estate markets could still impact
the overall solvency, but we are fairly neutralized from interest movements from here on. The
underlying solvency has strengthened, that's the most important point. And I would like to move
over to page 11, describing the development during the quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

First, we started off at 131% and then you reduce that by 3 percentage points, primarily due to the
fact that the stress under the Solvency II standard model was increased from 34% to 38% for listed
stocks in the quarter as part of that framework.
Then the interest rates increased which decreased liabilities and improved the solvency position by
15 percentage points, and the increased in interest rates were 49 basis points in the 10-year swap,
both in Norway and in Sweden. And then there are some twists on the curve in addition to that.
Then we issued, as you are well aware, the subordinated loan back in October which was SEK 750
million which improved solvency by 3 percentage points, ending up at 146 percentage points
before dividends. Then you can add on top of that these transitional rules which were, as I
described in the previous page, reduced by the higher interest rate, leaving us with a fourth
quarter solvency rate of 160% before the dividends of SEK 695 million which decreases that again
to 157%.
Moving over to page 12, we see the results of the group in the traditional schedule. Fee and
administration income was slightly down in 2016 compared to 2015. The run-off on revenues from
guaranteed business was slightly higher than the increase in revenues from the non-guaranteed
savings business and insurance business.
Looking into 2017, we expect that the total revenues will increase during this year. Insurance result
improved during the year and the operational cost was down quite significantly year-over-year. And
in actual effect, the NOK 861 million in operational cost in the fourth quarter includes about NOK
50 million in the special effect that I mentioned a little earlier. So the underlying number is even
better than this.
Then the financial items were significantly improved in the fourth quarter and last year over 2015
partly as a result of – or in the quarter the most important impact on this number was that we had
profit split in the individual portfolios in Norway. That is something we don't expect to see
additional profit split revenues in 2017. But gradually going forward, there could be profit split in
certain portfolios.
But in the fourth quarter, we had due to exceptionally good book return in the guaranteed –
individual portfolio in Norway, we managed to take out NOK 139 million in a one-off profit split in



FINAL

the individual portfolios in Norway. In Sweden, we also had very good return in, well throughout
2016 and in the fourth quarter in particular, both from real estate, from equities and from credit
spreads, which gave profit split also in this book. In addition, for the full year, the results were lifted
by a strong return on company portfolios, especially in the second and third quarter. Tax, I already
mentioned, but it was 17% in the fourth quarter and 14.5% for the year as a whole.
And lastly on page 13, this is basically the same numbers as on the previous page. But in the profit
per line of business, a box on the bottom, we see that the result improvement in savings and nonguaranteed and insurance improved during the year of 2016 and even in the quarter-over-quarter,
while the biggest, I guess, to some extent, a surprise to analysts and compared to what were the
forecasts out there, was that the profitability in the Swedish and Norwegian guaranteed portfolios
lifted the results significantly in the fourth quarter, which I talked about a moment ago.
And in other profit, you have the company portfolios and a number of small subsidiaries which had
a slightly weak result for the quarter. But overall, this line was strong for the year as a whole. This
ends up in giving us a result for profit before amortization and longevity of NOK 912 million in the
quarter and NOK 2,913 million for the full year.
And I will end my number exercise here, would be happy to take questions from any other
numbers or other questions you may have.

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Lars. The operator will now open up for questions.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. . I can see we have a couple of questions already coming in. I would introduce the first
speaker and Peter Eliot from Kepler Chevreux. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Just a little bit – the first thing I would talk, I was a little bit confused by the
complexity of the interest rate sensitivity. You've shown on slide 10 the solvency ratio increases.
This is with transitional rules, increases for both higher and lower interest rates. I was wondering if
you could just explain how that is the case.
And then, secondly, on slide 11, when you showed the sort of the waterfall, you haven't got
anything in that or the sort of underlying solvency in capital generation. I mean, I know it's more
than a quarterly basis, but can we sort of add something into that? So, are you able to tell us
roughly what is happening there?
And I suppose want to add a third one, I was wondering if you could just tell us the latest on the
payable tax, but without the rebate (20:40). Thank you very much.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
Well, on the sensitivity, you know that the transitional rules, they look at the liabilities under
Solvency I and the liabilities under Solvency II. They do not take account for changes in assets, only
in the liabilities. Furthermore, they don't take into account – there are not transitional rules for the
Swedish business. So basically, you have to look at the dynamics under Solvency I and the dynamics
with the liabilities under Solvency II and look at the difference between the two. Important factor is
that there is some complexity and we are at the low point in terms of the overall, how low it can fall
with interest rate movement, either up or down.



FINAL

A - Odd Arild Gref stad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

I think also, Lars, that it's important to say that you should expect actually while dynamics here are
seen in the fourth quarter, that interest rates of 50 basis points up should decrease the transition
rules even further. But the point here is that by this transition, the 50 percentage points up, it will
be out of the transition rules when it comes to interest rates. It's just some transitional rules that is
aligned to shares that is still on the balance sheet. So from this point up, you are really out of the
transitional rules and uplift in solvency is the same, of course, without transitional rules. So the 5
percentage points here is only the equity stress.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Trond Finn Eriksen

{BIO 17132188 <GO>}

When it comes to the movement of the solvency position, which with none of the particular slice
with such a movement and we have decided to slice it this way. One way to look at this stuff, you
could also apply this, so we showed show the quarterly results after tax of just about NOK 600
million, and that's corresponding to just about 2 percentage points of the solvency ratio attach. But
on top of that, you will also have solvency generation from express return above the discount rate
in the quarter. And that is built into – a lot of that is what you see in the 15% percentage points
increase that you see increased interest rates.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Odd Arild Gref stad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

So to sum it together or (23:24) what we gave as an estimate in our Capital Markets Day of a
normalized growth in the solvency position of (23:32) 7 percentage points a year, that is still a very
good estimates of what we expect in a normalized situation.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
That's correct. When it comes to finance tax and on the payroll area, we have, first of all, now
taken care of that into the balance sheet, so it's all implemented in the numbers we have at year
end. Going forward, we have looked more closely into the numbers, and our best estimate is that
this will increase our cost for 2017, everything equal, with SEK 55 million before tax. And, of course,
we work very hard, of course, to also reduce the effect of this in total over the year.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
Okay. Thank you.

Operator
The next question is coming from Matti Ahokas from Danske Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is
now open.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. It's Matti here from Danske. A question on slide number 4 where you have
the dividend, I'm a bit puzzled and I was hoping if you could clarify it a bit more. Obviously, the
payout ratio for 2016 was clearly higher than what you kind of originally anticipated, roughly half or
more than half of the normal dividend. But when you talk about, in bold, more than 35% dividend
payout ratio, what are the moving parts there? Is it the solvency ratio or are there – what should we
be looking at when we try to estimate what should be in 2017?



FINAL

And basically, how high could this basically go if you look at 2018 onwards? Are you looking for a
kind of graphically nice growing path, or how should we interpret this? And then just a figure
question on the guaranteed pension, the SEK 139 million gain in individual life and pension in
Norway, that I guess was related to the sale of the properties but was there something else kind
of one-off in the guaranteed pension effects?

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
It should be clarified within the reserved portfolio again as a starting point. The individual portfolio
in Norway, those are old tax incentivized insurance – sorry, savings schemes with guarantees. And
in that portfolio, we had a book return of above 6% and for certain contracts that meant that there
was a surplus that was profit split. These portfolios are profit split 65% to customers and 35% to
Storebrand and this generated a result of NOK 139 million for Storebrand and therefore increased
the – there was an allocation to customer of NOK 270 million or so.

A - Trond Finn Eriksen

{BIO 17132188 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. So this has nothing to do with the real estate portfolio. This is to do really with our
guaranteed business in Norway. I think what is a bit surprising is that we know already our levels on
these guarantees where we have a very comfortable buffer situation and maybe gradually can
start profit trading again. But we had a very special situation, we had high book return in this
portfolio in 2016 and that's why you should not expect this kind of element come back in this
portfolio in 2017.
An interesting discussion is of course also on the kind of policies that has – very much show the
same characteristics, where you have 80/20 profit split. And it's also clear that we start to have a
very good buffer capital situation for some of these portfolios. But in 2017, you should expect us to
use the surplus in this portfolio to fulfill the remaining longevity reservation that is now on a very
low level. It's of just NOK 350 million and we expect to then finish all the reservation for longevity
based on surplus return on these funds in 2017.
And that also leads me, actually, to your first question about the dividends. In 2016, we had now
dividend from the life insurance company up to the holding company. And that was because we
were still in a reservation process for the life insurance company to fulfill the obligation about
longevity. And as I said, we started this some years ago and had NOK 12.4 billion to really reserve
for. It's just NOK 350 million left now, and it will be completed during 2017.
But as long as we are in this scheme, it's not possible for us to take a dividend from life insurance
company to the holding company. That's why we also had lower than a 35% dividend payout in
2016. By that, we expect to lift that ban on the life insurance company during 2017 and also have a
much larger up-streaming to the holding company, and that's one of the element together with, of
course, the solvency position that is important for us to decide on the payout ratio when it comes
to the dividend.
And, of course, as we have talked about, we are now in a situation with a peak capital on the
guaranteed book of business, very much of our growth in the comp book is the capital light and
that gives opportunities to still, of course, do some strengthening on the solvency position, to
keep them that line solvency position about 150% gradually, but also to have a payout ratio that
should be above 35% as illustrated on slide number 4.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

The question obviously is how much above 35%...

A - Trond Finn Eriksen

{BIO 17132188 <GO>}

Yeah. Yeah, that is a very good question. We have tried to give an illustration here, of course, on
slide number 4 about what we expect in 2017. I think what we wanted to stress is that when we



have a dividend policy staying above 35%, it means above. And we believe it could be a payout
ratio at least higher than 35% in 2017, but we don't want to be very exact of the numbers on this
stage.

FINAL

And we also say that going forward, we see capital light growth. We see that gradually a larger
part of the annual results could be distributed to the shareholders as long as we follow the path
that we expect to do to build solvency of capital going forward.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Great. That's very clear. Just a clarification, what would you say is the normal kind of dividend that
you would upstream from the life company to the holding company? What level are we talking of in
millions of krone?

A - Trond Finn Eriksen

{BIO 17132188 <GO>}

We haven't talked about the level of it. But, of course, again, it's very much above the solvency
position. As long as the solvency position in the life insurance company is at the right levels, you
can expect to upstream a large part of the result of the life insurance company to the holding
company.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Great. Very helpful. Thanks.

Operator
The next question comes from Paul De'Ath from RBC. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Paul De'Ath
Yeah. Hi there. And I just wanted to clarify a point that I think you just made in the last answer, and
you're saying you're actually now at the peak capital point because I think at the Investor Day or
the Capital Markets Day, you talked about that potentially coming in 2018. But has that now been
advanced by a couple of years and what does that mean in terms of then the future roll-off of
capital?
And then, second point just on the Solvency II ratio and the fact that obviously the transitional
element has shrunk down quite a lot. Is there any situation in the future where you could see the
transitionals actually being a negative in terms of the solvency ratio, or would that not be possible?
Thanks.

A - Trond Finn Eriksen

{BIO 17132188 <GO>}

Just to be clear on the last one, you can think about the transitionals as a security in that if you have
falling interest rates from this level, you will still have a strong solvency position with transitional
rules because then the transitional will increase again. But you will never have a negative effect on
transitionals. Then you are out of the transitionals when you look at the underlying solvency
position and just that.
At peak capital, well, first of all, I think we are in 2017 now, so it's just one year to 2018. But anyway,
what has happened since Capital Markets Day is, of course, that we have – been a lot of rolling
forward efforts in the balances. But the most important is that we have seen an increased interest
rate level compared to what we had back then. And increased interest rate levels, that makes the
peak capital timing coming closer to us. And we estimate that we are at that level now.
Of course also, higher interest rates will also have something to say when it comes to the trail off
of this capital release, so to say, from the guaranteed portfolios. But I think we, Kjetil, we'll like to



come back on that on a later stage.

A - Kjetil Ramberg Krøkje

FINAL

It would be natural to have some more discussions around economic capital when we present our
first quarter numbers with some updated calculations from the economic capital team.

Q - Paul De'Ath
Excellent. Thanks very much.

A - Kjetil Ramberg Krøkje
Thank you.

The next question comes from Jonny Urwin from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a quick one on the dividends. So, obviously, you're talking
about the payout ratio increasing which is great. But, I mean, have you formally committed to a
dividend ratchet as well, because obviously earnings could come down, assuming the payout ratio
goes up and (35:11) dividend growth?
Secondly, just on the outlook for operating profits. So slide 9 as usual shows us the development
through the quarters. But it looks to me like there's about NOK 500 million a quarter of operating
results. Do you think that's a fair assumption for 2017 and beyond? Thanks very much.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
On the last question, I can confirm that the operating results have been fairly stable and slightly
increasing the last several quarters, and that we anticipate that to continue.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

So around NOK 500 million with a bit of growth then.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
Well, as you see, it has gone – it was in the second quarter at NOK 411 million, so it can go below
NOK 500 million as well, but in the area of NOK 500 million, and over time increasing that would
be our objective to deliver.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Thanks.

A - Odd Arild Gref stad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

When it comes to payout ratio or dividends, what we are talking about all the time is, of course,
solvency ratios and dividend payout based on results after tax and before amortization. And that
might create a situation where we have preparations in the nominal number of payout from one
year to another. That is what we are aiming on when we are guiding here.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Okay. But there's no formal commitment, not to lower the dividend?



A - Odd Arild Gref stad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Nominal number can be both higher and lower. What we aim to do is to have a payout that make
us have the right capital situation in the company at all time. And don't keep any capital on top of
what we need, I think is needed to run the business most effectively.

The next question comes from Blair Stewart from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is
now open.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thank you. Good afternoon. First question just on slide 12, I'm just wondering, of the NOK 924
million financial items and risk result in life, how much of that would you regard as genuinely one-off
and assuming we just had a normal financial market, sell-off (37:50) conditions, what should that
number be very roughly in your own modeling?

Bloomberg Transcript

The second question is on the loan growth that's now being transacted into the life business. I just
wonder what's the return on those loans and what assumptions are you making for defaults over
time? And then on the capital levels, I noticed that your solvency capital requirements actually went
up quarter-on-quarter from 23.8 to 24.2, 24.3. Just with relation to the comment about peak
capitalization or peak capital level, I just wondered if you could comment on that.
And I have also noticed that if you take out the transitionals the reconciliation reserve is practically
doubled in the last year from NOK 12 billion up to just over NOK 20 billion. And that's presumably is
just enforced value, is that simply the gear into interest rates? Thank you.

A - Trond Finn Eriksen

{BIO 17132188 <GO>}

If I could start on the solvency questions, Blair. First of all, the increase in Solvency capital
requirement is very much related to increased equity stresses from 34 to 38 for type I and from
44 to 48 for type II. So that's very much really comes to the increase in reconciliation of reserve.
Yes, you're right it's a lot that related to interest rates, some of the decrease in liabilities and all
technical provisions due to increased interest rates.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

It's a very big number, Trond, and from 12% to 20% interest rates, have gone up by about 50 basis
points over the year, if I'm not wrong.

A - Trond Finn Eriksen

{BIO 17132188 <GO>}

It's actually over (39:57) but it's actually not that much of. I have to look a little bit more into that
number, Blair, before giving you – but I'll return to you with a more detailed answer to that.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Yes. Probably other factors, current spreads, exit markets, et cetera, but it'd be useful to know.
Thank you.

A - Odd Arild Gref stad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

I think you have to be that because if you look year by year, the interest rate movement has been
marginal actually.



A - Trond Finn Eriksen

{BIO 17132188 <GO>}

Yeah. It's been quite heavy outperformance in the portfolios in most markets which will contribute
to that. And especially real estate with strong returns and credit business.

FINAL

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

I'm just wondering, because you don't publish an embedded value report anymore and I'm just
trying to get a feeling for whether there's been changes in your assumptions as to the future of
profitability of the book.

A - Trond Finn Eriksen

{BIO 17132188 <GO>}

No. It's actually the assumptions changes, the model changes over the year, it's close to zero.
There has been a lot of underlying changes, but they are really not that (41:08).

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thank you.

A - Trond Finn Eriksen

{BIO 17132188 <GO>}

Shall we then move to the operating results, Lars.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. On the financial items and the NOK 924 million, that's a combination of the profit split that we
saw in Norway and Sweden, especially in the fourth quarter, as I mentioned before.
And in the Norwegian market, you should not expect a profit split in the next few years. In the
Swedish market, with normalized returns, the normalized or the expected returns will be slightly
higher than what you run up in the solvency curve or a discount curve, and therefore you should
have, on a normalized basis, a positive result from the Swedish guaranteed business.
And the last major item here is the company portfolios and the returns there. When interest rates
in Sweden rate are around zero, you should expect to run zero in the financial result from the
Swedish portfolio, while in the Norwegian portfolio, there is a positive return, but much lower than
it has been during 2016 where we've had a credit spread contraction which has contributed to
extraordinary results.
So there are several moving parts here, especially short-term interest rates that will impact this
number, as well as developments in different asset classes. But if you take very much like a
normalized approach to this, then expected number is around one-third of this number.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Yeah. Okay. That's what I was getting to. What would be the investment income, the expected
investment yield on the company portfolio in Norway?

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
Well, in Norway, the short-term interest rate is around 1%, so maybe between 1% and 1.5% and in
Sweden around 0%.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Yes. I got the Swedish part. That's great. Thanks very much. And on the loans, a very big increase in
the loans?



FINAL

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
Yeah. It's a large increase in the loan. And it's an important part for us also to really get our
business to consumer subsidy going because we see that on top of the loans, we get, of course,
deficits from our customers and we also get the cross-sell going into more risk products and also
savings products. So this is an important part of also the whole retail structure here overall. But we
have a return on equity target for our banking access, is standalone of 10%, above 10% after tax.
And when we price our loans, it's also based on – I'm sure that we will reach 10% return on equity
target as such.
I'll also add that if you look at loan to value on this book, it's for more (44:16) in Norway. Historically,
I will say the last – well, as long as we have been doing loans in Norway, at least in close to zero in
losses in this portfolio. Of course, we have our models taking account for some losses. But still,
with loan to value that'd be (44:42) here and specially what we're also put in the life insurance
balance sheet, it's very limited as we view it, a risk of heavy losses in such a portfolio.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

So did you give the loan to value number?

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
What we put on the life balance sheet, I think it's below 70%.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Trond Finn Eriksen

{BIO 17132188 <GO>}

Yeah. Once it goes in the balance sheet of life company, it's less than 70%, and that is most of the
growth as you see.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Sorry, to ask you again, but as an asset for the life company, what was the yield on the asset?

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
You have to look at the yield for the life company as compared to buying covered bonds or similar
asset classes, and this gives a good solvency capital adjusted return compared to similar asset
classes.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Yeah. I would expect there'd be a good return. Yeah. Have you prepared to say what the yield is?

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
Well, basically, we're now lending at around 2% and they're paying about 40 basis points to the
bank to administer these loans, so then you end up with 1.6%.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay. But obviously, very low levels of capital.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
Yes. Yeah.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. Sorry for asking so many questions. Thank you.



A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
No, fine.

FINAL

Operator
The next question comes from Peter Eliot from Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead. Your line is
open.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Actually, I thought I'd canceled mine. I think, my question was answered. Thanks a lot.

Operator
Then we take the next question from Jonny Urwin from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is now
open.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Thanks a lot. Just a quick clarification on the capital generation. So you're sticking to the 5% to 10%
guidance. And at the top end of that, we'll expect like an organic build of sort of 6% to 7% post
dividend, is that right?

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl

Bloomberg Transcript

That's right.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Thank you.

Operator
There are no further questions coming through so we'll hand the call back. Thank you.

A - Kjetil Ramberg Krøkje
Then I would like to thank all of you for following the call and wish you all a pleasant afternoon.

Operator
Thank you for joining today's conference. You may now replace your handsets to end the call.
