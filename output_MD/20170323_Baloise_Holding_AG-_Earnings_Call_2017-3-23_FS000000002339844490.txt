MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. Welcome to the Bâloise Group Annual Results
2016 Analysts Conference Call. I'm Celina, the Chorus Call operator. I would like to remind
you that all participants will be in listen-only mode, and the conference is being recorded.
After the presentation, there will be a Q&A session. The conference must not be recorded
for publication or broadcast.
At this time, it's my pleasure to hand over to Mr. Marc Kaiser, Head of Corporate
Communications and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.

Marc Kaiser

{BIO 15056036 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. Welcome from our side. Thank you for joining us for this
year's full year results 2016 call. And I would now like to hand over to Gert De Winter.

Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Thank you, Marc. Maybe quickly the highlights of 2016, and then a short look forward into
2017. 2016 was another very good year for Bâloise Group and we are very satisﬁed with
the results. We increased the proﬁt by almost 5%, up to CHF 535 million. We see very
good growth in the target segments we are aiming at, meaning in non-life 3%, in the unitPage 1 of 15

linked business over 5%. The already explained combined ratio has been brought down
further by 1.1% points to 92.2%, and that is despite the reserves strengthening in Germany
in half year of 2016.
In the life business, we're clearly adapting the business mix away from guarantees and
into more capital-eﬃcient growth products, and we are underwriting selectively. And you
see the impact structurally on the new business margin and on the interest margin that we
gain out of the life business. And despite the low interest environment or even negative
interest environment, our asset management business continues to provide a solid, very
interesting source of proﬁt.
The balance sheet is very strong, even stronger after reserving an additional over CHF
300 million in the life business. And given these excellent results, the proposal to the
board will be to increase the dividend up to CHF 5.20 per share. This means that we start
2017 and our new Simply Safe strategy with a very, very strong results, with also very
ambitious goals, 1 million additional clients, one of the best employers and CHF 2 billion
cash into the holding for investments in growth and to continue our attractive shareholder
policy.

Bloomberg Transcript

Of course, we're only started, but you can always (03:16) see the signals on the way with
investments in new products, partnerships with ﬁntechs, the launch of a mobile insurer in
Germany, the ﬁrst connected car product launched this week in Luxembourg. So, Simply
Safe is already on its way.
That would be it, I would be very willing to open up for questions. With me are Martin
Wenk, our CIO; and German Egloﬀ, our CFO. So, we will be trying to deal with your
diﬃcult questions.

Q&A
Operator
We will now begin the question-and-answer session The ﬁrst question is from Mr. Peter
Eliot from Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Three questions if I may. The ﬁrst one was on the reserve releases, I
mean you – obviously this very good (04:29) ﬁrst half of the year and you can see that that
could continue in the second half. Just looking forward, I'm just wondering to what extent
we can expect that to continue. And I'm just wondering if there's any guidance or any
comments you can make there on what we might expect for the future.
The second thing was, just on slide 12 actually, you – under loss ratio, there's an
adjustment for impending losses which has had sort of a 1 percentage point swing across
the year. So I was wondering if you could just explain what's happening there.

And then the third question was on the life. I guess looking at slide 19, if you sort of sum
up the policyholder participation and reserve strengthening, you get sort of CHF 402
million which is quite a lot more than the savings results. I mean I understand that it's in
shareholders' interest to put as much into reserves as possible. There's this (05:38) sort of
asymmetric risk play there. But I guess, I was just surprised at the extent of it and that
essentially, it kind of looks like people that sort of (05:50) put more into reserves or
(05:51) policyholder than you have in the savings (05:54) result. And I'm just wondering if
you could give us your thoughts on the dynamics there. Thank you very much.

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Let me take out the ﬁrst of the questions, I'll hand over to German afterwards, on the more
technical one. In terms of the reserve release, I assume you're pointing at the non-life
reserve release.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Yes, (06:15)

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So if you look at last year, the proﬁt generated by the reserves release were less and that
was actually because of old claims in Germany. If you look at 2016, we are back, I would
say, to what would be a historical average of around 2% to 3% of reserve release. So it's
rather a normalized situation again in 2016 if you compare it to 2015. So, that would be
the guidance, 2% to 3% per year in terms of...

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Could I just maybe ask very quickly. I mean, obviously you had some signiﬁcant
strengthening in Germany this year, and if you back that out then the reserve releases I
think would be just over 4%. So, maybe that's just normal volatility and diﬀerent regions
contribute diﬀerently.

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Yeah. I would say so, that of course the German reserve strengthening was extraordinary.
But on the other hand, the portfolio in Switzerland is a lot bigger and there we have
certain volatilities as well. So I would say that, in general, it's still about the same as we –
what we said in the past.
About the impending losses, that relates to the health and accident business in
Switzerland where due to the development of the claims there, you have to reserve for
future losses. But in fact, that's just because of the current situation in the claims – what's
happening on the claims side. If you remember we are re-underwriting that portfolio. So,
that is just a regulatory rule and then that's why it's right to develop that from the order
reclaims ratio to see the quality of the portfolio. That's just an accounting position, if you
like.

FINAL

And then for the EBIT on life, I mean there the most of the reserve strengthening is
actually fueled by the thing what we're doing on the local GAAP closings, and there we
are just re-reserving the guarantee rates. And just imagine, if interest rates are staying
where they are currently, then the average guarantee rate or the average liability still stays
relatively high, because there is still an ongoing gap between the returns that you get and
the liabilities that you have. So therefore, it's wise to re-reserve that liability.
In Germany, you have this ZZR, so there it's legally ruled. In Switzerland, we haven't that
(09:38) at the moment, but of course the regulator is discussing it as well. So, we are
actually doing it anyway what we think is sensible as well to avoid to get a regulatory rule
for that. So, we think it's certainly sensible, maybe you could say even a bit conservative
target. But on the other hand, if you distribute it to the shareholders that would be wrong
as well because you can actually only decide whether you do it now or later, but you have
to do it anyway. And ultimately, I mean if interest rates are – even if they are rising
currently, you still have to re-reserve the technical interest rate because the average is still
going down.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks a lot.

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So actually, I mean if the interest rate situation is changing a lot, you can free up the
capital a bit.

Operator
The second question comes from Mr. Farquhar Murray from Autonomous. Please go
ahead.

Q - Farquhar C. Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Good morning, gentlemen. Just two questions if I may. Firstly, the life EBIT in the second
half is a very strong CHF 181 million. I think if there is some mortality beneﬁt in there then it
would be great, perhaps if you could maybe quantify that for us, even so it looks to be
running probably a bit ahead of the guided rate of about CHF 200 million per annum. So
I just wondered if you could give us an update on that guidance on the life EBIT, and in
particular, perhaps why it might be looking like its running a bit better?
And then secondly, on the non-life side, you're indicating that – adjusting for the German
reserve strengthening, the combined ratio at the group level would have been about
90.3%. Is that a realistic expectation for the years ahead, because I would have thought
maybe there was a bit of favorable weather in 2016, but will be interested to get your
thoughts? Thanks.

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. I (11:57) for the ﬁrst one. It's always diﬃcult to predict the life EBIT, but I still think
that CHF 200 million is quite a fair guess and I would stay to that. But if you say, well, is it
improving in the long term, just the question we had before? Of course, if your technical
liabilities are coming down then that's long-term possibility to get more proﬁt out the way.
However, currently, I would more or less stick to those CHF 200 million.
What you have to consider is that we are still quite sensitive on what capital markets are
doing, just that in the last phase of the year, because for example, derivatives are going
through P&L there. And that's just – if you have interest rate derivatives, that 1 or 2 basis
points may make a diﬀerence of a double-digit million amount. So therefore, it can
happen that you are a bit above. But in general, I would say that CHF 200 million is a fair
expectation nevertheless.

Q - Farquhar C. Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Just one point to detail, I mean what was the mortality release in the second half by the
way?

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

(13:23)

Q - Farquhar C. Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah, yeah.

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Now, I have to look – come back to that later. Maybe I have the (13:34) combined ratio.
There, to expect a 90-ish combined ratio is maybe a bit too optimistic. You just have to
consider. We had slots in Belgium and Germany, but we had almost no elementary losses
in Switzerland. And of course, if you have a nice big hailstorm in Switzerland, that changes
the situation immediately. So therefore, in a very good and lucky year, the 90s might be
realistic. But I think, as an expectation, it will be too optimistic.

Q - Farquhar C. Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Okay. (14:23)

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

And I just gave information (14:26) the release of the claims reserve adjustments. So from
the risk result, would be about the same as in previous year in general. So, there was a
one-oﬀ in it.

Q - Farquhar C. Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks.

FINAL

The next question comes from Mr. Stefan Schürmann from Bank Vontobel. Please go
ahead.

Q - Stefan Schürmann
Yes, hello. I have three questions, please. The ﬁrst one on the cash to the holding, just
maybe can you elaborate how much cash you paid up to the holding in 2016. I'm not
quite sure about that amount, I think it was CHF 275 million in 2015. And now, on the base
of where your target is for CHF 2 billion going forward.
Then the second question is basically on the reserve additions in life. Can you maybe give
some more granularity on where that happened? Is that only Switzerland, is it also
Germany, and then maybe also individual and group life?
And the third one, just on the run-oﬀ transaction in Germany, where you basically closed
now this year (15:36). Can you conﬁrm again that there will be basically a neutral impact
on P&L, and also maybe give a hint on how much holding capital can free up with that?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Okay. I'm starting. Cash to the holding, you see the participation earnings, which are CHF
250-ish million and that includes the dividends which are already paid and the accrued
dividends. However, the whole cash statement is not done yet because that's now the
starting point, but of course we have interest rates as well for example, and there are
other look-through eﬀects that are ﬂowing through the holding.
And of course, we are currently about to – let's say, to improve those ﬂows up to now until
the Investor Day. The cash ﬂow is not overall targeted to the holding. We had all the cash
proﬁts within the group and that will be re-managed. So currently, the ﬁgure is not
disclosed and it's probably then next year when we have a starting point to see and we
have to deﬁne what includes those cash ﬂows at all.
Then the reserve for life, strengthening, it's mainly – the big chunk is Switzerland and its
group life and individual life, and it's the ZZR in Germany. What we haven't had this year,
but last year is the so-called, knipperend licht (17:34) reserve in Belgium because we got
an extension there.
The Belgium regulator said that people that are above a certain Solvency II ratio get an
exemption from providing this knipperend licht (17:51) reserve. However, we have in
Belgium, and you know in Belgium, there is – is the only company that we have where in
the same legal entity, we have life and non-life business. And Belgium has this thing
called funds for future appropriations. And there that is a certain buﬀer for future reserve
strengthenings, for example. And they have put some millions in there to be prepared if,
let's say, they're changing their politics again. Because last year in Belgium, that was not
Page 6 of 15

Company Ticker: BALN SW Equity
Date: 2017-03-23

because their (18:33) Solvency II ratio was too low, just nobody got an exemption there.
So, they are changing their politics by the year sometimes.

FINAL

And then the third one was the sell-oﬀ of the portfolio in Germany. There is some SST
capital that will be free but that's not really relevant for the group. In general, there will be
certain deconsolidation loss, which is in the area of between CHF 10 million and CHF 20
million.

Q - Stefan Schürmann
Okay. Yes. Thank you.

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Thank you.

Operator
The next question is from Mr. Ralph Hebgen from KBW. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Yeah. Hi. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Two things relating to the life result. If
you look at slide 19, the proﬁt by source, what I missed on the slide is perhaps a comment
on the fee result. Is there a reason that you don't split that out separately or perhaps it's
not material enough? Anything on your thinking on what might constitute a fee result
would be welcome?
And second, staying on the slide, the risk result has increased very forcibly, and I was
wondering whether you could tell us a little bit about the underlying drivers there and
indeed also whether you see the acceleration as sustainable or the CHF 296 million here
as a new baseline going forward? Thank you.

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

First, for the fee result, ﬁrstly that's distributed through the three drivers, so that is a bit
diﬃcult to separate that. That's one point. And the other point is that we have fee
business as well, which is in the banking segment from the asset management side, and
which is actually originated from the life business. So if the – both asset management is
managing funds, which are used for unit liked policies, part of the fee result is in the
banking segment and part of it is in the life segment. So, therefore, that's not an easy one
to clear that up.
What you're probably interested in is to know what this really more services business is
creating in terms of fees. And I would not guide the (21:43) but we can for the future. We
can totally discuss whether we would like to disclose that or not. And this is the ﬁrst one,
and the second one about the risk result. There is a one-oﬀ included because there was a
release of claims reserves in that just – like I just mentioned before.

FINAL

So I think that the CHF 240 million from 2015 is probably a better proxy than the CHF 296
million. What's more is that currently in Switzerland, especially in the second ﬁeld of
business, we have quite a tough political discussion, how big the risk results might be
there. And so the tariﬀs are (22:42) going down a bit. So it shouldn't be – even though, of
course, mortality gains are a natural hedge to the old age risk, but politics are not
considering that as appropriate way of thinking. So, therefore, I think CHF 240 million is
probably the better – a better proxy for the future.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Okay. That's extremely helpful. Thank you. Just as a – and perhaps a point on my wish list.
I'm so, almost skeptical or hesitant to say it but analysts always want more stuﬀ. But do
you think it might be possible for you to analyze the risk result in future by reference to
expense ratios and loss ratios as some other companies have done So, that might give us
some additional...

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Since I'm certainly not doing it myself, and I'm not responsible for it in the future. I gladly
take it and pass it over to my colleagues, so they can do with it whatever they like then.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Okay, that's excellent. Thank you very much indeed.

We have a follow-up question from Mr. Farquhar Murray. Please go ahead.

Q - Farquhar C. Murray

{BIO 15345435 <GO>}

Good morning, gentleman. Just I have one brief follow-up actually. I understand you're
not giving any the SST position as formal number, but I just wondered if you could maybe
give us a sense of how the SST ratio has developed there – through the year-to-date so far
in particular given some of the kind of the sovereign spread widening (24:32) and
perhaps you could just give us bit of a color around how sensitive you would be to
sovereign spreads more generally? Thanks.

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Yes, I can give you that, the color would be green actually.

It's – still be a bad debt, and the sensitivity is that we have given in the – at the Investors
Day, they still hold to. What I can tell you is that, it seems and that the ratio is getting a bit
less nervous than, than it has to be in the past. However, whether that's from the Capital
Markets, or because the model is getting more stable, that's another question. But, still I
mean the key questions around SST is, is there a reason to bother around the dividend?
No, obviously not, otherwise we wouldn't increase it. And is there a reason to bother
around the capital? Neither that, otherwise we wouldn't increase the dividend.

The next question comes from Mr. René Locher from MainFirst. Please go ahead.

Q - René Locher
Yes. Hello, everybody. Just a few follow-up questions. So, ﬁrst of all I would like to start
with slide 36, there is this EBIT Matrix. And I was wondering if it is fair to assume that nonlife Germany, which was minus CHF 53 million in 2016, if you target now a combined ratio
of roughly 100% in Germany, is it fair to assume that here – that we should have at least a
breakeven EBIT in German non-life? That's the ﬁrst question.
And, the second one is just curious at the very beginning, (26:56) I think that's slide 5,
when I look at banking and asset management, interesting here I think that the assets
under management to third party, you're at CHF 4.9 billion. And I mean, correct me when
I'm wrong but I think you mentioned at the Investor's Day, that you target CHF 5 billion in
third party asset, just as a clariﬁcation?
And then – yeah again one follow-up on cash remittance. When I am looking at in the
Annual Report on page 268, so that's the income statement of the Bâloise Holding. They
are looking at the total income, there are three income streams and yeah it looks very
volatile from 2015 to 2016. I was just wondering what is the dividend income in – you have
in 2016?

Page 9 of 15

Date: 2017-03-23

FINAL

And then my last question, here again on cash remittance, and I am wondering – as far as I
understood, you go for this CHF 2 billion, ﬁve years proﬁt, CHF 400 million per annum, if I
did simple 50 million shares, that that's roughly CHF 8 per share, and this I understood.
You're also ﬁnancing, like for example, ﬁntech, brochure (28:34) and so on and so on. And
then as an example, the mobile insurer Friday you launched in Germany, was this ﬁnanced
by the cash or was it ﬁnanced by policyholder money? Thank you very much.

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Let me try to respond to some of the questions, but I'll certainly handover to the more
technical questions in there to Martin Wenk and German Egloﬀ. First on the combined
ratio in Germany, as we have said last year too, we target as of 2017, a combined ratio
which is below 100% in Germany. It's clear that the German market is diﬀerent, is even
more competitive, is fragmented. So we don't expect it to become – to land in the range
of 90% to 95%, but rather in the range of 96% to 98% in Germany. The asset
management, and Martin will certainly allude to that, what you see on page 5 is the
current third-party assets under management, with the project objective that we have set
and stated forward. So we are aiming for an additional CHF 5 billion...

Q - René Locher
Oh, I see.

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

...assets under management. I'll leave the cash remittance and so forth to German, and
maybe Martin can also say something additionally on the third-party project.

A - Martin Wenk

{BIO 4193573 <GO>}

Yeah. Hi, René. This is Martin. I mean Gert already said this explanation, it's really so that
we want to double...

Q - René Locher
Okay.

A - Martin Wenk

{BIO 4193573 <GO>}

...our third-party business. So it's by coincidence a similar ﬁgure.

Q - René Locher
Okay. Thank you.

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

For the proﬁt or the dividend or the proﬁt of the subsidiaries, the ﬁgure is actually far less
volatile than it looks between 2015 and 2016. The reason that 2015 was so high was that
the valuation of the subsidiaries was reevaluated and Luxembourg was – the value was
increased and Liechtenstein re-upped (31:04) value was decreased. So therefore, there
Page 10 of 15



Company Name: Baloise Holding AG
Company Ticker: BALN SW Equity
Date: 2017-03-23

was a special eﬀect there. In fact, the dividend was CHF 254 million in 2015 and in 2016,
CHF 256 million, so it's more or less quite stable.

Q - René Locher

FINAL

Okay. Thank you.

Operator
Gentlemen that was the last question. Sorry, we have a last set on (31:30) registration from
Mr. Michael Huttner from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.

Q - Michael Igor Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Thank you. And I'm sure you've been asked the same question. But I wasn't listening all
the time and maybe the answer – I did not understand the answer. Just getting back to
the life, the CHF 250 million-odd proﬁt and after CHF 317 million of reserving. If I think of
the underlying, should I add back the CHF 300 million reserving or – I mean, clearly, the
reserving is a negative. But how much does it – what would be the underlying if interest
rates were a little bit benign. I mean, maybe not stable, but (32:12).

Bloomberg Transcript

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

What I said there is that the CHF 200 million underlying is probably still quite a good
guidance, because we have the re-reserving of the technical interest rate is – has actually
diﬀerent possibilities. Interest rates are rising immediately. But still the technical
guarantees are too high for a while, and if they stay where they are, you have to
continuously re-reserve. And if they in fold after re-reserve until you're on nil (32:45) I
guess.
So therefore – as a current guidance to CHF 200 million for the next, let's say, 18 month or
so, is probably not a bad proxy. But you're right (33:02) the CHF 300 million, if the
situation would change dramatically, the CHF 300 million or whatever we did in
additional reserving will become free again then it of course (33:19) then adds to the EBIT
ﬁgure in the future.

A - Martin Wenk

{BIO 4193573 <GO>}

Maybe I can add one more aspect to that because I think it's important. Some of those of
realizing of gains already happens by managing the assets. And as you know, we have this
negative rates on the short end of the curve, and if we sell bonds there, we just realize –
we realize capital gains, but we also lose current income by the high coupons. So we have
to put something into reserves for that, that we need in the future to have the income that
we lose in the reserves. So some of the reserves are already consumed for that, and you
cannot just add that to or – to the proﬁt that we have made, this CHF 300 million. So this is
– it's a delicate balance that we do and some of it is just initiated basically by asset
management.

Understand. And just as a follow-on, you said 18 months kind of CHF 200 million, kind of
feel for what it could look like. Does the 18 months – is that linked to the likely referendum,
I know, have you done with some of the conversion rates?

No, no, no, that's a bond that was just – I just didn't want to say ﬁve years, and I didn't
want to say one years for banking month, but...

Q - Michael Igor Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Okay.

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

So that's at 20 months as well.

Q - Michael Igor Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Okay, okay.

A - German Egloﬀ

It was an educated guess, just.

Okay.

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

...because within, I don't expect a dramatic change in the interest rates for the next, let's
say 12 months, so it's early as 18 months if you see a reaction in the ﬁgures.

Q - Michael Igor Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

I understand. That makes sense. That's it. Thank you very much.

We have a question from Mr. Daniel Bischof from Baader-Helvea. Please go ahead.

Q - Daniel Bischof

{BIO 17407166 <GO>}

Yeah, good morning, a very quick one on page 18. When you reported a signiﬁcant
improvement in the life new business margin here, the more selective underwriting had a
positive impact, but I think you also mentioned there was a change in the calculation

method. Could you explain what happened there and what the underlying improvement
was?

FINAL

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Yes. We had that – but it was just some model adjustments, up to now we were maybe too
conservative in building in the change in the – or the management rules concerning the
policyholder dividend. And the environment was there a bit more aggressive in the past
already and we just did that as well now. And now about the impact, I wouldn't know
exactly, probably half of it is portfolio mix and half of it is model (36:29) change (36:29).

Q - Daniel Bischof

{BIO 17407166 <GO>}

All right. Thank you.

We have another follow-up question from Mr. René Locher. Please go ahead.

Q - René Locher

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes, me again. You just sort of answered one of my questions that was some on these
investment in insurtech, like for example, mobility in Germany. And again just to
understand, I mean, I've got a lot of detail from IR department as far as I understood so
far, I think you've invested CHF 20 million. You intend to invest CHF 50 million, but I am
wondering if this money – is this cash you optioned (37:14) to the holding or is this money
from policyholders account? Thank you.

A - German Egloﬀ

{BIO 4782831 <GO>}

Yes. We are doing both. So, on Friday, so tomorrow, so next Friday the company, and
that's a subsidiary. So, that's still money, company money. And – but we have this fund
that we are setting up together with Anthemis, we mentioned that in the Investors Day,
and that's an investment which is a (38:00). So that's policyholder money or reserves, let's
put it that way.

Q - René Locher
Okay. Okay. So that helps.

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

All of these things, non-life reserves. You don't know and you can't decide whether its
policyholder or shareholder.

A - Martin Wenk

{BIO 4193573 <GO>}

I can just add to that, to that fact that (38:17) is investments we do in insurtech with
Anthemis, it's a portfolio that is supposedly is to reach CHF 50 million. And we have CHF
600 million in private equity investments already. So basically, all we do is we take 10% of
our private equity investment and allocate it in an industry that should lead to some

insights for own industry, that's all. But it has the same, let's say the same guidance, the
same expectations behind it as if we would do another private equity investment.

FINAL

Q - René Locher
No. No. Fully understood. I mean you know, where I'm coming from is, I guess oﬀered
(38:56) already at the Investors Day when you are going for CHF 2 billion in cash, then I
guess you should not expect that all that money is going back to shareholder. Otherwise, I
would end up at roughly CHF 8 per share, right, so that's why I am asking. Thanks you
very much.

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

I think René, just to conclude on that and I think at the Investors Day and we'll repeat that
the CHF 2 billion cash into the holdings serves two purposes. One is certainly to continue
the attractive shareholder policy, that's one. The second one, however being the
investments in new growth, in new areas of growth, like mobile insurance, like
digitalization and other things. So it's the combination of two. And it's not – as we look at
those investments and those growth opportunities on a case-by-case basis, you can't tell
that much of the CHF 2 billion goes into growth and that much of the CHF 2 billion goes
to the shareholder. So that's the case-by-case judgment call, depending on the
opportunity and the likelihood of generating growth and proﬁt.

Q - René Locher
