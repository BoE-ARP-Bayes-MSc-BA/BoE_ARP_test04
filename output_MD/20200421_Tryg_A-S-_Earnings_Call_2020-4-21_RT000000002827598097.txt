{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. This is Gianandrea Roberti, I'm Head of Investor Relations at
Tryg. We published our Q1 results earlier this morning. And I have here with me Morten
Hubbe, Group CEO; and Barbara Plucnar Jensen, Group CFO, to present the ﬁgures.
Over to you, Morten.

Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Thank you, Gian, and good morning from me as well. We start on Slide 3 where we
reported technical result of DKK672 million, up some 7% versus ﬁrst quarter last year,
including also DKK40 million net negative claim from the outbreak of corona. We will get
back to this in further detail, but corona has resulted in net travel claims of DKK115 million
for the quarter and DKK255 million before reinsurance oﬀset by lower frequencies in
diﬀerent lines of businesses towards the end of March of in total DKK75 million for the
quarter. In general, the business continues to improve well. We see a strong top line
development. We see a continued improvement in the underlying claims ratio and we'll
see the Alka synergies coming in as planned.

FINAL

Clearly investment income was challenging for the quarter minus DKK980 million, which
was a period of unprecedented turbulence in capital markets, almost all asset classes fell,
and all leading equity indices were down more than 20% and there was really no place to
hide. Most of this was already disclosed in our announcement on March 27, and actually
this situation has improved somewhat in the last days of March.
We also announced that in 2020 we will move to a full-year dividend decision as opposed
to quarterly following the unprecedented events in Q1 and the regulatory conversations
within entire insurance sector. The solvency ratio was 159 at the end of Q1, but very
positively on April 20, we received the FSA approval for our revised internal model, which
will lowers the SCR by approximately DKK400 million, meaning that the pro forma
solvency ratio is a 174%.

On Slide 4, on customer development. We're very satisﬁed to see continued
improvement in our customer targets. We know that there's a strong link between
customer loyalty and retention and that plays a large role to our expense ratio in our
bottom line. We see that our improvement in TNPS goes from 67 to 69, which is actually
all time high customer satisfaction. The improvement comes particularly from the claims
area, but also from private Denmark and private Norway. And you'll see later that our
customer satisfaction in the corona period has been particularly strong.
Also you see a further improvement in the number of products per customer increasing
from 3.8% to 3.9% and approaching the full-year target of 4.0%. Also positive to notice
that, the Danish non-customers knowledge of the membership bonus continues to
improve, this quarter, the awareness was 30% against 20% the year before, but there's
still a very signiﬁcant potential for the non-customers of Tryg to become aware of the
attraction of our bonus model.
On Slide 5, we elaborate on the technical result. As mentioned, it is DKK672 million for the
quarter an improvement of DKK46 million even including a net negative impact of corona
of some DKK40 million. Private had a somewhat lower result than Q1 the year before,
driven by a net impact of corona, which is highest for the private area and also lower
runoﬀ level.
We are happy to see that the corporate business improves as a combination of improved
underlying development, but also a lower level of large claims and higher level of runoﬀ.
Commercial business saw a signiﬁcant improvement, which however can be subscribed
to a much lower level of large claims compared to same period previous year, but we also
saw an improvement due to price initiatives particularly for the larger commercial
customers in Norway.
On Slide 6, I'll comment a bit on the overall drivers of corona, and Barbara will go into
more detail on that. But clearly, there is a strong impact in Q1 also in Tryg. But we see in
Tryg a very robust business model even in an extraordinary situation like this. We see
particularly that travel claims has been challenging, we have seen more than 45,000
consumer contacts relating to corona and by now more than 30,000 corona related travel

FINAL

claims. And we were very pleased to see that our customer satisfaction has actually
improved in both Denmark and Norway during this period.
I'm particularly pleased to see that Tryg in a situation like this has been able to help our
customers in a professional way, particularly since more than 4,000 employees have been
working from home, with all of the technical and communicational diﬃculty associated
with that. As I mentioned, travel insurance is clearly the area where we've seen the most
claims and you can see that from the illustration of this slide, particularly in the middle of
March.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the other hand, corona situation has resulted in less activity in society, and therefore
reduce the number of normal claims, so to speak, in areas such as motor, contents, health
and accident. But be aware that between the countries there is a big diﬀerence on timing
and on the degree of lockdown. In the Nordic countries lockdown was eﬀectively from
13th of March, in some countries that was sooner and later. And be aware that in countries
like, Italy and Spain, you see very hard lockdown, where people are not allowed to leave
their houses that is not the case in the Nordics where people can actually leave their
houses to do what they want, but generally try to work from home. But as I said, Barbara
will elaborate on the numbers and impacts.
On Slide 4, we give an update on the Alka synergies, I think it is very positive to see that
the synergies from Alka continues to be delivered according to plan. For Q1 it was DKK43
million. And I'd like to highlight that we've now started using independent private agents
in Alka for cross-selling to the one product customers. This concept has worked very well
in private Denmark in Tryg. And it works extremely well, when combined with Alka's
online sales model, which is very eﬃcient to attract one product customers in an eﬃcient
way.
On Slide 8, we elaborate on shareholders, and as you know, we published on the 27th of
March, a stock exchange announcement explaining that we would move to full year
dividend decision for 2020, as opposed to the usual quarterly, following the extreme
capital market development in Q1, and the increased global uncertainty. Also the local
FSAs have been quite clear in their guidance to the insurance sector in general on being
cautious on dividends. This does not change at all our aim to deliver a nominal stable
increasing dividend, and it does not change at all Tryg's overall dividend policy.
On Slide 10, we elaborate on premium development. The growth was very strong at 8.9%.
But we're particularly pleased to see that private lines as the most proﬁtable area in Tryg
also has a very strong growth of 10.4% in the quarter. It is helped by the strong premium
development last year and therefore much bigger portfolio at the beginning of 2020
compared to 2019. Also we see a strong development in Denmark, with cross-selling and
sales through our strong partner agreements with FDM, Danske Bank, but also from our
new and independent sales agents.
Commercial has a growth of 6.8%, which is somewhat higher level than the last quarters,
especially due to price increases for large commercial customers in Norway. Now
corporate showed a growth of 4.9%, it was impacted by price hikes in Norway, which also

FINAL

reduced the Norwegian corporate portfolio, while in Denmark, the Danish corporate
portfolio was positively impacted due to the high acceptance of price increases of around
10%.
Sweden showed a relatively high growth of 4.9% driven primarily by price initiatives in
motor to improve proﬁtability. In general, we haven't seen much impact on the top-line
from corona yet, but going forward, we would expect to see some impact on the
premium levels going forward particularly in the corporate and commercial segment
following the drop in the economic growth in society.
On Slide 11, we comment on price developments in the business and clearly adjusting
prices in accordance with claim inﬂation is extremely important and a key focus area
which we monitor very closely. Proﬁtability improvement is always a combination of claims
initiatives and price adjustments. And be aware that when we have a relatively high
growth as we saw in '19 and also in '20, we will have a slightly negative impact on the
average price level as some products and channels use introductory discounts.
On Slide 12, we elaborate on the customer retention rates. Clearly, customer focus is
extremely important for Tryg and customers' views are easily monitored through the
retention rates. We're very pleased to see stable and improved retention rates in Q1 at a
very high level, and we believe that our current development of digital solutions will make
it even more convenient to be a customer in Tryg and therefore support the retention
rates going forward.

And, over to you Barbara.

Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Thank you very much Morten. I will now go through the details of our claims and
expenses, in particular providing a bit more insight on the impact of COVID-19. So please
turn to Slide number 14. In this chart, we look at the underlying claims ratio without the
impact of claims related to COVID-19. The group underlying claims ratio improved by 50
basis points and our private segment by 40. Price adjustments and the claims excellence
program including claims synergies related to Alka are the main drivers behind the
improvement, but also a re-balancing of the portfolio towards more private business
supports the overall improvement for the group.
Compared to previous quarters, the high growth in the private business had a slightly less
positive impact on the underlying claims ratio, as new customers in general will have a
slightly higher claims ratio compared to old customers. However, on group level we see
improvement in the corporate segment oﬀset some of this impact, due to price increases
and re-selection. Overall, it's expected that the group's underlying claims ratio will
continue on a similar trajectory.
On Slide 15, we will go through the negatives on the claims perspective from the COVID19 impact. Here we will show you the negative impact where we have highlighted some of
the business lines that have actually reported claims in Q1 already that will be the travel

insurance that Morten also spoke about, while the others are more to be considered as
risk areas going forward. In the Nordics, Denmark, and Norway have been locked down
since mid-March, which for Q1 has triggered travel insurance claims of gross DKK255
million, net DKK115 million post reinsurance.
Looking at the potential negatives, we highlight Tryg Garanti, business interruption and
group life. We have not seen much of an impact in Q1, but potentially they will have some
degree of impact in the coming quarters depending on how the pandemic and economic
activity will develop from here. It's important to note that, we have pretty good protection
with our reinsurance program. And we try to disclose as much as possible, but obviously
there are competitive considerations in selected situations.

Bloomberg Transcript

Please turn to Slide 16. On balance, we will see that lower economic activity is likely to
drive lower claims frequencies in select lines of business. This is exactly what we have
experienced since mid-March following the lockdown as mentioned in Denmark and
Norway in particular. Compared to most European countries we want to point out that the
lockdown in Denmark and Norway has been somewhat less restrictive, and while being
focused to enforce social distancing et cetera there has been no hard restrictions on the
oral [ph] limitations on movement as such. Furthermore, the lockdown has been put in
place earlier, but more staged than seen in most other European countries. Hence the
impact on the frequencies has been more gradual, meaning that the impact has been
biggest in week three, as opposed to week two, which again was bigger than in the ﬁrst
week of the lockdown.
Sweden has had a somewhat diﬀerent approach as the authorities have never called for a
real lockdown. However, as you know our Swedish business is relatively small in a group
context. The three areas, where we have seen some impact in Q1, with frequencies down
by 15% to 20 % in March are motor claims with less cars on the roads, less accidents and
content claims as described here.
Now, as of last week, Denmark has started a gradual reopening. We see that
approximately 50% of the children are back in school, some businesses are reopening et
cetera, and Norway is following as of this week. More will gradually be open from here,
but it will have a rather long implementation, and therefore a gradual normalization of
claims frequencies is also expected.
On Slide 17, you see the traditional overview of our large claims, weather claims and
runoﬀ. In Q1, we had again a somewhat milder winter than the ordinary, so we had a
somewhat lower level of large and weather claims compared to Q1 '19 and in particular, as
mentioned the weather claims were well below normal. We did have an extraordinary
high number of ﬂooding and storm claims in select areas of the Nordics, but despite a
very high absolute number of claims, which was double compared to 2019 they were
relatively small in size. The discounting impact in the ﬁrst quarter of 2020 was much lower
than in the same period last year due to the lower interest rate level in general and in
particular in Norway. The runoﬀ result was slightly lower with 6.4%, compared to 7.1% in Q1
2019.

FINAL

Please turn to Slide 18. The expense ratio for Q1 '20 was 14.1% and in line with the target
for 2020 of around 14%. The balance continues to be more eﬃcient distribution, which to
a large degree in ﬁnance our IT investments. We have seen a slight increase in the
number of employees driven by more employees working with digitalization and IT
development in the business, as well as an increase in the claims handling.
In the following section, we will turn to our investment income and capital. So please turn
to Slide 20. You probably remember that we have previously looked at this slide, where
we split our investments in a free and a match portfolio to provide more detailed input.
The match portfolio is the material part of our investments with the purpose to match
Tryg's insurance liabilities, while the free portfolio is investing the capital of the company
on a risk-adjusted basis. Since year-end, the total investments are down approximately a
DKK2 billion, given the payment of the ordinary Q4 dividend, as well as the extraordinary
dividend and also given the investment results in Q1.

Bloomberg Transcript

On Page 21, you can see that this was indeed a quarter that will go down in history with
unprecedented turmoil in the ﬁnancial markets following the outbreak of COVID-19, and
obviously this had an impact on our investments. The total investment results ended with
a negative DKK980 million, slightly better than what we disclosed on March 27. We have a
low risk proﬁle on our free portfolio, but given the magnitude of the movements in the
capital markets, the free portfolio reported a return in the quarter of approximately 7%.
Equities had a negative return of approximately minus 20%, and more or less all asset
classes has had negative returns.
Unusually, the match portfolio also produced a negative result of approximately DKK200
million in the quarter, driven by the widening of Nordic covered bonds spreads, and
furthermore negative impact from the interest rate hike of the Danish Central Bank, which
was not fully oﬀset by a similar change of the discounting curve. Other ﬁnancial income
and expenses was broadly in line with expectations. Q2 to-date, we observed a reversal of
the capital markets and a positive development impacting our free portfolio of
approximately 1.5% as disclosed on tryg.com.
Please, turn to Slide 22. Here you can see that our solvency ratio was 159 at the end of the
quarter. Own funds were obviously, hit by the quarterly loss on investments and hence
our negative pre-tax result, while lower intangibles had a positive impact. However, due
to negative movement in currencies, our subordinated loans reported a lower amount in
DKK, so looking at the main movements, own funds were down by approximately
DKK600 million.
Please do remember that following the decision to move away from quarterly dividend
payments to a dividend decision at the end of 2020, there is no Q1 dividend payment and
hence no dividend accrual in the own funds. The solvency capital requirement was down
by approximately DKK300 million, primarily helped by a lower capital charge for market
risk on equities, but also by a currency movements given the smaller business in Norway
and Sweden, which imply a lower non-life capital charge.

FINAL

Finally, I would like to draw your attention to a relevant subsequent event that Morten
brieﬂy mentioned. Yesterday, the Danish FSA approved our revised partial internal model.
The key elements of the new model are the inclusion of the Swedish business, which gives
us more geographical diversiﬁcation and further improvements to the model. This has led
to a lower marginal capital requirement for the non-life insurance risks. Following the
approval, the pro forma SCR is approximately DKK400 million lower and the overall
solvency ratio is approximately 174%.
Please turn to Page 23. This slide provides more detail on the capital and solvency ratio
development and there's not much new compared to previous quarters. The point of
interest is that, Tier 2 and Tier 1 capacity can vary from quarter-to-quarter. And in this
quarter the Tier 2 capacity is inﬂuenced by the lower SCR and the Tier 1 capacity by the
level of core equity Tier 1, which is amongst other things impacted by the fact that the Q1
dividend is not being paid.

Bloomberg Transcript

Generally speaking, leaving aside a somewhat small quarterly dividend, the capacity for
both Tier 2 and Tier 1 has been fully utilized. As we have decided to move our dividend
decisions to year-end, it's also worth for this year it's also worth highlighting that the
solvency ratio at Q2 and Q3 under normal business and capital market developments is
likely to increase.
On Slide 24, you can see the solvency ratio sensitivities and this is a picture that you have
seen before, so not much has changed as per Q4. However, given the extreme market
volatility experienced in Q1 we are for the ﬁrst time also including the sensitivity to a plus
minus 30% movement in equities, which will have a stronger impact on the solvency ratio
as the so-called equity dampener will protect a somewhat from movements up to 20%,
but not thereafter. This is a standard characteristic in the Solvency II regulation hence not
Tryg speciﬁc, but it's worthwhile mentioning here.
This concludes the presentation on our investment result and capital and I would like to
hand over to Morten for an update on our targets for 2020.

Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Thank you, Barbara. And ﬁnally on Slide 25, we repeat our 2020 target of a technical
result of DKK3.3 billion, a combined ratio at or below 86, an expense ratio of around 14.
And then due to the very high loss on investment portfolio in Q1 and the very uncertain
capital markets outlook, as we published the 27th of March, we abandoned the target of
the ROE after-tax at or above 21% for the year 2020. Perhaps it's worthwhile to add that
Tryg has reported an average after-tax ROE of 23% in the last ﬁve years. Towards the end
of 2020, we will host a new Capital Markets Day, launching a new strategy and setting
new ﬁnancial targets.
And then we ﬁnish with our favorite quotes by John D. Rockefeller, on Slide 26. Our
investment case is completely unchanged, even if we had to adapt with the move to a fullyear dividend decision for the year 2020.

Questions And Answers

FINAL

Operator
(Question And Answer)
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our ﬁrst question comes from the line of Asbjorn Mork
from Danske Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

Yes, good morning. Couple of questions from my side. First on the travel claims for Q1,
and then leading into to Q2. I guess Q1 number does include some Easter eﬀect, and I
guess some claims that would I guess calendar-wise be Q2 claims; is that correctly
understood? And if that is correctly understood, could you sort of give us a date? Does
the claims include until the initial is close of Denmark from the Prime Minister? How long
is that? And then maybe a top up on that one, if Denmark were to remain fully closed in
Q2 and Norway for that matter as well, how would you have travel claims? Do you see
them in Q2 versus Q1 in the current situation? Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

I think -- hi, Asbjorn; very relevant question. I can conﬁrm that, yes, the Q1 numbers
include the Easter period as that was already known when we were looking at the Q1
results. But I think it's fair to say that when looking forward, we don't know what's really
going to happen. It all comes down to what is the guidance given by the government in
the various countries. And that may have an impact, of course, in terms of travel patterns
going forward.
We don't disclose at this point of time what our forecasted impact will be as it relies on a
broad number of expectations. But it's fair to say that comparing the ﬁrst period, so late
March and Easter that related to a number of travels that we have already known and that
customers have booked them, whereas what we're looking into going forward is very
much a question of how much have people already booked or how much are they
looking or planning to book, depending on how the pandemic actually develops in the
coming weeks and months.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I might add that there's a large dependency on the travel advisories from the foreign
ministries of the Nordic countries. Because, if it is just a continuation of the current ban of
traveling in the Nordics and outside the Nordics, then it will all relate back to the initial
date of stopping all travel, which then means that all of the travel claims in Q2 would be
the same reinsurance date as the initial claims. Whereas if, for instance, there is an
opening for claims for a period, and then a subsequent close down again, then it's a new
period of reinsurance.

Page 8 of 29



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2020-04-21

So therefore, the net ﬁgure will to a large extent be dependent upon whether it's a
continuation of the current lockdown or if there's an opening in between two lockdowns.
And the reality is, if there's a continuation, then reinsurance will cover most of it in Q2, and
if there's an opening, that's a new situation.

FINAL

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

So, make sure I understand, so the market, the travel remains close for the entire duration
of Q2. Your coverage, your reinsurance will be the same reinsurance that you already paid
there DKK100 million for in Q1. Was that correctly understood?

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

That is correctly understood.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

Okay. And then, if it's open again, you have another reinsurance program of a two-week
period, right?

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Yes.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

Okay. Fair enough. Let's say -- okay. All right. Thanks. Then on your new capital, two
questions there really, the new model approval, ﬁrst of all, I think, I remember you said
something about the 10% decline to your requirement, which would be more DKK500
million and now DKK400 million. So, just wondering whether that's just rounding. Second
of all, how should we look at the new solvency ratio in a historical context? I'm not trying
to get your answer on whether we should expect a quarterly dividend or anything like
that, just thinking that previously you've had very clear communication or, I mean payouts
when you've been at a 174% ratio. Should we -- do you see this at the same quality as 174%
would have been on the old setup?

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

I think, Asbjorn, very interesting points, but we don't see it in current conditions, as linked
one-to-one. As Morten highlighted very clearly, right now, we see turmoil and
uncertainties that we haven't seen before, which was the main driver for us deciding not
to pay the quarterly dividend in March. And I think, it is not over yet. We still don't know
what the rest of the year will contribute with.
So, I think it's too early just to say that because we have the approval, we are now ready to
payout dividends. Those are two, you can say, incidents that are not directly linked. But
obviously, we think it's positive that we got the model approval, because we see that now
Page 9 of 29



Company Name: Tryg A/S
Company Ticker: TRYG DC Equity
Date: 2020-04-21

we get the full picture of our business and also have the beneﬁts of the geographical
diversiﬁcation, which we didn't have before. So in general, we see it as a positive.

FINAL

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I think it's also very positive -- chance to see that it was a full approval. So there was no
adjustments from the FSA to the application we did. It was a full approval of all
calculations to the model adjustments that we put forward to the FSA. And I think that it's
a very positive acknowledgement of the way all our partial internal model works, and
we're pleased with 174% and then of course, we'd all like to see a period, where corona is
behind us and everyone understands all of the full implications of that, but we're pleased
with the model and the DKK400 million and the 174%.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

Yes, exactly, so my point being that once we go to year-end, if we're -- all this is behind us,
we should look at the 174% just like you've normally done in the past.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I think, we'll hopefully have that picture plus positive earnings for the remaining quarters
of the year. And then let's see towards the year end, if hopefully the world is in a clearer
place, but the reality is that there is still a period of uncertainty to be covered in corona
and that will probably take further quarters.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

All right. On the top line, a couple of questions there. First, on the private, is there any
corona impact here? Is there a lower churn in the market at the moment given the
situation? or is it just, I mean, would you have been able to grow the same level with -even without corona? And then on the reprising on the corporate, is this sort of an
industry standard? I mean, are we seeing your competitors follow suit or anybody more
aggressive in the corporate space at the moment?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Let me take the ﬁrst question; you can take the second, Barbara. If you look at the Private
lines growth in Q1, there is no corona impact in there. There is no signiﬁcant change to the
churn. So, it is a more of a reﬂection of the actual growth ability in the private lines. But be
aware that of course we got more than usual new partner agreements in private Norway,
particularly, last year. So, the growth in private Norway is slightly high compared to what
you would perceive as a longer term run rate, but no, there's no speciﬁc corona
extraordinary impacts in the growth in private lines in Q1.

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Yes. And on the corporate side, I can add that what probably surprised us on the positive
side in particular in Denmark was the acceptance rate. So, we deﬁnitely see that there is a
trend in the markets in terms of prices being increased, which is also the picture that we
have seen in Norway in the last three, four quarters as well. So, I think, it's the market that
is also following the trend that we are working on here.

FINAL

All right. And then a ﬁnal question from my side on the Alka facilities, you continue to
deliver more than expected and more than guided also in Q1. Are you -- should we expect
synergies to decline going forward? or are you just positively surprised by the synergies
you've been able to take out of the Alka company?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Our plan is we share your enthusiasm that the synergies in Alka are slightly higher than
planned. I think everything we've seen from the Alka portfolio is very strong both from a
standalone quality basis from the planned synergies, where we are slightly ahead of the
curve and also from the areas, where we can work together, Tryg and Alka. So, I think for
us, it's a slightly more positive situation than planned. But really we don't change our
outlook and we don't plan for reductions.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

All right. Just a very ﬁnal one actually. On the solvency, you show, the sensitivity to rise
towards a rising equities. It is very, very limited at the moment. Is that because the
dampener, you still have a negative drag from that going into Q2? Is that -- does that
leave limited upside short term if equities recover?

I think what you should bear in mind is the point of the 20% plus-minus, which is the area,
which the equity-dampener will impact. But if it's movements like we saw in particular in
the second half of March, where it was signiﬁcantly above the 20%, then the impact will
be bigger.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

But would you have a negative drag into Q2? I mean the dampener is three-months
average, right? So, I guess, it helps you in Q1, but it has a slight negative in Q2?

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

I think you could argue that we have had the beneﬁt of the dampener at the point, where
we really needed it so to speak with these levels of movements that we haven't
experienced in history before. So, from that point of view, you're right. We had the beneﬁt
when we needed it the most.

Q - Asbjorn Mork

{BIO 17028219 <GO>}

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Thank you, and good morning to you. Just one question on the investment portfolio split.
Now, of course, the things have improved a lot since late March, but I guess you had to
postpone your quarterly dividend maybe not only because the regulator wanted you to,
but also because solvency was getting somewhat impacted. Does this make you
reconsider your exposure towards equities and credits, and maybe also have it made you
consider using the VA spread on your discounting curve, which would have partly oﬀset
the negative asset movements in the quarter? That was the ﬁrst one.

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Hi, Jakob. To start with, I think we look at our investments in a long-term perspective, so
we don't jump to conclusions following a short time of extreme volatility. Obviously, we
have reviewed the investment strategies to see are there any things which we meaningful
should change or adjust. But I think our conclusion is that, that there is not. We will not
move to the volatility adjustments, because we don't see that, that we will beneﬁt from
that in the long-term perspective. And also bear in mind, we have a relatively low risk
proﬁle on our free portfolio, where compared to the rest of the world, I think we did pretty
decent in the ﬁrst quarter. We end up with a loss of the short of 7%, where you see
movements in equities for instance being around 20% in the quarter, and you see all
other asset classes are signiﬁcantly down.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, I think, in general, I will say that the proﬁle and the strategy we have on our
investments has actually proven to be strong and the provide -- you can say, the structure
and the proﬁle that we anticipate. But obviously, it's not good with the movements that
we have seen, but we feel that the strategy we have is what suits us.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Did you implement any sort of hedging maneuver or anything like that in during Q1, and
could you do that, let's say, we would have a second round of really bad markets during
the year?

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

I think, in general, we always look at the asset allocation, also within the various asset
classes. So, we take small adjustments or do small adjustments, but nothing that changes
the overall proﬁle. When it comes to hedging that probably predominantly relates to the
match portfolio, where you can say the strategy we have there of using the covered bonds
to hedge our insurance liabilities. That is something, where you have seen some
movements in this particular quarter with spreads moving out, discounting rates not
following the Central Bank moves, and also the fact that you have seen a reversal of the
long-term rates given the pension funds and others in the longer term of the curve, which
is unusual. So, I would say, no, we have been committed to the usual and ordinary
investment proﬁle and I don't see that that we will change anything material going
forward, we feel conﬁdent that it's the right approach.

Okay. Then, on your capital and your utilization of Tier 2s and Tier 1s, as you pointed out
in your presentation you have maxed it, both of them out. Is that -- I mean, I guess again in
this situation having Tier 1 where, of course, your own funds dropped maybe more than it
had to, because you had utilized all your debt capacity. And again, the same question as
before has what happened in Q1 made you reconsider your usage of debt in own funds
going forward?

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

No. I would say, in general, what we have seen an impact of in this particular quarter is the
movements and also the currencies, where you've seen a particular weakening of the
Norwegian Kroner and Swedish Kroner. So that obviously has an impact on the debt
instruments that we have. But again, I would not say that we changed anything in our
strategy or the way that we have our capital structure put together given these short terms
movements.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Okay. Then onto the operations on the correlation between top-line and technical proﬁts,
you mentioned in your presentations as well that new customers get intro discounts and
they have weaker claims ratios. So, I guess, the ﬁrst question is the weaker claims ratio; is
that due to the intro of discounts or is it also because of higher claims in Italy or how
should we look at that?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Let's say, this is really not a new phenomenon by any means. This is a structural
phenomenon that we have seen in our data throughout many, many years, which is the
main driver being that when you've just purchased an insurance, your awareness of that
insurance is higher than if you purchased it seven years ago, let's say. So, the frequency of
claims is higher. And that is why when you look at any year one customers claim, we don't
compare them just to a year seven or a portfolio frequency of claims. We compare them
to the quality of vintage year one, a year previously, and subsequent years from that. So,
we look -- try to look at the customers per vintage; and in an ideal world, we would only
have customers, who had been here for 10 years, because then the frequency of claims is
low. But of course, we need new customers in the portfolio as well. But the main driver is
that structurally a year one customer always has a higher frequency because of a higher
awareness of the insurance that they just bought.
So, the reason why we highlight it now is, of course that the growth is slightly higher; and
therefore, the amount of year one customers is slightly higher, which we have no doubt
brings more earnings longer term, but also brings a slightly higher claims frequency from
these year one customers. And then also bear in mind that the year one customer also
have the distribution cost to carry, which is of course the second negative driver. So, in the
total context introduction of discount, is the smallest driver, but of course, also adds a
little bit to the equation.

Thank you. I guess, just like you said, the reason I'm asking is that growth is so high now.
So, just trying to model how should we look at this very high growth impacting technical
results. Could you give us any sort of indications as, ﬁrst of all, is the new very high
growth, is it as proﬁtable as all vintages of year one customers, and secondly, how
proﬁtable is it?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well, I guess there's a short-term answer and a long-term answer. I think that what we see
quite clearly particularly in the Danish private business is that the analytical capability in
Alka of being very close to the quality of individual vintages is stronger in Alka than in
Tryg. So, there is a number of areas, where we are putting into place Alka-like
methodologies of being even closer to each vintage and even closer to the quality of
each customer segment, making sure that all our control of year one and subsequent
years of proﬁtability is even stronger. So, on average, I would say that the -- how close
Tryg as a company is to the quality of new business is growing as we speak, and will
become the highest we've ever seen, because we take methodology from Alka.
So as such, I think, we're headed for in a positive direction on that. But of course, longterm, there is a slight negative impact on the underlying improvements. But on the other
hand, we come from a long period, where underlying improvement mainly came from
Private lines, and now we need to see underlying improvement also from commercial
lines. So, I think that is completely in line with the plan and the strategy that we've
communicated during the past year or so.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

So, basically, we should expect a one-to-one correlation between top lines and technical
result, if large claims and weather claims and run oﬀ gains are the same, I guess so.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I think you should expect two things. The general expectation would be that the total
quality of the priority portfolio will be -- remain very high, also including new customers
and the new growth. And then secondly, as we described in the report, you should expect
that Private lines will contribute slightly less to the underlying improvement quarter-onquarter and commercial lines will improve -- contribute slightly more to the group
underlying improvement in Corporate.

Q - Jakob Brink

{BIO 20303720 <GO>}

Thank you. And then ﬁnal question from my side on Tryg Garanti, and this has been sort
of growth driver and you have presented it at your Analyst Days a few times in the past
years. And again, what we have seen here in Q1, does that lead you to think maybe
diﬀerences about the growth aspects of Tryg Garanti? And did you already see any sort of
claims that indicates into that segment?

FINAL

We have not seen any COVID-19 or corona related incidents in Garanti in the ﬁrst quarter.
It's as we mentioned, one of the areas that we expect we might see something in the
quarters to come, but it's also important to bear in mind that typically we have a very
strong reinsurance in the area. So, 80% is sort of the norm, whereas for the larger parts of
the business is up to 90%. And again looking at the approach and the credit ratings et
cetera that we do and perform while providing the guarantees to the customers. This is,
you can say, an area, where we don't plan to change the approach going forward.
I think it's also important to highlight that when looking at the ﬁnancial crisis in 2009 as a
comparison, the Garanti business never reported a loss. Obviously, we saw an impact in
the performance, but they never reported a loss. And I think that just demonstrates, you
can say, the quality and the strength of the business model we have in the area.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

And bear in mind, Jakob, I think, it's a sensible question, but bear in mind that the plan
was always to have a very slow and gradual growth in the Garanti business. If you look at
the period, where we took Garanti from Denmark to Sweden, Norway, and Finland to
where we are today, that period took 10 years. So, that was not exactly catch up or rapid
growth, it was a very slow and gradual process. And also the process we're doing
currently with Garanti is a very slow and gradual process.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, I think, we had with 80% to 90% reinsurance, a very strong quarter earnings and a
very slow and gradual process. We always plan to take the conservative route and we are
still on the conservative routes. So, we really don't see any need to change that.

Q - Mads Thinggaard

{BIO 15369662 <GO>}

Thank you for taking my questions here. I have -- the ﬁrst one if I could come back to the
travel claims. I mean with 30,000 travel claims and it seems a DKK 255 million cost claim,
DKK 8,500 per claim handled, how -- do you have a view of how that will evolve in Q2
and Q3? Will that come up or down? What -- I mean the cost claim for each claim
handled, how do you view that?

FINAL

I think what you should consider when you are viewing the travel claims that are being
incurred is that you have a travel packages and the likes that are being covered
elsewhere. So typically, what you would cover in our incident would be, let's say, you have
put together or travel yourself, you get the ﬂight covered by the airline and so forth, but
then you have hotels booked or you have events booked when you are out.
So, compared to an ordinary travel claim, this will be somewhat lower when it comes to
the claims that are corona related. So, I think your analogy is good. Whether that will
change over time, I don't foresee that it should be dramatically diﬀerent from what we
have seen already as these dynamics obviously will continue to apply going forward as
well.

Q - Mads Thinggaard

{BIO 15369662 <GO>}

Okay. Okay. Thanks. And then the second question, just looking at the corporate
segment, you did some repricing here that were quite signiﬁcant, but still I mean you are
improving the combined ratio, excluding a run-oﬀ, but it's still above DKK 100 million. Are
we going to see more re pricing this year or is that an exercise we will have to await for
next year or next Q1?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

I think it's fair to say that obviously the journey is not over. I think if you look at for instance
the Norwegian market, this is something we have been working with during the last
couple of years. We are probably less into the journey in Denmark and Sweden, but it's
not something that we foresee that, that move will change neither this quarter or next
quarter. So, this is something where we will work diligently with the approach going
forward. And I think, it's important to say that it's a combination of looking at the right
price at the -- for the right risk. So, the risk selection is also a very important part of the
whole journey.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

And bear in mind that in Q1 this year, we put in place new heads of corporate business in
all three countries. We put in place a pan-Nordic underwriting for corporate and
commercial project to increase our capabilities there. So, for us, it's very important to see
the strong application of price increases that will continue for the coming years, and then
we improved the competencies throughout the corporate organization, and for those,
who go hand-in-hand to improve our corporate earnings both short term and longer
term.

Q - Mads Thinggaard

{BIO 15369662 <GO>}

Okay. Okay. So, not done yet. So -- but -- and then I have a ﬁnal question just on the
private premium growth in Denmark. Could you tell us how much is from partners?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well, I could -- I don't think we've ever published that number, but I think a good
indication is that we see the slight growth in number of customers both in direct business
Page 16 of 29

and in the partner business. Of course, with Danske bank for instance as a new partner
that helps the total partner growth, but when we have a strong development in the
retention rates, and also strong cross-selling from new products in the direct business. We
see a strong growth in the direct business as well. And also when the lapse is slightly
lower, we see that the number of customers and direct clients also grows slightly. So,
there's a very good balance between the two.

Hey, guys; good morning. Hope everyone is well. So, a quick one for me on business
interruption. There's a lot of discussion in the market at the moment around policy
wordings and scope for kind of unintended coverage. So I'll be keen to hear your view on
some policy wordings and what . I note that you see some exposures in Denmark and
Norway, and perhaps some in Sweden as well. But I mean, where is the kind of the key
exclusion in the policy wording? So, is it on the extension for infectious disease? Is it on
the proximity clause, i.e. COVID has to be on the premises, do you cover epidemic, not
pandemic? Do you cover pandemic? Is there a names, list of diseases? I'd be keen to kind
of hear the overview of the policy wordings and how comfortable you are that they're
tight enough to kind of exclude what you intend them to? Thank you.

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

Hi. Yes. And all well, I can start saying, so that's a good starting.

A - Morten Hubbe

Jonny, it's a video meeting a day, so we're doing really well.

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Yes. No. I think coming back to the business interruption, the standards in all of our
clauses relates to that, there has to be an event that triggers the claims to be raised. So,
that means whether there is ﬁre or whether there is a ﬂooding of a production side or
whatever it may be that has an impact. The outbreak of COVID-19 was -- would have such
not be recovered. So, therefore, you can say, we are pretty comfortable with the impact
that we will be hit by in that particular line of business.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I think that's somewhat diﬀerent than what you see in many other geographies, where you
would intend to cover business interruption more on a standalone basis. But as Barbara

Page 17 of 29

says, we need a physical event to trigger the business interruption and that is not the case
for these claims.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

So, you basically don't extend business interruption covers for non-physical damage; is
that right?

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

We have a very few exceptions for that, but that is the general approach.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

And that's -- but that's in Denmark and Norway, right? In Sweden, it sounds like there is
some non-physical damage coverage in the policy. But your exposure there is quite low.

Hi, all. Just a quick one from me as well. And thanks for taking my question. It's just mainly
on the reduction in frequency, you've seen in motor, home, and some base of impacts. Do
you think that you could get to the point, where you have to return some premiums back
to policyholders? We've seen this in the U.S. already and Admiral today; yeah, just keen to

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Well, good morning to you as well, Alexander. I think what we've seen is that a few mono
liners that particularly for instance do motor only has chosen to reduce premiums. Of
course, we're a multi-line company and we do all lines of business. And with more than
30,000 additional travel claim so far, and of course, that number will only grow and also,
with the loss on investment income, the logic that we should start to reduce prices on
motor is not clear. And in the same way, we don't plan to increase the prices on travel
insurance, which you could also logically argue that we should.
So typically, we have most of the products with our customers, and typically we see this as
a portfolio composition. So, no, we don't see that pressure. We don't really see that that
would make sense either, but we do appreciate that some of the mono liners out there
could have a diﬀerent perspective being for instance only motor.

Q - Derald Goh

{BIO 20775137 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone. The ﬁrst one is just going back to business interruption. Could
you maybe talk about the take-up of business interruption coverage within your
commercial and corporate clients? I know that the comment in the slide is saying it's
commonly oﬀered, but is that what's assumed that most policies do have business
interruption cover? And secondly, it's going back to the frequency trends as a result of a
lockdown. So, you've given some numbers there from Denmark, but could you maybe
also elaborate on what you're seeing in Norway and maybe to some extent in Sweden
although I know that you're bit smaller there? Thank you.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

I would take the ﬁrst question; you can take the second, Barbara.
I think on the business interruption side, I think, there's really two important factors. One,
we see no change in the way customers and commercial and corporate buy insurance at
the moment. And secondly, as we commented before, in general, we don't sell business
interruption as a standalone policy. It is typically linked to policies, where you need a
physical trigger to trigger business interruption. So, if there is a storm, if there is a
ﬂooding, if there's a ﬁre in the factory, et cetera, that can trigger business interruption. But
if there is no physical trigger like that, there is no business interruption; that is the general
way our policies are structured. There are a few deviations from that, but in general, that is
the picture. So we see no change in that pattern, and that I think, leaves us in a safer place
than the way business interruption is covered in some other geographies than in the
Nordics.

I think maybe a piece of information that could be interesting, that's also now that we see
the outbreak. We see that there is a lockdown in the Nordic area. You see the
predominant part of the workforce working from home. So, what we can see in general is
that the focus on IT security is deﬁnitely increasing, because we know that there is a risk in
you can say for our sake, we have 4,500 employees working from their homes at the
moment compared to 18 locations ordinarily. That goes for most of our clients as well up
until now. And in that context, we have actually been oﬀering cyber insurance to the small
SME commercial clients in order to make sure that if there is some kind of impact or
business disruption given cyber attacks, they will have a protections. And we have been
oﬀering that for free for the next three months to make sure that the businesses can relax
at least in that area.

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Yes. When it comes to the frequency trends that you mentioned in some lines of
businesses, I think, again the pattern, because Denmark and Norway have been running
very much in parallel. You see quite the same pattern in those two economies. So, as
mentioned, we see approximately 15% on our motor frequency for March, but that is of
course, covering four weeks in March, where you see basically no impact in the ﬁrst two
weeks, and then a gradual and higher impact in the last two weeks of the month.
What we have seen now, coming into April, is that partially because of Easter, but partially
because of people really respecting to work from home. That number has increased even
further in the beginning of April. But the pattern in Norway and Denmark has been more
or less the same. Now, if you look out the window, if you go on the roads, you will see
that, because we are gradually starting to reopen, there is more activity on the roads
again, but it will all be something that we monitor quite closely as we still don't know how
you can say that the pandemic will continue to evolve from here in the coming weeks
following the gradual opening.

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes, thank you. Good morning. Starting oﬀ in the corporate business, can you put some
light on what's happening? You're seeing a 10% price increase. We are seeing underlying
combined ratio increasing by 1 percentage point. You're addressing that large claims are
lower this time, but still you see this business generates a solid proﬁt versus cost last year.
Can you give some light on what's happening behind these numbers?

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

You said the growth, the large claims, and what was the last point you mentioned?

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

I was saying that the premium hike oﬀered 10% still underlying combined ratio is up a full
percentage point. And you are seeing the seeded business generating a proﬁt versus the
normal cost despite that you were stating that large claims are down. Normally, I assume
seeded business correlates with the amount of large claims.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

But I think this is really back to a discussion we've had a number of times, where we see
underlying as being a very good phenomenon to use in private lines, and the smaller
SMEs, because there you have stable portfolios, whereas in high-end commercial and in
corporates, for instance, the size of mid-sized claims is extremely volatile. So, from quarter
to quarter that goes up and down. And that really tells you nothing about the quality of
what is going on.
So, I would say internally, we never use underlying claims development in corporate as a
simple measure, because it really doesn't make sense. We use it all the time in private
lines and in the SME business. So, we try to look at this from a much more granular
detailed analytical approach. We see how the price increases come through, and then we
see of course how the claims development is. But having a simple measure of underlying
for corporate business as such really doesn't make sense. So, as I said, we wouldn't
recommend you to go down that route.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

When you see the business making a signiﬁcant proﬁt this quarter, does this imply that

A - Morten Hubbe

No. That is not the case.

So, the problem of course is that it's a combination -- a very few claims can alter this and
for instance, also changes on previous years' claims, which we would then fall into runoﬀs, but it could hit the seeded result as well. So, no, there's really no messaging there.
The problem of course on corporate is that the single individual claims both on the
current year and on previous years will have signiﬁcant impacts also on the seeded
numbers. So, external analytics on that with only public data is really quite tricky; I'm sorry.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Okay. But that's what we have to look and this is one of the areas, where I would assume
there was some improvements. I had taken into account a very big price increase, but
you're basically saying, we have no chances of analyzing that from the outside.

A - Morten Hubbe

But what we can try to do, because the way we see it is that the journey of improving
proﬁtability in corporate business is one that we're taking extremely seriously, both from a
pricing point of view, from exposure reduction point of view, and from a competency and
tools investment point of view. So, what we can do, Per, is we'll try in the coming quarters
to give you more insight and more detail into how can you follow the progress of that.
Because from a simple numbers analytical point of view, corporate is the least transparent
business, because it is not a homogeneous group of customers. It is a composition of
large individual customers. But let us try to elevate the illustrations and the
communication we give for you to monitor that.

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

We have a higher proportion of the long-tailed lines as well, so --

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

My second question -- we have discussed the travel insurance a lot. My second question is
there any upper ceiling in your reinsured program? I assume that could become active if
Southern Europe Still is closed down during the summer and the airline and travel agency
starts to go bankrupt.

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

We don't. You can say we disclose that, but I would just highlight, Per, that -- but bear in
mind that we are not the only ones covering the travel claims as mentioned. If you have a
packaged vacation booked through an agency, you have your ﬂights that you have
booked with the airlines and so forth, those are being covered by some of the packages
that are given also from the central side.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

And what we can say to give you some ﬂavor on that is that the travel reinsurance does
not only cover travel; it actually covers other lines of business as well. So, it's a
combination of various products that is reinsured. I think it's fairly unlikely that we will

FINAL

reach the capacity of that reinsurance. I think that's the essence of your question. We've
never published that number. But I think it's fairly unlikely that we will reach the capacity
max of that reinsurance. I think the worry would probably more be if there is an opening
of travel again and then a subsequent re-closing of traveling. And then we move into a
second phase of reinsurance, where we have to pay our own part of the net claim again.
So, I think that is the likely challenge that we might look into.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Okay. That was very --

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

That is top-load scenario.

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

So, the capacity is not a worry.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Okay. Good. That was the important part. On your DKK400 million SCR reduction that
relates solely to Sweden. I'm just wondering is taking down your SCR 8.5%, Sweden
account for 8.8% of your business, so does this basically imply that there's no capital
requirement that the capital requirement of Sweden have gone to zero?

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

No, you have some geographical diversiﬁcation and other dynamics that impacted as
well. So, it's not only Sweden standalone, but it is a geographical diversiﬁcation that we
get across, you can say, the full business.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

But isn't this model approval does not only apply to the Swedish business, it also applies
to other geographies?

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

You can say the new -- there are two areas of new features in the model approval. One is
speciﬁcally that now Sweden will no longer be looked upon in the standard model, but it
would be part of the partial internal model. But also that we have been able to give them
the history we now have and the experience, we have with the existing partial model.
There are some few adjustments that we have been able to do to the remaining part as
well.

Okay. That explains it. My ﬁnal question, you are addressing somewhere that you are
taking a write down on IT activated items, which hits your combined ratio in this quarter.
I'm just wondering why you don't address it normally. You address those sort of special
items, it's basically even bigger than the COVID-19 impact. Is there a special reason you
don't address it in your slides on your headlines?

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

No. I think we're pretty speciﬁc when it comes to the report. There we have in more
details described what it relates to.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

I'm just wondering, I haven't heard it addressed at all at this presentation. Normally, if you
have more than DKK100 million in extraordinary costs, you would address it, but you
haven't done it. Maybe because there are other things that those in your direction, I will
assume there are costs that also are materially lower due to COVID-19.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

And I think, you're absolutely spot-on, Per, because there is a lot of things that we could
choose to go into more details with like we ordinarily do, but this time we prioritize to
give you, you can say, a clear understanding of the impacts of the situation that we are in
now. Because as we've discussed during the call, what we've seen in the investment
markets have been absolutely unprecedented. What we are experiencing now with the
whole world more or less being impacted by the pandemic and so forth. That is sort of
taking up quite a lot of focus and attention and understanding the business dynamics.
And how it impacts us in the Nordics, is what we have chosen to focus on. So, there is no
speciﬁc reason for not pointing out.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

It is a fair comment, per, and I think if you read the entire report, you'll see that it is
described in there. I think, the way we see it also, there's a positive from Norwegian
pensions, and there's a negative from IT write downs, and the net impact of that is zero.
So, that was sort of our logic. And of course, you can say, yes, but they're not related. No,
they're not related, but they are one-oﬀs and both of them. So, that was more our
thinking, two diﬀerent moving parts that are not usual in a quarter and the net impact is
zero. So, that was our thinking.

Q - Per Gronborg

{BIO 15910340 <GO>}

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Martin Gregers Birk from Carnegie.
Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

FINAL

Q - Martin Gregers Birk

{BIO 19920552 <GO>}

Thank you so much. I have two questions. The ﬁrst question is, it's a follow-up on the
question regarding payback of potential motor premiums, where you argued for monoline versus motor-line insurance companies. But wouldn't it be fair if this goes on for quite
some months on your proﬁtability and your motor portfolio increases quite dramatically to
assume that from a regulatory point of view that there would be demands or a potential
reduction in motor premiums this year? So that'll be my ﬁrst question. And my second
question is to you, Morten, sort of from a holistic view, what has Tryg learned from all this?
What can you do more of? Does this change your view on having ex-FTEs in your
headquarter in Ballerup? I guess this is the ultimate test for an organization.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. I guess, two important questions. I guess, Barbara, we could say that I understand the
logic that if motor claims falls considerably, which it will when economics activity is lower,
could that be a regulator or a public view for reducing premium on that. Of course, you
can never rule it out. I think, in the Nordics there's really no history for authorities to
interfere in the pricing of individual products.
So, we've never really seen that. So, I don't think it's very likely that we would see it in this
situation. And if you look at what is the worry of the authorities at the moment, the worry
is that the banks or the life insurers or the insurers will have trouble standing by the
customers, handling the risk and be solvent and healthy at the same time. That is really
the main worry. I think clearly the non-life companies will generally do well. I think the life
companies and the banks will struggle a bit more, but there's really not a political
atmosphere of one thing to interfere with the pricing of a single product.
And given how high the losses are on travel claims and an investment income, I think it
would really not make sense to require price reductions on motor alone. Of course, if this
dragged on for an extremely long period, and then the net-net became very strongly
positive, then that dialogue might occur, but I think we are many quarters away from such
a dialogue. So, I don't see that happening.
I think on the holistic view, that's actually very important and we're discussing that
internally. There are number of areas, where we shouldn't be -- we shouldn't hurry back to
old ways in all areas. We see for instance that the number of customer meetings we have
on video has exploded. The number of sales and service conversations we can have with
customers on the video is a much higher. We're working on new dynamic 360 degree
tools that will work better online and in video. So, there are a number of areas, where
physical customer meetings no longer has to take place.
Then there are other more complicated business meetings with customers that still needs
to be physical, but I think that digital video more eﬃcient contact development will jump
Page 25 of 29



FINAL

several years ahead, and we should use that to a high extent. And then of course, the fact
that we are able to have more than 4,000 employees at home at the same time, and our
eﬃciency actually increases, and our customer satisfaction is all time high. It shows us that
we can work more from home than today. We will work to exploit that; and of course, we
need to be able to see which employees perform better at home and which employees
will lack the motivation and the environment and the social contact, and actually whose
performance and satisfaction of work will decline, and we see both. So, I think we'll work
diﬀerently, both related to the customers and related to the employees, and there are real
opportunities in there.
We did an HR survey actually, where we asked the employees related to corona
speciﬁcally, how pleased are you with communication, and they scored 4.5 out of 5. And
how motivated are you and they scored more than four as well. So, I think, those also are
very pleasing results, but I think digital and online and ﬂexibility of working from home
will increase after corona.

Q - Martin Gregers Birk

{BIO 19920552 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Okay. Thank you. Just a follow-up on my ﬁrst one; I mean when you look at the
banks, it seems to be that there is a high demand from regulators and from politicians of
showing so-called Sampo sent. And the insurance sector so far hasn't really been
exposed to that part. And then I could only think about motor insurance. But do you see
any other product lines or any other areas of your business, where they could become -where there could be increased demands for either regulators or politicians in any of your
business areas, where you have to show Sampo sent and thereby give up potential future
revenue?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Not really. I think that we're seeing the insurance companies being quite open and helpful
to the customers already on their own initiative. So, for instance, telling customers that
they can move from annual payments to monthly payments helping their liquidity. If there
is a VAT or again liquidity angles, we can wait on the payment there. If there are suppliers
that asks us for early payment from us to them helping their liquidity, we are forthcoming
on that. If there are commercial customers, who reduce their employees or they reduce
the number of lorries and bands or their employees sit still at home, so they need a less
dangerous workers comp registration with a lower premium, we're forthcoming on that.
So, we're trying to do a number of things to help customers, and show Sampo sent
through that.
So I think, the industry is doing well and helping well. But at the end of the day, banks
should play a larger role when there's a liquidity challenge than insurance companies. I
don't think that is structurally lack of logic, but we do help in a number of areas.

Collier. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.

FINAL

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Good morning to you as well. Just to follow-up on your last answer really, and the
potential for new businesses as well as potential loss of business or premiums in this
COVID-19 situation. Finally, in Norway, you have seen the oil dropping heavily back again.
So, could you elaborate on how you see the potential loss of revenues from the oil
situation as we saw some years back, could hurt your premium growth out on Norway?
Thank you.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, it's clearly -- I think, the driver you're asking about is quite clear, both in the
commercial business and in the corporate business. There are businesses that will go
bankrupt in the SME segments, because their helping packages will not be fast enough.
That will have a negative impact on top-line growth in SME. There are corporate
customers, who'll have a fewer employees, less activity, less lorries, less bands, less new
production, which all other things equal will be negative for the top-line in corporate as
well.
And then on the other hand, we see a private lines business, where our growth is
extremely strong. And then, of course, in commercial and corporate, the top-line growth
reported is helped by price increases, which will continue. So, I think, there will be a netnet negative underlying growth contribution from all of the Nordic countries in
commercial and corporate. As far as we can see the impact on our total growth will not be
very signiﬁcant given that we are predominantly a private lines business, but there will be
a negative impact. But trying to see through the magnitude of that given the uncertainty
of how societies will reopen, that is simply not possible yet. We've done some internal
modeling, which shows a reduction in corporate particularly and to some extent SME,
limited impact on the group, but the reality is that the visibility is very limited, but the
visibility is strong enough to show that the technical result target will be met, and for us
that is the most important.

Q - Jan Erik Gjerland

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

Perfect. And on the oil related part, is it anything that worries you? Have you changed
your sort of corporate and commercial business lines in Norway out of the oil industry as
just here you talked about exiting the ﬁsh farming industry. Have your sort of exited your
oil-related exposure or is it still the same kind of level as you've seen in the past?

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

The reality is that our direct business exposure to the oil related industry is extremely
limited. So, you shouldn't expect that to be a negative driver. What is diﬃcult to see
through is that of course, there is a lot of sub suppliers to the oil related industry. And we
of course, insure a number of those sub supplies. So, that is where we could see the risk,
but direct exposure is very limited.

{BIO 5346031 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay. Just one ﬁnal then; if I look into your notes, it looks like your combined ratio in
Norway is around 101%. Just could you shed some light into the diﬀerent kind of
proﬁtability in the private commercial and corporate? Just so you can understand where
we potentially will see the highest price increases going into 2020 and potentially into
2021.

A - Barbara Plucnar Jensen

{BIO 17487867 <GO>}

Yes. I mean, if you look at commercial and corporate, there we have been working with
price increases in particular in the corporate for a longer time frame that we have done
that in the commercial business. We see that the acceptance rate is quite strong also in
the commercial segment, because you can say we have had a period of time with quite
extensive growth, but probably also at too fair or too low prices. So, that is something
where we have seen a signiﬁcant increase in the recent quarters.

Bloomberg Transcript

But it is as we also discussed before related to the overall corporate segment, something
that we will continue to see going forward. And then on the private side obviously, right
now, you see a very high growth with some of the dynamic drivers that we spoke about
with higher cost in the beginning with you can say higher usage of the policies and so
forth. But if you look at it, we are maturing the portfolio that we have and are very close to
you can say that part of the business. So, on the price increase question, I would say
expect that to continue to the levels that we have seen in commercial and corporate, a bit
into the future as well.

A - Morten Hubbe

{BIO 7481116 <GO>}

And fair to say that commercial and corporate Norway has been the two most challenging
areas across the group and that remains to be the case. So, we're pleased with the price
increases that is starting to help, but the absolute level of combined ratio in those two
areas are not at all satisfactory. And they will improve in the next couple of years.
