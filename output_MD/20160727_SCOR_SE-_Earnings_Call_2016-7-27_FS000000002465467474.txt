MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the SCOR Group 2016 First Half Results
Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would now like to
hand the call over to Mr. Bertrand Bougon, Head of Investor Relations and Rating
Agencies. Please go ahead, sir.

Bertrand Bougon

{BIO 18934799 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the SCOR Group H1 2016 results concall. Before starting this presentation, please consider our disclaimer on page two, which
indicates that the first half 2016 financial information included in this presentation has
been subject to the completion of limited review by SCOR's independent auditor.

With this, I would like to give the call to Mr. Denis Kessler, CEO and Chairman of SCOR
Group, who is joined on this call by the entire committee (00:48) team.

FINAL

Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Thank you, Bertrand, and good morning, everyone. First of all, once again, SCOR
produced strong results this quarter. Of course, it's a quarter that marks the completion,
as well as the successful achievement of the Optimal Dynamics strategy plan. As you
know, it's a three-year plan. We launched it three years ago and it ended end of June,
2016.
The strategy has proven its resilience and enables the group to absorb all kinds of shocks.
And I can refer to the events of this quarter as a high number of Nat Cats experienced in
the second quarter of 2016. But also another shock, which is the uncertainties surrounding
Brexit, another big concern is (01:41) financial markets and primary insurance companies in
the UK. We demonstrate also a capacity to absorb the lasting trends affecting our
industry, notably a lengthy soft P&C pricing cycle, and the pronounced ultra-low interest
rate environment.

Bloomberg Transcript

With regard to the results themselves, SCOR wrote €6.7 billion of gross written premiums
in the first half of 2016, and that represents a robust growth of 5.9%. It's a very good sign
of quality (02:18) of the group, at constant foreign exchange rates. The growth rate is
3.7% at current exchange rates.
We (02:28) a strong contribution for SCOR Global Life, with a growth of 10.2% and the fact
that we were able to grow also in P&C, of course at a lower speed, proved the efficiency
of the diversification strategies that we've been pursuing for the last 14 years. SCOR
Global P&C delivered very successful June-July renewals with premiums increasing by
14.2%, while prices remain quite stable. And this is also after the April renewals, excellent
news for the group. Victor will discuss those renewals in more details later on in his own
presentation.
Overall, SCOR produces a net income of €275 million for the first half of 2016 with a
return on equity of 8.9% and with a strong adjusted solvency ratio. Why adjusted? Just
because we're going to call two debts really this week and early August. So, we don't
take them into account when we estimate the solvency ratio. And so, the solvency ratio
revised, which I just mentioned it, which is 210%, absolutely in line with the targets defined
in Optimal Dynamics.
With Optimal Dynamics, by the way, completed at the end of June, I'm very pleased
(04:08) to announce that we have successfully achieved all the targets defined in the plan
with a return on equity of 1,111 basis points, above the risk-free-rate, on average, over the
three-year period of the plan, and an estimated adjusted solvency ratio of 210% at the
conclusion of the plan, well within the optimal range of 185% to 220%. So, we are
extremely happy to demonstrate that we are able to deliver on a commitment and to be
able to show you those good results three years after we announced the target.

FINAL

We will certainly spend some time with the achievement of the Optimal Dynamics plan in
more detail during the IR Day. And at the IR Day, we'll present (05:07) that will cover the
next few years, early September.
Before giving the floor to Mark, who will give you more details on the financial
performance of the group during the first semester, I would like to take a minute to speak
about Brexit, which represents globally a disruptive shock, but not for SCOR. We can say
that, if we look closely at the impact of Brexit for SCOR, the implied risk is minimal,
extremely marginal from a financial perspective, as well as from a business and
operational perspective.
If you consider the financial risk of Brexit for SCOR, it's extremely limited. The SCOR
hedging and capital management policies ensures strict IFRS congruency between its
asset portfolio and its underwriting commitments, totaling £1.7 billion, which represents,
roughly speaking, 9% of total invested assets. Hence, any devaluation of the pound,
which, by the way, already took place, would not have a significant negative currency
effect on the group. And with only 6% of the shareholders' equity denominated in British
pounds, around £300 million, by the way, we believe that the group will not really suffer
from the consequence of Brexit in terms of devaluation of the pound.

Bloomberg Transcript

The group, only its UK-based real estate is in the prime location, by the way, Lime Street
in the city (06:51) and is occupied by SCOR and so the question marks about the evolution
of real estates in UK will not affect the group.
On the asset side of SCOR, the portion of assets denominated in pound sterling has
been positioned in a very prudent manner. In preparation of the referendum on Brexit, we
are mostly invested in cash and cash equivalents and bonds with an immaterial exposure
to UK equities and we have a very short duration for the British pound portfolio of 2.7
years, which give us, of course, flexibility.
As far as operational risk is concerned, it's minimal again. You know that the group's
platform is global, but it's centered. We operate from many countries in the world, and
we're absolutely able to serve our clients worldwide, including United Kingdom, whatever
the solution for Brexit will be chosen. We are headquartered in Europe, and this facilitates
a lot of cross-border transactions. Therefore, again, we will be able to continue operating
the way we do today with no disruption for our clients.
Let's talk about business risks, that was a dimension that we have to deal with. And
certainly, pressures from Brexit would be focused on the cross-border direct business,
which is marginal for SCOR. Most of SCOR's UK direct operations is written in continental
Europe, and stands in the range of £70 million. And if you look also at the Channel 2015
Lloyd's Syndicate, this represents about £20 million risk (08:48). None of this material to
SCOR, and we could even, according to the final decision on the Brexit rules, maintain this
business. So, therefore, we consider the Brexit is certainly not a good news for the world,
at least by my opinion, and certainly for Europe, maybe for UK, but this is not affecting
SCOR Group in no ways; very marginally, if we have a negative effect.

The group in a very good shape. We're viewing the group's operations, group's strategy,
the group's performance for the last year, because we're preparing the new plan, to be
disclosed early-September. And really that's my intimate conviction that we are in a very
good shape. We are well-positioned. We demonstrate quarter after quarter our capacity
to expand profitably. And we demonstrate quarter after quarter capacity to absorb shocks
(09:50) Nat Cats have been quite heavy this quarter, but we also – we demonstrate the
capacity to absorb adverse developments of a financial environment. So, we are
optimistic about the next three years that we will show – demonstrate early-September.
With that, Mark, the floor is yours to go into the details into the financials.

Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

Thank you, Denis, and good morning, everyone. Moving on to slide seven, I'll walk you
through the key financial highlights of the first half of the 2016 results. SCOR wrote €6.7
billion of gross written premiums in the first half of 2016, representing robust growth of
just under 6% at constant foreign exchange rates. The year-on-year top line growth
benefited in particular from the strong contribution of SCOR Global Life with a 10.2% rise
at constant exchange rates.

Bloomberg Transcript

During the first half of 2016, SCOR Global P&C's gross written premiums were broadly
stable at constant exchange rates, and slightly decreased by 2% at current exchange
rates for reasons that were explained during the first quarter earnings call.
Overall, the net income reaches €275 million in the first half. P&C net combined ratio
stands at 93.8%. Our Life technical margin continues to outperform at 7.1%, while SCORE
Global Investments in the extremely low yield and uncertain environment delivers a solid
return on invested assets of 3.1%.
Going to page nine. Shareholders' equity is €6.3 billion, corresponding to a book value of
€33.79 per share, representing a significant discount to our current share price. And you'll
notice several main effects impacting the shareholders' equity; the strong net income that
we generated, the revaluation reserve for a positive €149 million effect due to the lower
interest environment, and the currency translation adjustment of negative €119 million,
largely due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the euro, although this number has
diminished from the €191 million that we recorded in the first quarter of 2016, as we saw
significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar following the Brexit results.
The other items were principally composed of treasury share purchases. SCOR's financial
leverage stands at 31.8% as at the June 30, temporarily above the range indicated in
Optimal Dynamics. It would stand at 25.5% adjusted for the redemption of the two debts
callable, which will take place tomorrow, July 28, and next week on August 2. This ratio
also reflects the successful placement of a dated subordinated notes issue in the amount
of €500 million in May – this past May. With this issuance, SCOR has secured the financing
of its new plan developments and beyond.

FINAL

So let's move to page 10. SCOR delivers a robust operating cash flow of €450 million on
a year-to-date basis, thanks to the contribution of both business engines. And if we have
a look at the cash flow from financing activities, you'll note that it's principally reflecting
dividend payment and debt issuance proceeds, which occurred during May.
The total liquidity of the group reaches €2.8 billion at the end of June, representing a
substantial increase year-on-year, in line with the temporary pause of the rebalancing of
the investment portfolio but also to fund the pending debt repayments of approximately
€850 million that will occur later this week and early next week.
I'll now turn it over to Victor to comment on the P&C results and the June-July renewals.

Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Mark, and good morning. We are very pleased with the three sets of figures
that SCOR Global P&C is reporting for the quarter, year-to-date and recent renewals,
respectively. The June-July renewals were both confirming and encouraging. They were
confirming because we have been able to manage the portfolio to contain the market
downward pricing pressure and to deliver quality stable pricing at renewal, as it is shown
on slide 12. Expected profitability remains at or above our targets in terms of technical
ratio and return on risk adjusted capital.
They have also been confirming because our initiatives continue to develop positively.
We've made good progress in the U.S. and in Alternative Solutions in EMEA. In the U.S., we
achieved a 31% growth rate considering both Cat and non-Cat together. Growth was
driven by two large contracts that contributed €47 million of increased premium. We add
to non-renewals a small number of treaties with particularly weak pricing. On balance, new
business has better expected profitability than both the portfolio on average and the
business that was non-renewed.
Second word to describe the renewal is encouraging. Well, encouraging because while
respecting the profitability targets, SGPC has grown renewed expected premium by 14%.
Also, because during these renewals, we have seen signs of clear and broad resistance
to further deteriorations of terms and conditions. Overall, conditions at the renewal
remain difficult for reasons that you are all familiar with. SGPC's client, nevertheless,
continue to respond favorably to the continual and regular improvements that SCOR has
made for more than a decade now.
We see more business than ever. We have a market-leading rating. We have stronger
team and tools and we are clearly positioned as a Tier 1 reinsurer. This is evident in our
renewals. Moving on to the results of the quarter, we had a profitable quarter despite a
high number of Nat Cat's. The net combined ratio for the quarter was 97.5% including the
effect of the reserve release and a Nat Cat load that was twice the budgeted 6% annual
Nat Cat ratio.
The second quarter is typically the lowest Nat Cat quarter in the industry. We estimate
that the Nat Cat ratio from this year second quarter events consider altogether and

FINAL

relative to expectations for a typical second quarter is 1 in about 15 year written (16:44)
period for our portfolio. This analysis is, of course, subject to all the caveats that need to
be put on a seasonal analysis. Altogether, we are very pleased with the quarter results.
Within this 97.5% net combined ratio for the second quarter, the attritional loss ratio
stands at 52.7% plus 3.1% to be reinstated in order to neutralize the effect of the €40
million reserve release.
The favorable trend observed in the sum of the attritional ratio of 55.8% and the
commission ratio of 25.8% demonstrate that we have a solid and stable portfolio. On a
year-to-date basis, the net combined ratios stands at 93.8% and the year-to-date
normalized net combined ratio at 94.5%. Within this net combined ratio, year-to-date Nat
Cat contribute 6.9%, which means that the trend has been realigned towards the
budgeted 6% and on Nat Cat ratio, following a first quarter with almost no Nat Cat activity.
Overall, half year results confirm that SGPC has achieved the target of Optimal Dynamics.
Indeed, we met the Optimal Dynamics plan, which ran from July 2013 to June 2016 on
both financial and strategic goals.
Looking forward, we continue to expect to achieve our previously indicated guidance of a
growth of 3% to 4% for the full year gross written premium at constant exchange rates.
We make this determination on the basis of factors such as the growth of 0.6% at
constant exchange rates at mid-year, 2.2% for the second quarter, the success of the
June-July renewals, and the pipeline for the rest of the year.

I will now hand over to Paolo for the presentation of the Life Division results.

Paolo de Martin

{BIO 15930577 <GO>}

Thank you, Victor. Moving on to page 14 of the presentation, I'm pleased to report that in
the first half of 2016 SCOR Global Life continues to deliver strong and profitable growth.
Our gross written premiums reached €3.9 billion, which represents a growth of 10.2% at
constant exchange rate or 8.3% at current exchange rate. Our new business pipeline
continues to be healthy across all product lines with new business margins expected to
meet or exceed the group profitability target. During the first half of 2016, we continue to
successfully execute our global franchise strategy providing flow of profitable new
business in both Protection and Financial Solutions, with all our regions contributing to the
growth.
New business underwritten in our longevity line of business in the second half of 2015
particularly in the third quarter of 2015 contributed positively to the development of our
In-force premiums in 2016. We expect growth in premiums to normalize at approximately
5% at constant exchange rate for the full-year. With third quarter of 2016 expected to be
almost flat compared to third quarter of 2015 driven by last year's strong production.
Overall, the 5% growth expected for the year brings us in line with the Optimal Dynamics
plan assumption of 6% per annum growth between 2013 and 2016, which we have
successfully delivered.

We will provide you more details on this and on our future prospects during the IR Day in
September. Overall, technical performance over the first half of 2016 remains robust with
a technical margin standing at 7.1% above the 7% assumed in Optimal Dynamics. We've
been able to deliver this technical margin, thanks to both the profitability of our new
business and the results of the In-force portfolio in line with our expectations.

FINAL

I will now hand over to François for more details on our group investment strategy.

François de Varenne

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Paolo. Moving on to slide 15, SCOR total investment portfolio reached €27.6
billion at the end of June with an invested asset portfolio of €18.8 billion compared to
€18.2 billion at the end of March. Market condition remained very challenging this quarter.
Economic and financial uncertainties are still very high, and were supported by the Brexit
vote, which impacted financial markets at the end of June and sent interest rates at new
historical lows in all major currency.
In this context, SCOR Global Investment has tactically reinforced its prudent investment
strategy consistent with the portfolio positioning implemented since June 2015 in order to
preserve our investment portfolio and the wealth of SCOR shareholders. As a
consequence, we have maintained our liquidity at a very high level of 14%. Ahead of the
Brexit votes, SCOR has positioned it's GBP portfolio very defensively. It is mostly invested
in cash and high-grade fixed income with an average rating of AA- in a very short duration
of 2.7 years. Besides, SCOR has almost no exposure to UK equities and has de-risked it's
corporate bond portfolio by getting rid of exposure to the UK, Italian and Spanish financial
sector exposures.
The high quality for fixed income portfolio has been maintained as well with a stable
average rating of AA-. Moreover, SCOR Global Investments has maintained a very strict
policy of avoiding any sovereign exposure to euro payable (22:17) countries. At the end of
June, expected cash flows from the fixed income portfolio over the next 24 months
stands at €7.3 billion facilitating the dynamic management of our investment policy as
soon as market condition (22:32). In spite of the adverse economic environment and the
prolonged low yield context in all major currencies, SCOR Global Investments manages to
deliver a strong and recurring return on invested assets, which stands at 3.1% for the first
half 2016. This quarter enable us to deliver an average return on invested assets over
Optimal Dynamic of 3% above the strategic plan assumption made in September 2013,
which was to reach this level by the end of the plan.
With this, I will hand over to Bertrand Bougon for the conclusion of the presentation.

Q&A

FINAL

Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, we will now move on to the Q&A session. We have our first
question from Vinit Malhotra from Mediobanca. Please go ahead. Your line is open.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Thank you. So, I just wanted to quickly check on the trend in the running income. So, sorry,
both my questions are on the asset side. The €93 million reported for the ordinary
income, I would assume has probably a sizeable portion, say, €15 million or so from equity
dividends. So adjusted for that, the fixed income yield, if you like is quite low this quarter, I
thought, at least compared to what I had expected. Please could you comment a bit if
there's any special here that we should note? So, that's the first question.

Bloomberg Transcript

Second question is – we always hear about the maturity of the assets over the next two
years and that number today is €7.3 billion, was €6.8 billion last quarter and used to be in
€5 billion odd range few years ago. So, this number is obviously just increasing in size as
SCOR keeps holding on to its short-duration strategy. But could you just comment on
where are you thinking of investing? Is it more corporate credit? Is it more real estate? If
you just refresh our memory on that, please? Thank you very much.

A - François de Varenne
Thank you, Vinit, for your two questions. On the first one, that's true that in the past we
used to have some seasonality in Q2 on dividend, especially on the equity portfolio and
continental names (26:43) since the tradition is that the dividend upgrade in Q2. If you
look at the composition of our equity portfolio, first in absolute terms today, it's what – it's
less than 2% of the portfolio. And if you move to slide 47, which gives you the breakdown
of the equity portfolio, most of this equity portfolio today is made of convertible bonds.
So, let's say that the seasonality on dividend now is almost immaterial in this set of results.
For your second question, that's true. We increased the liquidity in the portfolio. And you
have two effects this quarter. The fact that we remain still relatively shocked in terms of
duration. We maintained a high level of liquidity of 14 points. Those 14 points include the
€850 million of cash of debt redemption for tomorrow and next week. That was
mentioned by Mark at the beginning of the call. So, for the investment strategy over the
next few months and quarter, we'll just ask you to wait for a few weeks in early
September to have a full update of future investment strategy.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

All right. Thank you, François.

Thank you. We'll take our next question from Andrew Ritchie from Autonomous. Please go
ahead. Your line is open.

FINAL

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Oh, hi there. Sorry. One quick follow-up question on investment return. I think you talked
about at the end of Q1 that you felt that there was a 20 basis point opportunity cost from
the holding of excess liquidity. Is that still the right kind of level? And maybe remind us as
to what you think about the likely investment return for 2016 and whether the opportunity
cost has risen? The second question, you see debt in the quarter. Pro forma, your
leverage is at the higher end of your target or it's kind of at the high end of your target.
I'm talking about pro forma the repayments that you make tomorrow. I'm just curious to
know what motivated you to issue the debt in the quarter? Was it purely opportunistic, or
was this very early refinancing of retentions in a couple of years' time? What was the
thinking behind it? Thanks.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - François de Varenne
Andrew, that's true that during the Q4 2015 result, I mentioned and indicated return on
invested assets in the range of 2.8%, 3.1% for the full year 2015. I indicated also during the
Q1 presentation that the temporary rederisking of the portfolio implemented earlier this
year and pursue this quarter in the context of the Brexit vote, with notably high level of
cash, and this level is what, 10% above or higher than our long-term strategic level, would
have an impact of 20 basis points on annual basis this year. Since the Brexit decision, has
materially impacted as you know downward interest rate everywhere in the world, which
are reaching new historical low. I will update you in September during the new strategic
plan presentation on our future investment strategy and expected financial performance
for the full year and during the next three years.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

So, I guess the 20 basis points must've increased because you're cut short. And
meantime, yields have fallen. Is that not fair?

A - François de Varenne
That's correct. I mean, if you look at the reinvestment rate, it was 2% at the beginning of
the year, and it's 1.8% at the end of June this year. So, you have the effect of the decrease
of interest rate everywhere in the world.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay. So, the effect of opportunity cost has gone up, then I guess, is the right way to think
about it?

A - François de Varenne
Yes.

Mark, on the strategy leverage?

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

We did the €500 million debt issuance in late May. It was definitely opportunistic given
where market conditions were prior to the Brexit vote, Brexit results. It's something that
allows us to really lengthen the duration of our hybrid debt financing. It really locks in the
long-term financing of the debt structure in the group for the next 10 years to 12 years. It
also serves to support the next strategic plan so we can say categorically that the
financing is secure and locked in. And the last point I would add is that the average yield
on our subordinated debt that's outstanding is actually quite low, probably the best of the
four major European reinsurers.

Operator
Now, we'll take our next question from Kamran Hossain from RBC. Please go ahead. Your
line is open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Hi. Morning, everyone. I've got two questions on P&C. The first one is just on the
combined ratio. If I look back to your – if I look at your comments today about the 94.5%
being in line with your expectations. Maybe I'm just really picky. But if I look at your
guidance earlier this year, you think suggest – standard renewals that net combined ratio
would be close to 94%. Q1 you then said 94.3% is close to 94%, which I agree. Is 94.5%
the limit of what you would say is close to 94%? First question one is probably a semantics
one. It probably me being picky – but that's my first question.
And the second one, on the retrocession program, obviously, you reduced your
catastrophe loss expectation to 6 points this year on the basis of an improved retro
program. How do you expect that to perform in, I guess in a severe hurricane season? I
kind of look at this course and see your 12% cat loss, and I'm not sure how much benefit
you got from it or kind of how we might think about it reacting if there are further large
losses for remainder of the year? Thanks very much.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Well, I don't know about the semantics but for me, I mean we are on 94%, we are
midyear. We've no reason to believe that the 94% doesn't stand today. We are at 94.5%.
We had a bit of a heavy quarter. For me I mean, no real comment about that. I mean, we
fluctuate on 94% and that's where we are. It's still a pretty good one. And regarding the
retrocession, yeah, I mean, we improved our retrocession. I mean, this second quarter is
mixed of all sorts of perils, all sorts of region, none of them really being of very substantial
natures so our retrocession is primarily a capital protection.

Page 10 of 22



FINAL

Company N ame: SCOR SE
Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity
Date: 2016-07-27

So, those losses that we had this year on the second quarter as it stands today will get
very little contribution from retrocession, and it's totally normal. It's what those losses are
doing, they are just eroding the underlying to our aggregate covers. Some of our
aggregate covers are getting closer to kick, but none of them has kicked. And it's not
totally – it's not abnormal at all. It's totally normal considering the structure of our
retrocession. And you look at it while you cannot assess that on a quarter. It's even very
difficult to assess them on a yearly basis, so I mean at half year we are at 6.9%. It's a
mixture of – at first quarter we had no cat activity, and second quarter where we have
pretty high Nat Cat activity.
I mean, if you look at it for any reinsurer and in the quarters that are heavy in terms of Cat
exposure is the third quarter because of the hurricanes in the U.S. And Q1 and Q4
because of the European storm. So, normally Q2 is a pretty quiet quarter, while this year is
a bit of an exception to that, which is why we tried to calculate what sort of return period
such a second quarter as this one is having on our portfolio and while we came out with a
figure of around 15-year return period which means that it's certainly a bit of an exception.

Hi guys. Thank you very much. On the June-July renewals, when you flag those two large
contracts. Can you give us a bit more detail about what those contracts are and how
exactly you won them? Because you said that they were priced more attractively than
existing business, presuming you won that business from somebody else who doesn't
agree. So, if you could just walk us through how you won that business. And, then,
secondly, as you think to the future the Solvency II ratio of 210% even after the debt
increase. You're still only within your target range when your big three peers in Europe
have massively blown through their upper limits. How do you interpret that when you think
about your strategic strengths and weaknesses for the future? Thank you.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

I'm not going to give you a lot of details about those two. What I think is important for me
to highlight those two is to confirm the fact that while our growth in the U.S. is a very, very
discipline growth. And the underlying growth, while it's a mix, of course, of cancellation
and new business. Well, the growth since you exclude those two contracts is something
like 4.5% overall at renewal, which means that we are having a very disciplined sort of
approach of our U.S. activity. Those two contracts while, both are proportional, one is
property, one is multiline. Didn't steal them from anyone else. Those are new contracts
from two clients. One is a syndicated to some extend and the other one is principal to
principal.

Thank you, Victor. And maybe (37:40) on the solvency ratio.

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

We can't really comment on the solvency capital management strategy of our peers. I
mean, we have clearly set out our solvency management framework in our target range.
We've consistently managed our solvency position within the optimal range. That is one of
the strategic targets which the group has set out. And we've adhered to what we have
disclosed, and that is really the backbone of our entire capital management strategy. So,
we were just very consistent with what we set out for the current strategic plan. We are
obviously reviewing this, and we'll give an update on this at the next IR Day with a view at
the next strategic plan. But for now, we are just working within the framework which we
have set ourselves.

Just given your passing remarks there, are there any important issues on Solvency II and
your own model and framework that you have been reviewing recently?

A - Mark Kociancic

{BIO 17852409 <GO>}

No. No. I mean, our model has been approved. We are happy with it. As it works, we are
using it for risk and solvency management purpose. We've been doing this for a long
period. So, we are comfortable with the model, with our Solvency II position. We are not
affected by the industry debates about things like changes to the UFR and so on which
has zero impact on us. So, there's no issue which is keeping us awake when it comes to
our solvency. And we are very comfortable with, as I said, both the model and our
solvency framework.

FINAL

Q - Xinmei Wang

{BIO 17860767 <GO>}

Hi. I have two questions, please. The first is on the investment income. On the real estate
portfolio, François said last quarter that we should expect more to come in the next
couple of quarters on realized gains in real estate. We didn't see any in 2Q, and there's
still a stock of unrealized gains there. Is that something we should still be factoring in, in
the next couple of quarters and something you're thinking about to achieve the target
ROI? First question.
The second is on how to think about using reserve releases. You have strong reserve
margin and clearly that gives you optionality to use it for high Nat Cat in the quarter.
Should we think of it as quarters with – with high Nat Cat meaning that we should see
reserve releases or with the base case to be still to – so you are factoring no reserve
releases and sort of how should we think about that in context of the Nat Cat
environment? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - François de Varenne
On the real estate portfolio (41:05) I'll explain the strategy we've got. We like to work our
asset and to create values. So, that's true that we sold one building with total return of
13% since the initial acquisition and that was in the account in Q1. If you look at the
annualized gain in the real estate portfolio that's in the appendix on slide 50. We still have
a material amount of unrealized gain on this portfolio. Those asset are not yet mature, so
don't expect in the next few weeks or months something, but throughout the next
strategic plan for sure.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Victor, on the reserve release?

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Well, I think we have commented on that quite number of time regarding the fact that
basically we have a margin above best estimate that is a management margin. That
margin is there to be used in rather exceptional circumstances, but we consider that this
quarter, as I said, I mean I mentioned the sort of return period. So for us it's a heavy
quarter. But we do €40 million of release to smooth the quarter as we did in the past in
few other occasion, exactly in the same circumstances, by the way. So, nothing really
special. Just a continuity of the practice that we have had for more than five years now.

Q - Xinmei Wang

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two from me. So, firstly, on
pricing trends, I mean you guys actually sound a bit bullish compared to some of the
comments that we've heard so far. I mean pricing currently stable at sort of minus 0.2%. I
mean I see a comment there, the proportional lines are improving in places. I just
wondered if you could give us a bit more color on that, and how you're seeing
proportional rates going forward. And also in non-proportional, which obviously continues
to get sort of less negative? Secondly, you've reiterated guidance for P&C, GWP growth
at 3% to 4% constant currency. Obviously, there's a bit of catch up to come from the H1
levels, and the June and July renewals are helpful, but I just wondered if you could give us
a bit more into the pipeline there, and how you're seeing it. Thank you.

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

Both for you Victor.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

I think on the growth, you can see that the second quarter is already better at plus 2.2%. I
think June-July are coming very nicely. We have a number of discussion today on
contracts, which are not as substantial as the two I mentioned in the second quarter, but
that each of them is substantially enough have an impact. So overall, I think we are pretty
confident that at the end, we do the catch up and we lend more as where we thought we
would be ending. So difficult for me to give you information about the pipeline. It's pretty
much – but we think we have a number of discussions sufficient considering a reasonable
hit ratio to bring us within that, that sort of range.

Pricing trend?

FINAL

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

On the pricing side, as you noticed, while reinsurance non-proportional continues to be
the most competitive end, I mean, there is least competition on proportional, in particular
on proportional that requires a real knowledge of local markets. There is more resistance
on the commissions, which means that the negotiation on commissioning in proportional
is getting tougher, and to some extent, I mean, we would benefit from it. So, I think that's
– and that's primarily starting from the U.S. position.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. We'll take our next question from Frank Kopfinger from Deutsche Bank. Please
go ahead. Your line is open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Frank Kopfinger

{BIO 16342277 <GO>}

Thanks. I have two questions, and I would like to come back to the pricing. As you have
now disclosed a stable pricing outcome, looking forward, would you say that we are now
at the bottom? And do you see chances and what are the chance – what are the risks that
we are now at the bottom?
And my second question is for François on the liquidity share of the 40% (sic) [14%] (46:17)
on investments. I think, in Q1, you mentioned that going forward by the end of the year,
you would like to bring down this high liquidity share. Now, as of Q2, you kept it due to the
uncertainties also on Brexit. But how should we think about this going forward for the
second half of this year? And what would be the target range that you would look at?

A - François de Varenne
Well, from the liquidity to, as you see, we have 14% of liquidity today, of which, almost 4.5
points that will disappear tomorrow and next week with the debt redemptions. Going
forward, let's say between the summer and the end of the year, the intention now is to
decrease (47:10) amount of liquidity and to come back to a, let's say, normal level.
In terms of pricing, are we bottoming up or down or bottoming?

A - Denis Kessler

{BIO 1498477 <GO>}

I think, first of all, our communication is not massively different from the communication of
one of our peers, who has been communicating on pricing that we agree not to name
them. And I think we are pretty much in line, so we are not the only ones. And regarding
whether we are at the bottom or not, it seems that in certain areas, yes. And it seems
Page 15 of 22



Company N ame: SCOR SE
Company Ticker: SCR FP Equity
Date: 2016-07-27

FINAL

that a number of others, no. But I think it's very, very difficult to make a general statement.
I mean each client is having a purchase policy and a purchase strategy and it's specific to
that client. What I'm saying is that for those clients want to rely on leader insurers and
reinsurers that having the ability to price the business, I think, yes. In number of cases, it's
close to the bottom. Then, if those buyers of reinsurance will want to broaden the source
of capacity and go to different markets, different reinsurers, well, they can still find
flexibility.
As far as we are concerned, all our business is priced by our own people and we have our
targets and when the business doesn't meet the target, then we enter into negotiation,
where basically the relationship with the client becomes the driver of the overall
discussion on the profitability we get from the client.

Bloomberg Transcript

And then, because all of the job we do at the moment is to put ourselves into best
possible position, if ever the market turns to grab as many opportunities as we can, we
protect the franchise by negotiating with clients that we value. But you've seen in our
report on renewal, basically two markets have caused us difficulties, Middle East which has
started even earlier than this quarter and South Africa where we had certain issues. And
those issues we had in South Africa, the consequence of it is that we reduced our lines,
because we thought that we were not in a position to support the pricing levels. So, in
that case, it's your choice to walk away or to negotiate, reduce your share, keep a
position and then hope for the future.
And so, I think it's client-by-client and market-by-market. But with a clear strategy which is
to position to ourselves with the client we value in such a way, the day the market turns,
whenever it happens, we should be among the very best place to benefit from it.

Q - In-Yong Hwang

{BIO 18784369 <GO>}

Hello. Just two quick questions for me. Firstly, on the Life technical margin. I think there's a
very slight deterioration I think in the technical margin was 7.2%; in the first quarter 7.0%. Is
that just kind of random fluctuation or should we expect that to kind of go down further? I
think, Paolo, you said before that as the share longevity increases, the margin there
should come down gradually.
And my second question is on the floods in China. I think at the end of June, start of July. I
don't think that made into the second quarter cat losses. Just wondering whether you see
that as a major reassurance, given that I think some people are saying it's the worst flood
in 20 years. So, just any comment you can share on that would be helpful. Thank you.

FINAL

A - Paolo de Martin

{BIO 15930577 <GO>}

Yeah. This is something we communicated upfront when we communicated Optimal
Dynamics back in 2013 that we were expecting technical margin to come down at around
7% by the end of (51:21). I think we had some very favorable writing of protection business
that helped us offset the growth on longevity so far. But, as we're going to see now, the
longevity is picking up especially before we wrote at the end of last year. So, the
reduction is the pure effect of the longevity business like growing. As we said in the past,
despite the margin being lower, we're writing at a very healthy ROEs, much above the
group target actually.

Well, it's €40 million. It's distributed across long-tail lines; basically, Motor NonProportional, Aviation, Liability and Inherent Defect Insurance. I would say almost equally
between the four lines and it relates to underwriting years that are either old for the

{BIO 18747770 <GO>}

Regarding the decision from the Paris administrative court and that's obviously a decision
that (53:59) analysis, the Paris administrative court has established that there was a
(54:06) state aid that was provided to the CCR, and it's exactly what we've been saying
for the past few years. So now, the file will go to the European Commission. The state will
have to notify this state aid. And we're confident that our analysis will prevail.
In that respect, just keep in mind that, for us, it's more a question of principle than a
question of gaining another business. We think that private reinsurers should be able to
do their job in every market and, especially here in France, and that's what's behind the
complaint that we had filed with the Paris administrative court. In a nutshell, we're very
happy with the decision. And now, we're expecting the final decision from the European
Commission.

Yes. Good morning, all. I got two questions for Victor. The first question will be on the €65
million of claims coming from the Canada wildfire. Just wanted to better understand what
has been the main exposure triggering this pretty high number within a SCOR Group
context. And also, if you could mention if you were surprised or there were anything
wrong in terms of exposure or you've been surprised by the magnitude of the losses on
that side.
And the second question would be on the renewals you're pointing (56:08) development
on the alternative solution side. Could you comment (56:12) I would say new opportunities
coming in or what is the type of, I would say, request you're getting from your clients at
this point in time on the Alternative Solutions product? Thank you.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, as far as Fort McMurray, it's in the history of Canada, it's for sure, the most
devastating fire, but it's not the first one. That is the third city that has been badly affected
by fires of the same nature. And there are a lot of studies being done at the moment in
Canada by government bodies regarding the risk of fires, and how to basically make sure
that the building codes and the way of protecting cities against fire is getting improved.
So, I think this is something that is really considered, not only by us, by our clients, but also
by the Canadian government, and there is even scoring of cities that are being
developed at the moment in order to try to assess the risk.
So, whether it was a surprise or not, but it took quite a bit of time because, as you saw,
the fire developed over several weeks and the flow of information was quite slow. I think
we have a pretty good grasp at the moment of where we are. Most of the loss, almost
the entire loss is coming from our Treaty business in Canada with local companies. Again,
not surprisingly, I think, fortunately our business solution business on Synthetic Fuel in
particular in the Fort McMurray area doesn't seem to be producing heavy losses, at least
at the moment on the BI side, in particular. Contingent business interruption, we do not
seem to have worried too much about that. So, that's where we are.
Regarding Alternative Solutions, I think it's a combination of three things. It's a
combination of, first, companies that have gone through capital studies, whether driven
by Solvency II or around Solvency II. And through those studies, we believe that they can
improve basically their capital situation. So, that's the first. And those are almost
prospective studies, you enter into the study and you try to analyze and propose. Well,
the second is companies that are affected by capital events. It can be because of their
operations. It can be because of the regulations in the countries where they operate. So,
that's the second, capital events that are specific to certain companies.
And there are capital events that are not specific to certain companies, but that are
created by transition regulations in certain countries. And, we are – well, in that case, you
can be approached by several clients, I think, basically the same issue to deal with. So, it's
a variety of approaches. It's mainly EMEA and when I say EMEA, it's Europe plus certain
sophisticated market outside Europe within the EMEA region.

Hi. Good morning, everyone. Just two quick questions from my side, the first being, can
you please provide your individual loss estimates for the Ecuador earthquake and the Sri
Lankan plants?
And, secondly, if I look at the pricing trend for the non-proportional business, the one that
you've reported for this particular July renewals is down 1.7 percentage pricing (01:00:39)
versus minus 5 percentage July last year. So, can you just provide some color as to which
particular geographies or which particular business lines are contributing to the Y-o-Y
improvement? Thank you.

Q - Vikram Gandhi

{BIO 18019785 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

And then the pricing, I think, the most – probably, the most marked difference is U.S. Cat
business definitely. That's where the price decline has slowed down most. And, I mean,
again, I mean June, July renewal is a very specific renewal. It's a lot of U.S., it's a bit of
Europe, and it's almost nothing in Asia-Pac, I mean Asia-Pac, is a bit of Australia and a bit
of Malaysia but Asia-Pac is really very small.

Page 20 of 22



Company N ame: SCOR SE

So, out of the €500 million that we had to renew, a bit less than €100 million was coming
from Europe, then less than €50 million coming from APAC, and all the rest U.S. related.
So, whatever price movement indication, it's very, very weighted on the U.S. side of
course.

your hopes at the start of the year? Thank you.

A - Victor Peignet

{BIO 6287211 <GO>}

I would say it's in line. We are – I would say we are sticking to our plan and we had a plan,
we had a target, profitability, and we are sticking to that. And the amount of portfolio
management, if you look at slide 12, if you look at – you start at the June-July renewal, but
you would look at the previous one, would not be different, you start with almost €500
million. Then, you look at the amount of cancelled premium and you look at the negative
amount within the restructured and you can see portfolio changes. I think that, even
though in the cancelled there are some cancellation, which are basically cancellation by my
clients, but not many clients reshuffling their programs. So, I think though I would say it's
certainly not better than what we expected, but I mean we managed to keep the gate
and that's the most important.
