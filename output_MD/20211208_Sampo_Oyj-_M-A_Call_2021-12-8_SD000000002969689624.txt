Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone. Welcome to today’s conference call on the acquisition of RMI
Holdings and Hastings. My name is Sami Taipalus, and I am Head of Investor Relations at
Sampo Group. I’m joined on the call today by Group CEO and President, Torbjörn
Magnusson; Group CFO, Knut Arne Alsaker; and Chief of Strategy, Ricard Wennerklint.
The call will feature a short presentation from Torbjörn followed by Q&A. We have a
maximum of 30 minutes for the call today so please limit yourself two question about the
transaction announced today. A recording of the call will later be available on sampo.com.
With that I hand over to Torbjörn. Please go ahead.

Torbjörn Magnusson
Thank you, Sami. I am please to be able to report that we keep up the good strategic
pace of development from the last 24 months and that we have been able to acquire full
ownership of Hastings Group in a straight-forward transaction with RMI today to RMI, the
only other owner.
I’ve got a few slides to introduce the transaction. We acquired the first 70% of the
company November last year, and in ever respect they have proved as good as expected
or better. They have also kept the underwriting focus strong during the pandemic and not
attempted to go for uncontrolled growth in a period of beneficial change environment.
Our interaction with Hastings management team has in all situations been rapid and
efficient. Thus we have a very positive view on their culture, their performance, the

FINAL

balance sheet, and also the potential for synergies. We reported on identified synergies
so far after Q2 this year and obviously this transaction give us the full value of these
synergies rather than just part of them.
In line with Sampos other strategic developments, we like to reinvest capital in P&C and
simply our group structure. The move, of course simplifies the collaboration within the
group, makes capital allocation more flexible, and makes sure that we can decide
ourselves about any investments, developments, or bolt-ons for acquisition -- for Hastings
in the future.
Then when it comes to the acquisition price we have now purchased all of Hastings at a
price below 13x earnings. The total price per share is 279 pence. The EPS accretion from
this last transaction only is 4%. We see a lot of potential for Hastings for the future, and
they are very well placed to meet the turbulence that could occur next year in the UK
market due to the GIP [ph] reform, and we see that as an opportunity.
With the underwriting discipline underlying all actions in Sampo, the downside is really very
small. Hastings will stay a pure digital market segment insurer in the U.K. where they have
been so very successful in the past decade and they will not venture into other segments
or geographies.

We look forward to developing the company together with Hastings management and to
report back to you on this next year. With that, Sami, we open up for questions.

Questions And Answers
A - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you, Torbjörn. That concludes the presentation. Operator, were ready for Q&A.

Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Blair Stewart from Bank
of America. Please go ahead.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking questions. I’ve got a couple of questions. The
first is you talked I think when you did the last disposal of Nordea shares that you would
continue the buyback program over and above the 750 that you’ve -- that you’ve already
got in place.
So I just wonder what the latest thinking on that is? Does this transaction affectively
absorb the additional buyback capacity that you had? And secondly, now that you’re in the
full swing [ph] of buying in minorities, what does it mean for the top holding? Thank you.

A - Torbjörn Magnusson

There’s basically no inverse [ph] impact from these transactions on the buyback program.
As such, of course we buy -- the transaction we make strategic moves we take are
assessed individually and not in the swing of doing things rational.

FINAL

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Thanks, Torb. And I know you said that the EUR750 million buyback is unaffected, but you
have also said in the past that that will be extended? Is that still the case?

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

Good morning, Blair, Knut here. We still intend to go propose to the board to go to the
AGM with a proposal for a mandate to an authorization to have the option to do a
buyback also next year.
Obviously just the simple answer to your question that we do spend EUR800 million on
this transaction, so it’s naturally consider that any buyback we will do of our excess capital
will be EUR800 million smaller. However obviously the BDPS [ph] accretion from this
transaction is compensating whatever will come from a buyback of a somewhat larger
size without this transaction.

Q - Blair Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Yes. Okay thanks clear. Thanks, Knut.

Operator
And the next question comes from the line of Will Hardcastle from UBS. Please go ahead.

Q - Will Hardcastle

{BIO 22230376 <GO>}

Yes. Thanks for the question -- thanks for the time. I guess really a different one is what
changed that was initially designed the relationship [ph]? Relying on both to obtain
benefits [ph]? Then the second one, are you saying essentially that the maximum level of
synergies have not changed, its just you’re taking a greater share? Or is there further
optionality now to obtain greater synergies?
Thanks.

A - Torbjörn Magnusson
We couldn’t hear your first question. But on the synergies, we -- today we only say that
obviously we will receive 100% of the synergies to the Sampo Group, and that’s the only
change. But it will of course be easier, we will be more flexible in the discussions going
forward, identifying new synergies and implementing them.
Could you repeat the first question, please?

Q - Will Hardcastle

{BIO 22230376 <GO>}

Yes, absolutely. It’s really just what’s changed versus the initial desiring of a relationship
with RMI to both obtain benefits? So you were very pleased initially with working together,
I guess what’s changed in the meantime?

FINAL

A - Torbjörn Magnusson
Well we have always said that we would like to own 100% of the company, and then
opportunity arose where that could happen. So that’s the only thing that changed. We had
an arrangement initially for a long relationship but one that had an endpoint. Now that we
were able to bring that endpoint forward quite a bit, so that was only positive.

Q - Will Hardcastle

{BIO 22230376 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks.

Operator
And the next question comes from Marco Zolaudi [ph] from Jefferies. Please go ahead.

Q - Unidentified Participant

Bloomberg Transcript

Good morning, everybody. I had a quick question please again on the synergies piece. At
half year you talked about synergies from capital management including reinsurance
optimization and until the financing of Hastings debt in the revolver.
Were those synergies perhaps not fully available whilst you didn't own 100% of the
group? And would they now be more easily achievable now that you do own 100% of
Hastings? I'm thinking particular, of course around debt instruments at Hastings, now that
you have a 100% control are you able to capitalize the Hastings business as you would
wish to without the interference of minorities? Thank you.

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

Good morning, Marco [ph], its Knut Arne here. We don't denounce any new synergies this
morning as Torbjorn just said. But needless to say to have 100% ownership doesn't make
it more difficult to both realize capital synergies and look for capital optimization across
the sample group going forward.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Thank you. I was just (inaudible), so good use of words. But I'm just wondering, would
there been any impediments by having a minority holder to exact some of those
synergies that are now removed?

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

No. I can't say that. But obviously we would, going forward, be totally free to optimize the
capital and capital allocation across the group and also the way that the obviously capital
requirements were calculated in any part of the sample group.

FINAL

Maybe this discussion is a bit unnecessarily implicit. I mean if we were to want to do
something that would cause synergies in Sampo Group, it is much easier if we don’t have
to take that to a board with an external party with a strong ownership in that entity. And
that hones for any activity or system or process.
Then to Knut Arne's point, capital same thing. If we were to find something, let's say a
home insurance portfolio in the U.K. that we would like to acquire and that we don't have
to ask another buyer to support that with capital process, it's going to be much easier.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Indeed. Thank you very much for the conversation.

Barely [ph] made EBIT [ph].

Q - Unidentified Participant

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Thank you.

Operator
(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Fiser McKonnie from
HSBC. Please go ahead.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Good morning, I have some very simple questions. So one, does this change the policy
around upstream dividends with Hastings? Secondly, when I look at the -- you provided
guidance in terms of how this compares to the deal versus our consensus is (inaudible)
but when I look at the operating ratio the consensus has it's well below your target range.
So is it the case that if we were to apply to your target range that the deal is probably not
as valuation sort of friendly? Would that be a fair statement?
And the -- and finally, on one of your slides for half-year [ph] you mentioned the rerating
effect and compare Hastings versus (inaudible) but when you look at the price of the
(inaudible) and direct line over the past year how does that still compare in your mind
given where it's peers are trading at right now? Thank you.

A - Torbjörn Magnusson
One, two, three.

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

FINAL

All right, I'll take the dividend. There's no material change to our thinking around
upstreaming on dividend from Hastings. We're comfortable, obviously with reinvesting
some of the profit that Hastings can rate in the business to grow that business going
forward.
And they have relayed [ph] that profit of -- on Hastings balance sheet to do so. So no
material plans to significantly change Hastings current dividend setup.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Okay. Thank you.

A - Torbjörn Magnusson
And on the peer review, if you look at the same [ph] and direct line I don’t think they are
really peers to Hastings, those are very different businesses. So I don’t really see their
evaluation as a good comparison to this one. And well, obviously being the company
that’s closer to Hastings in the type of business that they write.

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And if I were to take -- I think you asked about the EPS equation and consensus -- we used
consensus numbers, we haven’t guided specifically for a decimal on Hastings profit. I don’t
think there would be a material difference in the numbers we published this morning,
whatever set of numbers we were basing that conclusion on.
The EPS equation from Hastings is at least as high as for share buyback. Then, of course it
would always also -- you also need to make some assumption about where the Sampo
share price would be going given our ongoing buyback program. And we haven’t made
any such assumption, just used current share prices.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Okay. Thank you very much.

Operator
And we have one more question from Triffon Aspira [ph] from Berenberg. Please go
ahead.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Hi, morning, everyone. I just had a question around capital. Would only 100% of Hastings
allow you to eventually move to a group partial intel model and benefit from capital
comment [ph] (inaudible)? Could there be more synergies on this copy potentially looking
at take the remaining minorities up from the market [ph] (inaudible). Thank you?

A - Torbjörn Magnusson
This is not -- this is probably the most difficult Q&A that we've ever had because the
sound quality is a bit difficult. Just, Knut, I think you got the question.

FINAL

A - Knut Arne Alsaker

{BIO 18730318 <GO>}

I think I got the question, thanks for the question. We -- in our business case around
Hastings, we haven’t concluded anything around an internal model for Hastings.
Obviously as we now our P&C group and when we own 100% of PMC business is that it is
clearly easier to manage capital across the group and calculate capital requirements on a
Sampo Group level according to mobile [ph] which we find appropriate. But an internal
model for Hastings capital requirement you shouldn’t expect this is happening overnight
so to speak.
But the governance that we know we have with Hastings makes it easier to have such
thoughts since an internal model is more than just a technical instrument. It’s also the use
test and governance structure that we have around the business.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Thank you, very clear.
