{BIO 15243791 <GO>}

Thank you, Kathryn. Good morning. Welcome to our call to discuss Fairfax's 2012 year-end
results. This call may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ,
perhaps materially, from those contained in such forward-looking statements as a result
of a variety of uncertainties and risk factors, the most foreseeable of which are set out
under Risk Factors in our base shelf prospectus filed with Canadian securities regulators.
I now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Prem Watsa.

Thank you, Paul. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Fairfax 's year-end
conference call. I plan to give you the highlights and then pass it on to Dave Bonham, our
CFO, for additional financial results.
Our book value per share increased by about 6.5% in 2012, to $378.10 per share, from
$364.55 a share at the end of December, 2011, after we adjust for the $10.00 per share
dividend that we paid in the First Quarter of 2012. We returned to profitable underwriting
in 2012, notwithstanding $261 million losses from Hurricane Sandy, and $410 million in total
catastrophe losses -- the fourth worst year for catastrophe losses that we have
experienced in our history. OdysseyRe, in spite of Hurricane Sandy, had outstanding
results, as its combined ratio was the lowest in its history at 88.5%. Fairfax Asia continues
to do very well. And Northbridge, Crum & Forster, and Zenith are recovering very well
from the soft markets of the past, showing underwriting discipline with good reserving.

Bloomberg Transcript

For you, our shareholders, the most important point to recognize is that in 2012 our
insurance and reinsurance businesses continued to expand after being in a downturn for
the four years prior to last year. In 2012, including the acquisitions we made, net premiums
written at Fairfax grew by 9.2%. Excluding acquisitions, which are First Mercury and Pacific
Berhad in Malaysia, net premiums written grew by 7.4%. At the subsidiary level, net
premiums written in 2012 grew as follows -- Zenith, plus 20.4%; Crum & Forster, plus
16.4%; OdysseyRe, plus 15%; Fairfax Asia, plus 12.6%; and Northbridge, in Canadian
dollars, was down 6%.
The continued Catastrophe launches in 2012 -- which, by the way, Sandy was one of the
largest catastrophes experienced in the United States -- very low interest rates and the
potential lack of future reserve redundancies means there is no place to hide for the
industry. Combined ratios have to drop well below 100% for the industry to make singledigit returns on equity with these low interest rates.
In the Investment area, net investment gains of $643 million for the year 2012 consisted of
the following -- please note page two of our press release -- net gains on equity and
equity-related investments of $1.12 billion, consisting of $470 million realized and $649
million unrealized gains, were reduced by net unrealized losses of $1.01 billion on our
equity hedges. So our equity hedges were a significant negative for Fairfax in 2012. Net
bond gains of $728 million, and other net losses of $199 million, resulted in a net
investment gain of $643 million in 2012 for Fairfax. In total, we realized $1.07 billion in gains
in 2012, which was offset by $422 million in unrealized losses, for net gains of $643 million.
All of this is shown in the table on page 2.
Like in 2011, we reduced our long US Treasury position significantly at a very large realized
gain. Please note, in 2011 and 2012, we've had total realized gains from stocks and bonds
of $1 billion in each year. We believe that the unrealized losses represent, to a large
extent, only market fluctuations, and if history is any guide, should result in profits over
time.

FINAL

As of December 31, 2012, the Company held $1.17 billion of cash, short-term investments,
and marketable securities at the Holding Company level. Our Company continues to be
soundly financed, with little near-term debt maturities, as we extended the term of our
debt at lower interest rates in 2012 and early 2013 to allow the repurchase of about $230
million of maturing, more expensive debt. Finally, we continue to be approximately fully
hedged at about 100% in relationship to our equity and equity-related securities, which
includes convertible bonds and convertible preferred stock.
We continue to be very concerned about the prospects for the financial markets, and the
economies of North America and Western Europe, accentuated by potential weakness in
China. There appears to be a big disconnect between the financial markets and the
underlying economic fundamentals. On October 12, 2002, the Company completed the
purchase of the run-off business of Brit Insurance Ltd. for $335.1 million, which was almost
fully paid by the Company's run-off subsidiaries. At December 31, 2012, Brit Insurance had
an investment portfolio of $1.2 billion. In October 2012 the purported class-action
commenced in July 2011 against the Company and Others was dismissed with no
payment and without the possibility of further appeal or amendment.
On December 10, 2012 the Company completed the sale of its interest in Cunningham
Lindsey for cash proceeds of $270.6 million. Fairfax invested $34.4 million of the proceeds
in shares of Cunningham Lindsey on closing, to continue to be a 9.1% minority shareholder.
In October 2012, the Company's TIG run-off subsidiary, paid $200 million in full satisfaction
to loan note issued by TIG in connection with its acquisition of General Fidelity in August
2010. On October 15, 2012, the Company completed an offering at par of CAD200
million, of 5.84% notes due 2022, for net proceeds of approximately $199 million. Early
this year, on January 21, 2013, the Company completed an additional $250 million offering
of its 5.84% notes, due 2022, for net proceeds of $258.1 million. These notes were
appraised at $103.854 per $100 principal amount, for an effective yield of 5.326%.
So now I would like to turn it over to Dave, so he can give you some more information on
the underlying financials. Dave?

Dave Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

Thank you, Prem.
First, I'll focus on Fairfax's consolidated results for the Fourth Quarter and the full year of
2012. Then I'll move on to talk a bit about the Operating Company results. And finally, we'll
finish up with the consolidated financial position.
So to the consolidated results -- for the full year of 2012, Fairfax reported net earnings of
$532 million. That compares to $45 million of net earnings in 2011. Fully diluted earnings
per share in 2012 was $22.94 per share. And that compared to a fully diluted loss per
share of only $0.31 per share in 2011. Increased net earnings, year over year, was
principally as a result of a significant improvement of the underwriting profitability of the
Company. And I can elaborate on that a bit more in a moment.

FINAL

For the Fourth Quarter of 2012, Fairfax reported net earnings of $404 million, or $18.90
per share on a fully diluted basis. That compares to the Fourth Quarter of 2011, when we
reported a net loss of $771 million, or $38.40 per share on a fully diluted basis. An increase
in net gains on investments was the primary driver of a year-over-year improvement in our
Fourth Quarter net earnings; and much of what Prem has highlighted relative to our
Investment performance in the full year of 2012 was also applicable to our investment
results in the Fourth Quarter.
Turning to the underwriting results of our insurance and reinsurance operations -- for the
full year of 2012, Fairfax reported a combined ratio of 99.8%, and an underwriting profit of
$12 million. And this was in sharp contrast to the combined ratio of 114.2%, and the
underwriting loss of $754 million that we reported last year. Current-period Catastrophe
losses in 2012 were just over $409 million, and added 7 points to our combined ratio. And
that was largely related to Hurricane Sandy. That compares to just over $1 billion of
Catastrophe losses incurred in 2011, primarily comprised of the Japanese earthquake and
the Thailand floods. And that added 19 points to the combined ratio in that year.

Bloomberg Transcript

In terms of reserve development, in the full year of 2012, we experienced $177 million of
net favorable development to prior-year reserves, and that benefited our 2012 combined
ratio by 3 points. In 2011, net favorable emergence on prior-year claims reserves was $89
million, and that was a 1.7 benefited the 2011 combined ratio. Our accident year combined
ratio in the full year of 2012 was 102.8%. And that compares to 115.9% in 2011. Excluding
current-period Catastrophe losses, our accident year combined ratio was 95.8%,
representing a near 1 point improvement over the 2011 accident year combined ratio of
96.6%.
Now, turning to our Operating Company results -- we'll start with OdysseyRe. In the Fourth
Quarter of 2012, OdysseyRe earned an underwriting profit of $34 million, despite the
impact of Hurricane Sandy losses, which were about $175 million, net of reinstatement
premiums. Odyssey's combined ratio of 94.4% in the Fourth Quarter of 2012 included 31
combined ratio points of catastrophe losses. For the full year of 2012, OdysseyRe earned
an underwriting profit of $267 million, and reported a combined ratio of 88.5%,
representing a significant improvement relative to the underwriting loss of $336 million
and combined ratio of 116.7% in 2011. That underwriting loss included $735 million of
catastrophe losses, net of reinstatement premiums.
OdysseyRe's accident year combined ratio was 95.1% for the full year of 2012. And
excluding current year catastrophe losses, that accident year combined ratio was 82.7%.
That compared to the accident year combined ratio of 119.3% in 2011. That ratio included
37 combined ratio points of current-period catastrophe losses, so excluding catastrophes,
Odyssey's accident year combined ratio last year was 82.6%.
In the full year of 2012, OdysseyRe's calendar year combined ratio included the benefit of
6.6 points, or $152 million of net favorable development of prior year's reserves,
principally related to favorable emergence on prior year's Catastrophe losses, and
Casualty and Property losses in the US and Europe. Odyssey wrote $2.4 billion of net
premiums in the full year of 2012, up from just under $2.1 billion in 2011. The increase

Page 4 of 14

FINAL

reflected the impact of a significant new Property quota share contract that incepted in
2012. And also reflected increased writings of US Crop and Umbrella lines of business.
Moving on to Crum & Forster, Crum & Forster incurred underwriting losses of $87 million in
the Fourth Quarter, and $113 million in the full year of 2012. Underwriting losses in 2012
were principally as a result of $21 million of Hurricane Sandy losses in the Fourth Quarter,
and net adverse development to prior year's reserves, $49 million in the Fourth Quarter,
$54 million for the full year of 2012. And that reserve development was principally at First
Mercury. As a result, Crum & Forster's calendar year combined ratio was 109.3% in the full
year of 2012, and that compared to 107.9% in 2011.

Bloomberg Transcript

Excluding the reserve development we just mentioned, Crum & Forster's accident year
combined ratio was 104.9% in the full year of 2012, compared to 104.2% in 2011. Net
premiums written by Crum & Forster in the full year 2012 were slightly in excess of $1.25
billion, compared to $1.1 billion in 2011. Excluding the year-over-year increase in net
premiums that resulted from the consolidation of First Mercury in 2011, net premiums
increased 7.5%, principally reflecting increases in specialty and standard lines of business.
Zenith National reported combined ratios of 114% and 115.6% in the Fourth Quarter and full
year of 2012. And that showed significant improvement over the combined ratios of 132%
and 127% in the same respective periods in 2011. The year-over-year improvement in the
Zenith combined ratio reflected the combination of a decreased expense ratio, as a
result of higher net premiums earned in 2012, and nominal net favorable development to
prior year's reserves in 2012; compared to net adverse development to prior year's
reserves, which added 6.8 points and 4.9 points to the combined ratios in the Fourth
Quarter and full year of 2011, respectively. Net premiums written by Zenith of $619 million
during the full year of 2012 increased year-over-year by 18.2%, reflecting premium rate
increases, strong renewal retention, and the ability to write new business.
Northbridge's combined ratio in the Fourth Quarter of 2012 was 113.7%. And that
compared to 101.9% in the Fourth Quarter of 2011, with the year-over-year increase
primarily the result of $24 million of catastrophe losses, inclusive of reinstatement
premiums, and those were primarily related to Hurricane Sandy. That added 10 points to
the combined ratio in the Fourth Quarter of 2012. The full-year combined ratio for
Northbridge in 2012 was 105.7%, and that compared to 102.8% in 2011.
The accident year combined ratio for Northbridge in the full year of 2012 was 111.8%. That
included 4 combined ratio points of catastrophe losses and an increase in large losses
year over year. The accident year combined ratio in the full year of 2011 was 106.5%, and
that included 2.6 combined ratio points of catastrophe losses. Net premiums written by
Northbridge of $949 million in the full year of 2012 compared to approximately $1.1 billion
in 2011, and decreased by 13.6% when measured in US dollars.
After adjusting for the transfer of the renewal rights to Northbridge's US property book of
business to an affiliate of OdysseyRe in May, 2012, and adjusting for a non-recurring intercompany reinsurance transaction that occurred in 2011, Northbridge's net premium written
for the full year of 2012 decreased by 7.2% when measured in Canadian dollars. And that

FINAL

reflected lower retentions of existing business, partially offset by some modest price
improvements and increased levels of new business in certain segments. The
adjustments that I just mentioned, or I just referred to, and their impact on Northbridge,
are set out on page 48 of our condensed consolidated financial statements for the Fourth
Quarter and full year of 2012 and 2011, which is available on our website.
Fairfax Asia has reported a combined ratio of 84.4% in the Fourth Quarter of 2012. That
represents a modest improvement over the combined ratio of 89.2% in the Fourth
Quarter of 2011. For the full year of 2012, the combined ratio in underwriting profit of
Fairfax Asia was 87% and $30 million, respectively -- or an underwriting profit of $30
million, respectively. That compares to 83% and $34 million in 2011. Net premiums written
by Fairfax Asia increased by 12.6% to $241 million in the full year of 2012, from $214 million
in 2011, and that was principally as a result of increased writings of Property and
Engineering lines of business.

Bloomberg Transcript

The insurance and reinsurance Other division in the full year of 2012 produced a
combined ratio of 104.3% and an underwriting loss of $22 million. That compared to a
combined ratio of 140.9% and an underwriting loss of $207 million in 2011. The significant
improvement in underwriting results there reflected lower catastrophe losses year over
year, partially offset by decreased net favorable developments in prior year's reserves.
In run-off, Prem has highlighted many of the significant transactions that happened in runoff during year. I'll round that out by saying that run-off had another good year, and
reported $191 million of pretax income in the full year of 2012, compared to $360 million in
2011. Our consolidated interest and dividend income decreased year over year to $409
million from $705 million in 2011. Our interest and dividend yield decreased to 1.63% for
the year ended December 31, 2012. That compares to a yield of 3.16% for the year ended
December 31, 2011.
Our average investment portfolio size increased during 2012, primarily as a result of the
acquisition of Brit Insurance. The average portfolio size based on the full year of 2012 was
$25.1 billion. And that compared to $24.4 billion at the end of 2011. We ended the year with
an investment portfolio, which included Holding Company cash and investments, of $26.1
billion.
Moving to our financial position, Prem captured most of the highlights related to that. And
I'll add that our year-end debt to capital ratio decreased to 25.5%, compared to 26.4% in
2011, with the improvement primarily due to increased shareholders' equity, that being the
result of our 2012 net earnings, partially offset by common and preferred share dividends
paid.
And before I pass it back to Prem, I would like to remind everyone that our annual general
meeting will be held on Thursday, April 11, at 9.30 AM at Roy Thomson Hall. The details will
be in the annual report on the last page, which will be published in March 8 in the evening.
So back to you, Prem.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions)
Paul Holden, CIBC.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I just want to ask two questions, if I may. And the first one is related to the trend in cat
losses. Historically, we've normally thought of cat losses as making up 4% to 5% of
premiums earned. Five-year average now is 9.5%. And 7% in the most recent year. Should
we assume it's 4% to 5% going forward? And if that's the case, is it simply because
pricing has made up for the differential? Is pricing adequate now, is my question.

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Are you thinking in terms of our total return, non-capital, or investment returns? Or what
were you thinking about?

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Sorry, I'm thinking about cat losses as a percentage of premiums earned. Is pricing
sufficient now that cat losses going forward should only make up 4% to 5% of premiums
earned?

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Yes. So we look at that right now and those percentages go up and down, as you know.
But we think, because of the recent catastrophe -- so you have had a string of
catastrophes in 2011. And you have had Sandy. Which, if it works out to be $25 billion to
$30 billion -- and we'll only find out later on if that's what the actual cost is, that would be
the second-largest catastrophe in the United States in total dollar amounts. So what that
means is catastrophe pricing remains at very high levels. And we find it attractive. And
subject to our limits, we are writing as much as we can now through OdysseyRe,
particularly. And worldwide -- this is across the world. But over time, those rates will come
down, if we don't have enough catastrophes in the next few years, not enough hurricanes
damage or earthquake damage, that the pricing will be insufficient. But right now, it's
attractive.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. Then second question is related to your equity hedges. And specifically I
want to hone in on your private investments, or your investments in affiliated companies,
as you call it. I want to understand why you're hedging that position from an economic
basis. Obviously there is a mismatch from an accounting basis because you don't mark to
market those investment every quarter. But how do you think about it from a real
economic standpoint in terms of how you're going to extract value from those private
investments? And why you feel you need to hedge the value of those.

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Yes. These private investments, quite a few of them are public. We might have 20% of
the company. Then we have to -- if we have anything about 20% we have to equity
account it. But the underlying stock price is very much prevalent. And so we just think, right
now we continue to be worried about the effects of economic weakness worldwide. And
so we think that this is a good time to be conservative, including our equity positions in
our Associates. Because the underlying -- a lot of the underlying companies that sell
public. We're basically very conservative at this stage.

Q - Paul Holden

{BIO 6328596 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you.

Q - Tom MacKinnon

{BIO 2430137 <GO>}

Just again to ask the question, I asked a similar question the last quarter, but you're
getting underwriting improvement here, certainly from an accident year, excluding cats
basis. But the drag from being 31% invested in cash continues to weigh on your operating
results, if you will. What's it going to take for you, or what signals would you look for in the
market before you'd want to reduce that cash position? Is there anything other than just
you think you're going to wait and get a better return? Or what's driving you to continue
to be 31% invested in cash?

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

That's a very good question, Tom. We've got about 30% cash, a significant amount of
cash in the Company. First of all, as I said in our opening remarks, there's a disconnect
from the financial markets -- and I mean stock and bond markets here -- versus the
underlying fundamentals. What do I mean? Stock markets have gone up very significantly
from the end of 2009. From the March of 2009, the bottom, gone up more than 100%.
And the spreads between corporate bonds and treasuries are now comparable to what
they were prior to 2008. And the economy, even last quarter, in the United States was flat
or down 0.5%. So in spite of QE3, in spite of QE2, QE1, all of that massive stimulus,
monetary stimulus, hasn't had much of an impact on the economy. And so we're just
thinking that it's a time to be conservative.

FINAL

We think what happened in '08, '09, was not like any other economic recession. Tom, we
mentioned a few times, we think this is a 1 in 50, 1 in 100 year storm. So you have to be
prepared for its after effects. We don't think it just lasted for three and six months and so
now we can go forward. This is an opinion, by the way. And we could very much be wrong.
And so, we just feel that way.
As far as the 30% cash, remember, that can change. So in 2008 -- and we had this
position in 2007 and 2006 -- 2008 things turned, the financial markets. The stock markets
dropped during that time about 50%. And so we took our hedge off. And spreads
widened significantly. Like, really huge spreads. In turn, the only people who could benefit
from that were the people who had cash or government bonds. And so we're conscious
of that in our history. Cash gives you options, gives you the ability to take advantage of
opportunity. But you have to be long term. We have built our Company with a long-term
view. Our long-term results are excellent.

Bloomberg Transcript

For example, in 2007, '08 and '09 -- the three years 2007, 2008, 2009 -- we made $2.8
billion after-tax. Our book value went up by 150%. Since that time, we haven't done a lot.
But we've said to our shareholders that we are long-term focused, our results are lumpy,
and we never know when it can change. But the cash gives us a huge advantage in terms
of taking advantage of opportunity as and when they come. At the moment, we don't
think there are many, so we're building cash.
I did say, one last point, that in 2011 and 2012, we've realized -- when I say realized, I mean
we've sold stocks and bonds -- and realized $1 billion in each year. But it's masked by the
mark-to-market accounting which takes the fluctuations and subtracts from that $1 billion.
We think over time those things will work themselves out. So we really think we're in a very
good position, but always with a long-term viewpoint, Tom.

A couple questions, both related to the run-off segment. You added a fairly significant
deal late in the quarter, to do reinsurance for Eagle Star. Could you just give some
background in terms of what type of underlying risks those are? The liability or property,
whatever they might be?

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Yes. Eagle Star, Tom, was another deal that we did late in the year. Our annual report
comes out, Tom, on March 8. And we'll give you a lot more detail, not only, of course, on
our run-off acquisitions, but also on our views on the financial markets. That's the
opportunity to tell you a lot about some of these acquisitions. But one office has done an

FINAL

outstanding job for us. Eagle Star is one. And Brit, as you know, is the big one that we
acquired in 2012. And it's after a significant amount of due diligence.
We've got a team, that's all they do is run-off. They're specialized in run-off. And so we
just think that's a major advantage. There's very few companies that can do this. There's
maybe two or three companies that compete with us. And we have our historical
reputation of striking a deal and never changing it. Subject to due diligence, but never
changing it. Unless we find something different -- and we haven't in 27 years. That is a
huge advantage for us when we do these transactions. But more on Eagle Star in our -Dave, did you want to add to that, perhaps?

A - Dave Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

Yes. Mark, just to your question, that Eagle Star portfolio is largely concentrated in the
London market business. It's got some US casualty business and it's looking at older
claims, 1990 and prior.

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. And Mark, very similar to the businesses that we've done in the past. So we've got
lots of experience. Their Files are very similar to what we've been already administrating.
So there's a huge advantage because many of these books are very similar. And we take
10% participation, or 15% participation, and Eagle Star might be taking comparable
participations on similar accounts. So our people would have a big advantage in knowing
the details on these files.

Okay. Thanks. It sounds like that's a pretty mature book of business. And certainly the runoff unit has done extremely well this year. The other question I had also related to the runoff. When you brought over Brit, closed early in October, there was a little bit of earned
premium and associated loss reserves. Would there be much more of that? Or was that
just the last, final closing gasp of that before it goes fully into run-off ?

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Yes, Dave, do you want to take that?

A - Dave Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

Sure, Mark. When we got that acquisition, there were a few policies that were still in force
when we took it. So we took responsibility for those policies. So those policies are just
going to run off, and that will peter out over the next nine months to 12 months and there
shouldn't be any more premium coming in through there.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

So it should taper down from $30 million -- $30 million was the earned in the Fourth
Quarter -- so it should taper down from there to nothing over the next nine months, give
or take?

FINAL

Mark, on that transaction, one of the key risk factors, from our standpoint, was we
identified reserves that we were not as comfortable with. And so we reinsured them to
Brit, with the idea that we have an option, in 18 months, to commute those results and
bring them back. As we get more familiar with the reserving practices, the reserving claim
files, then we can bring them back. If we so desire. But that reinsurance transaction back
to Brit was a very important component of our due diligence.

Q - Mark Dwelle

{BIO 4211726 <GO>}

That's definitely brought a lot of assets to bear on the balance sheet. And if it's a
successful investment, that should go a long way. So good luck with that one. Those our all
my questions, thanks.

Q - Howard Flinker
Is the difference between premiums written in the income statement --.

Just a little louder, Howard?

Q - Howard Flinker
Is the difference between net premiums written in the income statements, and in that
short table, the run-off ?

A - Dave Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

Can you just elaborate a bit more there, Howard?

Q - Howard Flinker
Yes. In that table where you have divisional premiums written, using the Fourth Quarter,
the premiums written totaled 1399. And in the income statement, the premiums were
1598. I'm talking net premiums.

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

You wanted a reconciliation? Howard, why don't you give Dave a call a little later on and
he'll reconcile that for you.

Q - Howard Flinker
Fair enough. That's my question.

Q - Tim Piechowski

{BIO 16907769 <GO>}

At this point, the Company has outstanding CAD2.6 billion worth of preferreds and
debentures. My question would be, given that Northbridge is continuing to decrease
premiums written, how much of the CAD2.6 billion outstanding you think of as a hedge for
Northbridge and other Canadian operations, versus a short position, given the Canadian
dollar or (inaudible) economies generally?

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Tim, what we basically do with the preferreds, particularly, we are hedging our capital,
which is in excess of $1 billion in Canada. So we have Northbridge with capital -- Dave,
what is Northbridge's capital?

A - Dave Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

Say, about $1.3 billion.

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

$1.3 billion. So we're hedging that $1.3 billion in Canadian dollars because we report in US
dollars, Tim. And so, we're just using that as a hedge so it doesn't impact our financial
statements. Dave, you want to add to that?

A - Dave Bonham

{BIO 15243784 <GO>}

Yes. That's right. The amount of the Canadian dollar debt is more or less now matched to
the net assets of Northbridge in Canadian dollars. So that's the principal component of
the hedge.

Q - Tim Piechowski

{BIO 16907769 <GO>}

Good. Thank you, Tim.

Q - Shazad Okigh
A bit of an open-ended question here for you, maybe following on from Tom. This is
obviously a time where corporate margins are at unseen levels, 70% or 80% above
historic averages. We're still at a very high Shiller PE patio when you look at earnings over
the last ten years. And as you mentioned earlier, lows in corporate bond yields, particularly
junk yields. So margin of safety seems to be very low. But the question for you is, do you
see this carrying on for -- could this potentially carry on for a very long time, given the Fed

printing $1 trillion a year with their open-ended program and very large US deficits? So are
we in a position where this situation could persist for a long time going forward?

FINAL

A - Prem Watsa

{BIO 1433188 <GO>}

Shazad, that's a very good question. And of course, no one knows the answer to that. But
all of the factors that you mentioned are impacting the marketplace. We are going to
discuss this more, Shazad, in the March 8 annual report. And we're also going to discuss it
at our annual meeting. And you're really welcome to come in, ask the question, and we'll
have a nice free discussion.
But really, when this will change, Shazad, really no one knows. Our view is that we have to
be very strong financially, where we don't want to ever be indebted to the kindness of
friends, or the Federal Reserve or the Bank of Canada. We have to be independent. We
have to look after our capital so that under any circumstances we don't need capital. And
so, we're very conscious of the downside. While at the same time looking for opportunity.
And we're finding quite a bit. And we're realizing quite a bit of gains, as I had mentioned
to you. So it's a fine balance and we watch that very carefully everyday.

Q - Shazad Okigh
Thanks.
