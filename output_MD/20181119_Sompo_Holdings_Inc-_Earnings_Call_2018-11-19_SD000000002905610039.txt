Yukinori Kuroda

{BIO 19776286 <GO>}

I'm Kuroda with Sompo Holdings. Thank you very much for joining us despite a busy
schedule to this conference call. I would like to talk about the numbers of FY '18 first half
results and full year forecast, which was disclosed today. And our management will explain
at next week's analyst meeting regarding the aspects of our management strategy.
Please turn to Page 2.
In first half of FY '18, although losses incurred from large domestic natural disasters such
as Typhoon #21 expanded, helped by rebound from the impact of hurricanes in North
America in FY '17, resulting ordinary profit was at JPY 27.8 billion, up by JPY 24 billion. And
the net income was JPY 22.1 billion, up by JPY 21.2 (sic) (20.2) billion.
In light of the recent situations, we revised the full year forecast, which is indicated with
ordinary profit of JPY 237 billion and the net income of JPY 170 billion. As will be explained
later, this is mostly reflecting the impact of domestic disasters and also the adjustment
underwriting for Sompo International. Although not shown on the slide, as was disclosed
today separately, cancellation of all treasury shares was approved today, which amounts
to 10% of total outstanding shares that we have been acquiring for shareholder return.
Please turn to Page 4. This is the first half overview. Positive and negative factors are
shown on the following pages.

Page 5. Underwriting profit for Sompo Japan Nipponkoa was minus JPY 58.4 billion, down
by JPY 86 billion, mainly due to the increase of JPY 121 billion in incurred loss from
domestic natural disasters such as Typhoon #21. Excluding the domestic natural disasters,
profit was positive at JPY 13.4 billion due to large losses staying at around JPY 1.6 billion
for this first half, improving JPY 13.1 billion on a year-on-year basis.
The payment in progress for Typhoon #21 and others was about 15% at the end of
September. But we believe that up to 90% can be paid for the full year. And the full year
performance will benefit from the gain on reversal of catastrophic loss reserve.
Please turn to Page 6.
Investment profit was JPY 65.3 billion, up by JPY 35 billion. Main factors include interest
and dividend income being pushed up by cancellation of funds and absence of
impairment loss from consolidated subsidiaries stock from the previous year.
Please turn to Page 7.

Bloomberg Transcript

Ordinary profit was at JPY 27.8 billion, up by JPY 24 billion year-on-year. And the main
factors include underlying -- underwriting profit, investment profit and also rebound from
the impact of hurricanes in North America, which amounted to JPY 74.5 billion in the
previous year.
Overseas subsidiaries posted negative profit but this is a technical issue. Inclusion of
amortization of intangibles from this term in the local accounting process at Sompo
International. Excluding such noise, the profit was actually up.
Net income is shown on Page eight for your later reference. Please move on to Page 9.
Full year forecast numbers. As I mentioned in the outset, this number was revised from
the beginning of the term. Key points explained on the following pages.
Please turn to Page 10.
Net income was down by JPY 40 billion from the initial forecast. There are 2 main factors
involved. The first factor is impact of domestic natural disasters such as Typhoon #21.
Considering the expected losses, reversal of cat loss reserve, reinstatement of premium
for reinsurance, we reduced the number by JPY 19.1 billion from the beginning of the term
forecast. The second factor is a revision of the performance at Sompo International. The
biggest difference between then and now is a degree of hardening of the market.
Adjustment was made to the premium written in light of the current situation. And also,
although it doesn't impact the revised profit, there was an impact of changes in the fair
value of securities and the bottom line was adjusted by just above JPY 13 billion.

Please turn to Page 15.
This is the overview of Sompo Japan Nipponkoa results. Each line item will be explained in
the following pages.
Please turn to Page 16.
Net premiums written, excluding CALI and household earthquake, increased by 0.2%. Fire
and allied lines was down due to partial transfer of products to Sompo International. And
personal accident was also down partly because of the transfer to other lines. Voluntary
automobile was impacted by the rate reduction in January. Other lines maintained strong,
compensating those other products. And SMEs product showed double-digit growth.
Please turn to Page 17. Written and paid loss ratio. First half was 60.8%, up 2.0% year-onyear mainly due to domestic natural disasters in Fire and Allied lines. Excluding the natural
disaster impact, it was down by 0.9%. For full year, as claims paid for the domestic natural
disasters progresses, we expect an increase of 6.2% year-on-year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Please turn to Page 18 for earned and incurred loss ratio.
Same as written paid loss ratio, it increased due to domestic natural disasters. It increased
to 73.4%, up 12.1 points year-on-year. In the full year, we are projecting 68.5%, up 6.8%
year-on-year. Main reason behind the higher loss ratio is due to the impact from domestic
natural disasters. However, another reason, if I may add, is also because we have
incorporated potential large losses quite conservatively.
Please turn to Page 19. Net expense ratio. Net expense ratio was 33.5%, down 0.3 point
year-on-year. We have been able to control both personnel and nonpersonnel costs well
and its trending according to the plan. There is no significant change to the full year
forecast either.
Please go to Page 20.
Combined ratio, which is the sum of loss ratio and net expense ratio I have just explained.
We are showing the combined ratio excluding domestic natural disasters for your
reference.
Please go to Page 21.
Investment profit. Investment profit in the first half is as I have explained at the beginning
of this meeting. Let me supplement the explanation on the reduction of strategic holding
Page 3 of 14

stocks. We sold actual stocks of JPY 55.2 billion by the end of the first half, thus making a
good progress on the sale against the annual plan of around JPY 100 billion. We are
negotiating with companies where we hold shares and got the agreement for the amount
exceeding the planned amount for this fiscal year. So we are going to continue to watch
the market and there may be a situation where we may end up achieving more than
planned. With the consideration of the current environment, we are assuming JPY 147.5
billion in the full year guidance, which is revised up by JPY 5.3 billion from the projection at
the beginning of the year.
For interest and dividend income, gains on sale of securities and impairment loss on
securities, please take a look at the next page, Page 23. Business forecast for Sompo
Japan Nipponkoa.
Assumptions behind the projection are on Page 24 and the usual data indicators related
to automobile insurance are on Page 25. Please take a look at them later.
Please go to Page 26. Domestic natural disasters, which are the biggest noise out of this
fiscal year. Gross loss incurred in the first half was JPY 302.8 million and net incurred loss
was JPY 147.2 billion. As you can see from this page, more than half of the gross incurred
loss was from the impact of Typhoon 21. In the full year forecast, assuming the loss from
Typhoon 24 in and after October, loss from snow damage during the winter season and
some buffer, net incurred loss is projected to be JPY 175 billion from domestic natural
disasters. This is higher by JPY 127 billion from the initial forecast of JPY 48 billion.

Bloomberg Transcript

Next page is on fund and the reserve for your reference. Please turn to Page 29.
Overseas insurance. Adjusted profit in the first half was JPY 27.1 billion, up JPY 62.4 billion.
Main reason for the increase is rebound from the impact from hurricanes in FY 2017, which
was JPY 57.6 billion after tax.
We revised full year forecast downward to JPY 54 billion from the initial JPY 63 billion.
Main reasons are division of SI's business projection of JPY 6.8 billion and the impact from
Turkish lira, which was JPY 1.9 billion.
Page 30 shows the business result breakdown by region. Page 31 is the business result
breakdown by company. Please take a look at them later on. Let me make additional
explanation on SI on Page 32, the largest vehicle overseas. Numbers shown are all in U.S.
dollars.
Top line in the first half grew mainly driven by insurance business. Incurred loss increased
on the back of policy expansion. But expenses are well-controlled against the top line
growth.
We are receiving questions on the market hardening frequently in the meetings and the
interviews. But hardening is limited to low single digits on the average industry. However,
SI achieved high single-digit rate increase above the market. However, we assumed more

than 10% rate increase at the beginning of the year, as I mentioned in the previous
meeting. So based on the current situation, we adjusted top line growth projection. That's
the main outline for the revision. On the next page, we are showing numerical data of SI.
So please take a look later.
Page 35, Himawari Life. There was a net positive impact from provisioning and the
reversal of policy reserve. But all in all, the business is trending in accordance with their
plan. Ordinary profit was JPY 15.4 billion, up JPY 6.4 billion. Net income was JPY 9.4 billion,
which was up JPY 5.1 billion. We have not changed our full year forecast considering some
costs are second half-heavy.
On the next page, we are showing changing factors of net income of Himawari Life. And
on Page 37, we are showing additional information on the adjusted profit. Please take a
look at them later on. Please go to Page 39.
Nursing Care and health care. Main KPI in this business is occupancy ratio, which is
continuously improving. Net income in the first half was JPY 2.2 billion, up JPY 1.2 billion.
Trend of occupancy ratio is shown on the next page, Page 40. Please turn to Page 42.
ESR. There is no extraordinary change and there is no issue with the soundness of
financials.

Next page is on the breakdown of adjusted capital and risk. Please take a look at them
later on.
Lastly, Page 44. This page is on the groupwide asset portfolio. On the next page onwards,
we included asset portfolio of Sompo Japan Nipponkoa SI and Himawari Life. I would
appreciate if you could take a look at them later on. But there is no noteworthy change.

Questions And Answers
A - Unidentified Speaker
Thank you. We'll move on to Q&A. Mr. Muraki with Deutsche Securities.

Q - Masao Muraki

{BIO 3318668 <GO>}

My first question is about domestic P&C excluding natural disasters. On Page 18 on the
left-hand side, excluding natural disasters, the E&I loss rate was supposed to improve by
0.4% year-on-year, that was the initial plan. But you mentioned that the large losses will be
included conservatively. Have you included the ones that have become more visible?
Would you say that the new plan is more conservative than the first plan in the beginning
of the term?

Company N ame: Sompo H oldings I nc
Company Ticker: 8630 JP Equity
Date: 2018-11-19

Thank you very much for your question, Mr. Muraki. I would like to answer the question
about the E&I loss ratio excluding natural disasters. As you could tell, slight increase is
expected. And as you mentioned, major factor is large losses. As was explained earlier,
up until the first half, we had large loss of JPY 1.6 billion. And as I explained last year,
usually, on average, we see approximately JPY 10 billion to JPY 12 billion large losses. So
that's how much we should assume. But in the previous year, we had a lot of large losses,
JPY 25 billion, which means that this year's forecast is closer to what we had in the
previous term. We have already recognized some of the large losses at billions of yen. We
believe that it will reach the level of the average year so that is why we have added
approximately JPY 10 billion worth of large losses, which is more conservative than the
initial plan. By line, voluntary automotive sees automotive parts unit price increase and
direct revision. So E&I loss ratio is expected to increase by 1% excluding natural disasters.
And in the marine line, although the impact is small, we had some medium-scale disasters
such as Mexico flood and that this why loss ratio is expected to increase.

Q - Masao Muraki

{BIO 3318668 <GO>}

Second question is about Page 33. You have indicated the details of P&L. And I have a
question about this plan. The gross premiums written is lower by 7% compared to the
initial plan. And net premiums written is lower by about 12%. And the reason for this
downward revision, can it be explained by hardening of the market not progressing as
much as you had expected? I understand that you're hiring more underwriting employees
to increase the volume, that was another direction. So rate versus volume, how do you
explain the 7% and the 12% downward revision from these aspects? Now the loss ratio has
remained basically the same from the initial forecast. You have the outlook about the
natural disasters versus others and how have these numbers changed from what you
expected in the beginning of the year?

A - Yukinori Kuroda

{BIO 19776286 <GO>}

Thank you. I would like to explain about SI. With regard to top line, the gross premium
written rate can be affected by the reinsurance. But mostly, this can be explained using
the gross premium written. So let me explain using this number about the downward
revision. In the beginning of the term, you asked a similar question. And I answered that
we expect 34% increase in gross premiums written, which breaks down to 13% due to
integration of Sompo America, 10% organic growth and just above 10%, in fact, 11%, from
market hardening. That's how I explained it. Gross premium written is plus 25% in this
forecast, which breaks down to 13% from integration of Sompo America, which is the
same as before. The remaining 12% increase can be broken down into organic, growth
6%. And market hardening, 6%. Now which means that 5 point impact, negative impact,
for not reaching the expected hardening of the market and also for organic growth, we
underachieved by 4%. Hardening of the market was approximately 1% to 3% -- 1 to 3
points. So we are providing underwriting with a strong awareness about the P&L. But the
initial forecast was maybe too aggressive. Organic growth, we have not really reached the
target. But the P&L standard is very stringent at SI and we have not really achieved that.
Last year, we had seen worsening of losses due to property insurance and we were trying
to remove the low-profit contract. But during the first half, we still have some of those
contracts, that is why we could not achieve the target for organic growth. But P&L and lowprofit contract are controlled very tightly, which means that net losses and loss expenses
can stay lower. With regard to loss ratio, the assumptions have not changed very much
Page 6 of 14

Company N ame: Sompo H oldings I nc

from the beginning of the term. Initial forecast was 60.4% and the new plan is at 60.6%.
So the difference is only 0.2%. Cat budget for SI is JPY 26 billion. Up to the first half, there
was basically no impact. But during the second half, more recently, we had hurricane
Michael, which may exceed JPY 10 billion in terms of losses and there are some smaller
things that would be accumulated. So the total number would be below JPY 26 billion. But
some of that will be consumed. So we decided to maintain the same number for cat, JPY
26 billion. And the loss rate and rate reduction, these were some of the impacts that
resulted in the worsening of 0.2%.

A - Unidentified Speaker
Next questions are from Ms. Tsujino from Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.

Q - Natsumu Tsujino

{BIO 2234779 <GO>}

I have 2 questions. First, with regard to the reversal of natural catastrophe loss reserve
associated with natural disasters, this time, you are assuming net reversal of nat cat loss
reserve of JPY 125.5 billion for Sompo Japan Nipponkoa. And your net reversal
assumption at the beginning of the year was JPY 13 billion. That means loss assumed for
natural disasters at the beginning of the year was around JPY 50 billion. So are you not
assuming extraordinary provisioning to the nat cat loss reserve? Have you calculated on a
regular basis. And as a result you're projecting the reversal of JPY 125.5 billion on the
regular calculation basis without extraordinary provisioning?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Yukinori Kuroda

{BIO 19776286 <GO>}

Let me address your first question first. Yes. In this projection, we are not assuming any
extraordinary provisioning to the nat cat loss reserve. This is on the regular calculation
basis. As you know, when we top up the nat cat loss reserve, there's 5% tax-free
additional provisioning capacity. But we made an additional provisioning already of 14%,
way above 5% tax-free additional provisioning capacity. Is it enough? We are going to
decide whether that's enough considering various factors. But at the moment, we think
we can achieve the targeted balance of the nat cat loss reserve within a few years. So we
are not assuming any extraordinary provisioning to that reserve. But temporarily, the
balance of the nat cat loss reserve will go down. That's the fact. So if necessary, there's a
possibility that we are going to study the additional extraordinary provisioning to the
reserve. But when we do that, there is also a possibility that we may offset that by capital
gains and other factors.

Q - Natsumu Tsujino

{BIO 2234779 <GO>}

Secondly, with regards to the adjusted underwriting profit, net provisioning to the natural
catastrophe loss reserve, incurred natural disasters and foreign exchange fluctuation
reserves, in the first half, there was negative JPY 4.2 billion. You left the full year number
unchanged. So from the beginning of the fiscal year, it's negative for that portion. With
that, adjusted underwriting profit is down by JPY 18.3 billion. I don't think you can explain
this amount only by large losses that you explained earlier. I don't think that's the only
reason. Are there anything else?

A - Yukinori Kuroda

FINAL

The biggest factor is over JPY 10 billion are large loss or large losses. That's the biggest
factor. But also for each product line, we have changed our base views a little bit. So that
we don't get the downside at the end of the year, we made assumptions more
conservative. For example for automobile line, for the premium assumptions, for the
claims assumption, we made them a little bit more conservative. And also compared to
the beginning of the year, EI loss ratio is now higher by 0.6% compared to the initial
projection. So it's a combination of those factors.

A - Unidentified Speaker
Next, we have Mr. Watanabe with Daiwa Securities.

Q - Kazuki Watanabe

{BIO 15948747 <GO>}

I have 2 questions. First question is about Page 26, domestic natural disasters. First half
gross incurred losses JPY 302.8 billion. Out of that, how much was the impact by the
corporate? And next year, I understand that you're going to increase the rate for Fire and
Allied in retail. What is your policy for the corporate? That's my first question.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Yukinori Kuroda

{BIO 19776286 <GO>}

First half gross incurred losses was approximately JPY 300 billion. And very roughly
speaking, 20% is from corporate. As far as rate increase is concerned, in 2019 January,
two months from now, we plan to revise the rate for Fire and Allied. Base increase of 1%
to 2% will be implemented. And as you may know, advisory rate went up in May 2018,
which usually is applied to the actual rates within 12 to 18 months. So as was reported, the
rate may be revised around autumn 2019 timeframe. Do we do it to the advisory rate
level or are we going to do more? We have not decided yet. But at any rate, our policy is
to achieve that profitability in Fire and Allied. If the retail model changes, then the
corporate model will have to be reconsidered, which means that reasonably speaking, we
should conclude that the base rate for corporate should be increased. We don't know
when. But general direction is for the increase of the rates.

Q - Kazuki Watanabe

{BIO 15948747 <GO>}

Second question about shareholder returns. So the revised profit plan is JPY 105 billion
and the 50% of that is JPY 52.5 billion, which is probably the pool for the shareholder
return. If JPY 50 billion is used for dividends, the budget for share buyback is very small.
Do you have any plan to change this policy for this year?

A - Yukinori Kuroda

{BIO 19776286 <GO>}

Thank you for your question. Regarding shareholder return, we are trying to achieve 50%
of the adjusted consolidated profit for the midterm. And for the last 4 terms, we have
been achieving 50%. So the shareholders can really see strong commitment by the
management to this number. Having said that, in 2013, for example, we had snow
damage. And the adjusted profit was lowered and the total return payout ratio was 220%.
And for this year, we have experienced a lot of temporary damages, which means that
the total return ratio, simply speaking, would be likely exceeding 50%. Now from the
management's perspective, we don't want to be seen as if we have regressed or

Page 8 of 14



Company N ame: Sompo H oldings I nc
Company Ticker: 8630 JP Equity
Date: 2018-11-19

stepped back our shareholder return. And next week, you'll have an opportunity to hear
directly from our management about the strategy and the policy.

Q - Kazuki Watanabe

{BIO 15948747 <GO>}

FINAL

I see. Just to clarify, the total return amount from the previous term can be used as a
benchmark?

A - Yukinori Kuroda

{BIO 19776286 <GO>}

Well we don't plan to step back on our shareholder return. So that may be one of the
factors considered.

A - Unidentified Speaker
Next questions are from Mr. Otsuka from JP Morgan.

Q - Wataru Otsuka

{BIO 16340098 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

My name is Otsuka from JP Morgan. I have 2 questions. First question us about SI. You
have revised your projection of SI business result. You have also changed your forecast for
the hardening a little bit. Is it a timing difference? Meaning, in this fiscal year, it's difficult for
you to increase rates. But in the next fiscal year, you think you can increase the rates? Or
simply, was the forecast at the beginning of the year too bullish? Would you please give
me more color on that? That's my first question.

A - Yukinori Kuroda

{BIO 19776286 <GO>}

Thank you, Mr. Otsuka. First, about the timing difference in the negotiations with the
policyholders, there may be some cases. But in principle, there are not so many such
cases. When this year is closed, then price is set to the -- therefore reflecting the next
year -- next year situation. So answer is our projection at the beginning of the year was
too aggressive. That's mostly only reason. Understood?

Q - Wataru Otsuka

{BIO 16340098 <GO>}

My second question is about Page 9. When I look at consolidated net income of overseas
subsidiaries, also I'm looking at adjusted profit for overseas insurance. Net consolidated
income of overseas subsidiaries, JPY 21.1 billion. And adjusted profit for overseas
insurance is JPY 54 billion. There is quite significant gap between the 2 numbers from the
beginning of the year. You have changed your projection for SI. So would you tell me the
factors contributing to the adjusted profit, which is higher than the consolidated net
income for overseas subsidiaries?

A - Yukinori Kuroda

{BIO 19776286 <GO>}

Thank you, Mr. Otsuka. There is a technical reason. So let me go through. Last year, there
was a profit from the reorganization, as you recall. So because of that, local accounting
was changed a little bit. Up until then, intangible assets such as goodwill was accounted
for on the consolidated basis in Japan. But from this fiscal year, first SI recognizes such
intangible assets first. And then holdings in Japan eliminates once and then recalculates
Page 9 of 14



Company N ame: Sompo H oldings I nc
Company Ticker: 8630 JP Equity
Date: 2018-11-19

the amount that Japan needs to recognize and recognize that amount once again. So
that's the technical reason. And amount of that is on Page 11. At the very bottom on Page
11, the section that no one looks at, there's amount, which is JPY 20 billion. So deducted
that amount and added back that amount.

FINAL

Q - Wataru Otsuka

{BIO 16340098 <GO>}

If that's the case, although the amount is slightly different from the past. But basic thinking
has not changed at all?

Exactly. Basic thinking has not changed.

Next, we have Mr. Niwa from Citi Securities.

Q - Koichi Niwa

{BIO 5032649 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I have a question about your guidance. I'm looking at Page 10. And I may be a little bit
critical. I do understand the details. And I also understand the big impact of natural
disasters. But we have seen the same situation this year and last year, meaning that the
beginning of the year guidance tends to be quite aggressive. So as you formulate your
next midterm plan, how do you deal with the gap between the plan and the actual.
Looking back at what happened in the last two years, how do you see this? And also, how
do you plan to communicate the numbers for the new midterm plan?

A - Yukinori Kuroda

{BIO 19776286 <GO>}

Thank you for your question. The forecast that we're presenting this time is quite
conservative, as you can see, because we are learning from this experience. Basically, in
the beginning of the term, we try to find the most reasonable set of numbers. So it may
be slightly aggressive or conservative. But our basic stance is always the same. We try to
provide the most appropriate numbers at that time. Last year and this year, the biggest
gap came from natural disasters. So we really need to look at year-end and really
consider where the right level should be and reflect those numbers in our plan. But our
responsibility is to indicate the numbers that we believe are reasonable at that time.

Next questions are from Mr. Sasaki from Merrill Lynch Japan Securities.

Q - Futoshi Sasaki

{BIO 17564798 <GO>}

I have 2 questions. My name is Sasaki from Merrill Lynch Japan Securities. My first question
is about the guidance for this fiscal year. As I recall, you gave me the number of the
assumption for the natural disasters overseas, which was JPY 28 billion as I remember.
And you left the number unchanged. So is JPY 28 billion still a good number? That's my
first question. Second question, this time, there was higher frequency of natural disasters
in Japan. But in the next fiscal year onwards, are there any impacts to continue in the next
Page 10 of 14



Company N ame: Sompo H oldings I nc
Company Ticker: 8630 JP Equity
Date: 2018-11-19

fiscal year onward? For example, potential rise of the reinsurance cost? Are there any
lingering impacts from the higher frequency of natural disasters in Japan in the next fiscal
year onward, if any? So that's my second question.

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

A - Yukinori Kuroda

{BIO 19776286 <GO>}

Mr. Sasaki, thank you so much. First, about overseas natural catastrophe budget, you are
right, JPY 28 billion. That's the total amount of overseas natural catastrophes budget,
including the amount underwritten by Sompo Japan Nipponkoa is on the group basis. So
basically, Sompo Japan Nipponkoa and SI altogether, specifically, JPY 2 billion underwritten
by Sompo Japan Nipponkoa, JPY 26 billion underwritten by SI. That's the budget for
overseas natural catastrophes at the beginning of this fiscal year. And for that, yes, JPY 28
billion still a good number. We have not changed. Your second question, are there any
factors to continue in terms of the impact from the higher natural catastrophe this fiscal
year? In the future, as we mentioned about the reinsurance cost, we cannot assume
softening of the reinsurance premiums. But how much will that impact be? Currently, we
are studying the potential impact. But reinsurance programs are quite complex. It's a
combination of various complex reinsurance structures and it depends on where we
assume the attachment point. So there is no straightforward way of calculating how much
% increase of reinsurance cost because those is increased by how much %. Our policy is
to contain the impact from the natural catastrophes so that it does not become the
capital event. At the same time, our policy is also to control the profit volatility impact on
income statement. So based upon those policies at the reasonable reinsurance premium,
we are trying to structure the scheme of reinsurance towards a renewal timing on April 1.
But when we -- when reinsurance proceeds increased, we may offset by pricing increase
of (Fire and Allied) and so forth. So at the moment, we are not assuming any significant
factor that may continue in the next fiscal year onward.

Q - Futoshi Sasaki

{BIO 17564798 <GO>}

If that's the case, is your company trying to reduce the retention going forward? Does the
management think that retention should be lower in the future? Or it has nothing to do
with the higher frequency in this fiscal year and you are not going to change the retention
amount?

A - Yukinori Kuroda

{BIO 19776286 <GO>}

At the moment, it's difficult to say. It's hard to say at the moment for the same -- simply
for the same risk amount. Of course, cost gets cheaper if you lower the retention. So
depending upon other cost control, there is a possibility that we may change the
retention amount. But as I mentioned earlier, basically, we control the reinsurance
programs so that it does not become the capital event. At the same time, we like to
control the volatility because that shareholders and the long-term shareholders request
us to control the volatility as much as we can. So that's how we are trying to structure the
reinsurance programs.

FINAL

Q - Koki Sato

{BIO 19983862 <GO>}

I have a couple of questions. The first one has to do with the catastrophic reserve. For Fire
and Allied, you had JPY 150 billion. And there was a reversal of JPY 100 billion. And you
mentioned that you don't consider extraordinary provision. And it doesn't make sense to
me. You spoke about additional provisions, even at 14%, reversal exceeds the provision.
Simply speaking, it seems that the balance is too low. And looking at the current
circumstances, Sumitomo Mitsui decided to go ahead with the extraordinary provisioning.
How did you decide that it was not necessary?

A - Yukinori Kuroda

{BIO 19776286 <GO>}

Let me try to clarify. We have not decided that extraordinary provision is not necessary.
We have already implemented additional provisioning. And looking at the past several
years, we have seen some reversals. So the balance is not very high. That is the current
situation. And if we land according to the plan, for Fire and Allied, provision will be
approximately JPY 52.6 billion. Is it sufficient? If it turns out to be too small, then we will cut
balance of different factors and still have the option of implementing extraordinary
provision.

Q - Koki Sato

{BIO 19983862 <GO>}

So currently, you have to consider many factors and cannot decide whether the balance is
too low at this point?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Yukinori Kuroda

{BIO 19776286 <GO>}

That is correct. Company looks at economic values. And we do not see any issues with
our ESR, management decision-making or shareholder return policy. For catastrophic
reserve and J-GAAP profitability leveling, this provision is very useful. But how much
balance do we need in order to enjoy this benefit? We have to look at this holistically.

Q - Koki Sato

{BIO 19983862 <GO>}

I understand. My second question is about the cancellation of treasury shares. In previous
meetings, you have explained that cancellation would not be necessary. How did you
decide to do this, this time around?

A - Yukinori Kuroda

{BIO 19776286 <GO>}

Thank you for your question. As far as cancellation of shares are concerned, we have
indicated that there is no advantage or disadvantage for us as a group. And we had no
intention of releasing these shares either. So we just kept them as they were. But the
buyback decided in May would put the level beyond 10% of outstanding shares, which
means that outside directors and shareholders began noticing this. And we had more
opportunities to exchange opinions and that led to this decision. We have governance, of
course. So we canceled these shares. And if necessary, we can do more programs. We
don't have any specific threshold. But we look at the share prices. And we do the buyback
and cancellation. We have established a cycle to be able to do this.

Next question is from Ms. Tsujino from Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.

Q - Natsumu Tsujino

{BIO 2234779 <GO>}

FINAL

I have one question. I'm on Page 9, slide 9. Below the consolidated net income line,
there's a line of consolidated adjustment and others for FY 2018. The negative
adjustment became larger by JPY 9.5 billion from the beginning of the year. What is it?

A - Yukinori Kuroda

{BIO 19776286 <GO>}

This is just as an example. As we talked about earlier, there are intangible assets such as
capital gains on losses that SI recognizes and Japan cancels or eliminates. When we do
that, there's always a difference of the amount. And also for other companies not written
here, not a large amount. But for example, a direct line company, nursing care company,
we made small adjustments for those companies as well. And other than that, the
reasons are all technical.

Q - Natsumu Tsujino

{BIO 2234779 <GO>}

Excuse me, about the amortization of intangible assets. From this time, SI recognizes
amortization and the Japan cancels. Isn't that the positive impact from that item?

A - Yukinori Kuroda

{BIO 19776286 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes.

Q - Natsumu Tsujino

{BIO 2234779 <GO>}

Why is the negative adjustment becoming larger, even though that particular item is
positive adjustment?

A - Yukinori Kuroda

{BIO 19776286 <GO>}

The amount that they recognize and the amount that Japan cancels are different. And
also, we recalculate the amount that Japan needs to recognize on J-GAAP. And for the
cancellation, the cancellation is not for the whole amount. So there's always a difference.
It's extremely technical. So if necessary, I can explain in more details offline to you later on.
That's the main reason.

Q - Natsumu Tsujino

{BIO 2234779 <GO>}

However, for other subsidiaries, the negative adjustment became bigger. Am I right?

A - Yukinori Kuroda

{BIO 19776286 <GO>}

Yes. There are several few hundreds of million yen item for other small subsidiaries.
