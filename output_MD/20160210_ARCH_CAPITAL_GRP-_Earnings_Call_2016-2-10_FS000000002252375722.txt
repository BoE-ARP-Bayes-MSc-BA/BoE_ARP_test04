I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Dinos Iordanou. You
may begin.

Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Thank you, Abigail. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We would
like to begin our call by first welcoming Marc Grandisson who has joined us this morning,
and he will be part of our future presentations to you.
For those of you who may have missed our recent release announcing Marc's promotion
to President and Chief Operating Officer, let me remind you that all of our operating
businesses now report directly to Marc. Many of you already know him as he was an
integral part of the original reinsurance team with Paul Ingrey and others that helped
establish Arch Reinsurance Group as the best-in-class global reinsurer.

Bloomberg Transcript

In addition, Marc played a prominent role in establishing a mortgage business which has
become a significant contributor to our group results. You will hear more about the
business environment from Marc in a few minutes, but let me very briefly describe how
are the operating conditions in the markets we participate in.
To invoke a bit of a sailing analogy, we're facing headwinds in our reinsurance group,
overcapacity, pressure on ceding commissions, more excess of loss purchasing at
inadequate pricing. So, that describes a bit the reinsurance market conditions.
We see reasonably calm conditions in our insurance group, some sectors under pressure
from a pricing point of view, but other sectors offering good opportunities, especially in
small customer segments. And, of course, there is tailwinds in our mortgage segment.
The underwriting is very strong in this particular sector and the macroeconomic conditions
affecting the housing market, they're very favorable.
Turning to our operating results, our fourth quarter earnings were driven by solid reporter
underwriting results, while investment returns were challenging, continue to be affected
by yields available in the market.
Group-wide and on a constant dollar basis, our gross written premium decreased by 3.6%
n the fourth quarter over the same period in 2014, while net written premiums were down
8.2%, as underwriting actions in our insurance and in reinsurance business were only
partially offset by growth in our mortgage business.
We continue, and I know Marc will emphasize this, to emphasize underwriting discipline
with all of our operating units. On an operating basis, we earned $143.6 million or $1.15 per
Page 2 of 31

FINAL

share for the fourth quarter, which produced an annualized return on equity of just shy of
10%; 9.8% for the 2015 fourth quarter. And as it compares to a 9.7% return on average
common equity for the year ending December 31, 2015.
Net income movement on a quarterly basis can be more volatile as these earnings are
influenced by changes in foreign exchange rates and realized gains and losses in our
investment portfolio. Investment volatility during the fourth quarter and for the full-year
2015 caused net income to fall below operating returns. This is, I believe, for the first time
in the last five years that our operating returns were below net income returns.
On a net income basis, Arch earned $4.09 for all of 2015, which equates to a return on
equity of 8.8% for the year. While operating return on equity generally produces a more
stable stream of earnings in the short term, we believe that net income provides a better
view of value creation and book value growth over time.

Bloomberg Transcript

Over the past five years, on average, net income ROE has added 230 basis points to our
operating return. Our reporter underwriting results remain acceptable in the fourth
quarter, as reflected by a strong combined ratio of 86.8%, and were aided by low level of
catastrophe losses and continued favorable loss reserve development. Group-wide, we
believe that, on an expected basis, the present value ROE on the business return in the
2016 underwriting year will produce ROEs in the range of 10% to 12% on allocated capital.
Net investment income per share for the quarter was $0.53 per share, down $0.01
sequentially from the third quarter of 2015. Positive returns on equities in the quarter were
not enough to offset negative returns on fixed income, as the total return on a constant
dollar basis on our investment portfolio was a negative 10 basis points in the fourth
quarter of 2015. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar also impacted total return, which was
a negative 33 basis points for the quarter on a reported basis.
Our operating cash flow, excluding Watford, was approximately $100 million in the fourth
quarter, as compared to approximately $225 million in the same period last year. Mark
Lyons will discuss the changes in cash flow in a few minutes, but approximately one-third
of the decline in cash flow reflects the timing of premiums paid to Watford.
Our book value per common share at December 31, 2015 was $47.95 per share, a slight
increase from the third quarter of 2015 and a 5.2% increase from December 31, 2014.
With respect to capital management, we continue to have capital in excess of our
targeted level. However, we did not find any opportunities to purchase shares in the
fourth quarter that will meet our previously stated criteria for share repurchases.
We have found some of those opportunities to repurchase shares in the first quarter of
2016. Through February 5, 2016, Arch purchased 1.050 million shares under our 10b5
program at a cost of $69 million. With those purchases, we have approximately $450
million remaining on our board authorization. We will review that in our board meeting in
May of 2016.

FINAL

Before I turn over the call to Marc Grandisson, I would like to discuss our PMLs which
continue to decline from underwriting actions we have taken in our cat portfolios. As usual,
I would like to point out that our cat PML aggregates reflect business bound through
January 1, while premium numbers included in our financials are through December 31.
And the PMLs are reflected net of all reinsurance and retrocession we purchase.
As of January 1, 2016, our largest 2050 (sic) [250] (10:16) year PML for a single event
remains the Northeast at $489 million or approximately 8% of common shareholders'
equity. I believe that's the lowest level on a percentage basis in our history. Our Gulf of
Mexico PML decreased to $444 million at January 1 and our Florida Tri-County PML
decreased to a low $362 million.
I will now turn it over to Marc Grandisson to comment on market conditions as he sees
them, before Mark Lyons discusses our financial results. And after Mark Lyons, we will take
the questions. So, Marc, welcome and go at it.

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you, Dinos. It's great to be here. I already know many of you, and I look forward to
know you better as I move into my new role.
As we look across our three segments, insurance, reinsurance and mortgage, we see not
only the challenges of competitive conditions as Dinos has mentioned in stock pricing, but
we also see opportunity in each of our three business segments. While macro events and
the interest rate environment have brought down total ROE expectations to a new normal
level, we are positioning ourselves in all of our underwriting units focusing on specialty
niches that have some inherent competitive protection and for which we believe we will
achieve our 15% ROE target over the cycle.
As far as the overall insurance markets are concerned, commercial pricing remains under
pressure, especially in the more commoditized product lines. Primary P&C rates are
declining in a mid- to low-single-digit range, although there are pockets of restrengthening. Terms and conditions in general are stable.
Turning first to our insurance operations in the United States. We saw a 140-basis-point
effective rate decrease this quarter, but a rate decrease of only 20 bps for the full 2015
policy year versus 2014. Expected ROEs on allocated capital in many lines are still
comfortably in the double digits. Those lines of business include construction, national
account programs, some areas of low capacity, executive assurance and professional
liability. Together, these lines represent over 70% of our 2015 volume.
In contrast, we have seen worsening, as mentioned by Dinos, of the rate levels in
property, also in healthcare and higher capacity executive assurance. As a result, we are
writing less in those lines.
Our insurance group's premium written decreased 2.5% in the fourth quarter 2015 versus
2014 on a gross basis, but 6% down on a net basis. The changes in our gross versus net
Page 4 of 31

FINAL

reflects the change in our underlying mix as well as our ability to buy reinsurance on more
favorable terms. Ceded written premium increased 6.1% in our insurance group this
quarter over the same period last year.
Our international insurance operations, which are based in the UK and underwrites risk
globally, are under heavier pressure from a rate level perspective. Rate changes there
were minus 7% across all of our product lines. Needless to say, we are continuing to
actively underwrite and manage this portfolio and are trying to move into areas such as
accident and health where competition, we believe, is less intense.
Turning to our reinsurance group now. We continue to develop and allocate our resources
to specialty markets and products that are somewhat more shielded from competition.
Business lines such as property, including catastrophe, excess of loss and marine are yet
again experiencing rate declines in the 10% range. At the same time, some segments like
UK motor and U.S. professional liability have experienced small rate increases, and that
has created some opportunities for Arch Re.

Bloomberg Transcript

We find it challenging, if not impossible, to uncover opportunities in a broader U.S.
casualty, global aviation and medical malpractice reinsurance market. The returns there
are just not satisfactory. In our view, capacity is plentiful. In short, the lines of business
where we are focusing our efforts still provide us with expected ROEs on allocated capital
in excess of 10%, but the days of low-hanging fruit are gone.
However, reinsurance group net premium written has declined 26% in the fourth quarter
of 2015 versus fourth quarter of 2014, led by decreased writings in our short-tail
segments. Our property cat portfolio for the full 2015 year is down over 30% over prior
year 2014 on a net basis.
In addition, we have seen and reacted to rate erosion by writing less in many other
product segments such as international credit insurity, workers' comp clash, and French
motor third-party liability business. Cheaper retrocessional protection has also led us to
lower retentions in our reinsurance group on a shorter-tail line.
Switching now to our mortgage insurance segment which includes, to remind you, our
primary operations in the U.S., our mortgage reinsurance on a global basis, as well as the
GSE risk-sharing transaction business. We had another solid quarter of growth in written
premium, growing this quarter by 30% over the third quarter of 2015 and 65% over the
same quarter last year. The growth came mostly from the U.S. GSE risk-sharing program
and from a reinsurance contract with one of the major Australian lenders.
We continue to make progress in the expansion of our U.S. market share. Arch U.S. MI has
approved 904 master policy applications. 460 of these clients have submitted loans to
Arch MI. In addition, we are capturing additional share of the U.S. MI market through our
GSE risk-sharing programs.
At December 31, 2015, our total mortgage segment risk in force is $11.5 billion, which
includes $6.8 billion from our U.S. mortgage insurance operation, $3.5 billion through
Page 5 of 31



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2016-02-10

worldwide reinsurance operations, and approximately $1.2 billion from the GSE risk-sharing
transactions.

FINAL

Our primary U.S. mortgage operation had $2.6 billion of new insurance written during the
fourth quarter of 2015, which was approximately 60% through the bank channel and 40%
via our credit union clients. Our credit union channel continues to perform exceptionally
well, as our bank channel business development efforts gain traction.
Our lender-paid mortgage insurance single net insurance written was only 18% of the total
production, as Arch MI responded to competitive conditions and lower returns as we see
on this business.
Last quarter, we introduced our new risk-based pricing model RateStar and have rate
filings approved in 46 days. Through December 31, 2015, 783 customers have elected to
use RateStar and the technological transition has gone smoothly. We believe that RateStar
enables us to improve our assessment of risk and will help Arch MI create better riskadjusted ROE. We are very pleased with the initial response and the applications that we
are receiving through RateStar at this point.

Bloomberg Transcript

We estimate the overall mortgage markets, NIW, that was down actually for the fourth
quarter versus third quarter by 20%, most of the drop occurring in November and
December as both purchase and mortgage refi volume declined. As one of the newer
player in the mortgage insurance market, we are well positioned to take market share
with our innovative approach to MI and a high credit rating that our diversified business
platform allows.
With that, I will hand it over to Mr. Lyons to cover the detailed financial results.

Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Great. Thank you, Marc, and welcome aboard. It's good to have two Marks and one Dinos,
I think, on the call. So let me just begin by saying what I've said the last few quarters that,
terminology-wise, while I use the term core, I refer to our aggregate results excluding
Watford Re. And when I use the term consolidated, the term is results inclusive of Watford
Re.
Since we're here talking about year-end results, I'd like to take a minute and put our
changing mix of business into perspective. On a full-year net written premium basis, the
insurance segment reduced by approximately 6%, as Marc just mentioned. The
reinsurance segment declined by about 25%. There's an asterisk on that that I'll get to
later. And the mortgage segment increased substantially by 65%.
More importantly though, this results in a mix change on a core basis as follows: The
insurance segment changed from 59% to 61% of total core net written premiums. The
reinsurance segment shrunk from 35% to 31%. And the mortgage segment increased
from 5.7% to 8% of the core net written premium. The mortgage segment's total

Page 6 of 31



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2016-02-10

contribution is actually larger though, since some GSE risk-sharing transaction has received
derivative accounting treatment, and therefore, contributed no net written premium.

FINAL

And as we shall discuss shortly, the mortgage segment in its growth mode combined ratio
on an accident-year basis, which also has an asterisk that I'll get into in a bit, decreased by
530 basis points over that of 2014. So you can see we're growing and shifting in areas of
improved profitability.
Okay. Moving to this quarter's results, the core combined ratio for this quarter was 86.8%
with 1.9 points of current accident year cat-related events, compared to the 2014 fourth
quarter combined ratio of 87.5%, which reflected 2.3 points of cat-related events.
Losses recorded in the fourth quarter from these catastrophic events of this year net of
reinsurance recoverables and reinstatement premiums totaled just shy of $16 million,
primarily stemming from UK storms and other global events emanating mostly within our
reinsurance operations.

Bloomberg Transcript

The 2015 fourth quarter core combined ratio reflects 8.6 points of favorable prior-year
development net of reinsurance and related acquisition expenses, compared to 8.3
points on the same basis in the 2014 fourth quarter. This resulted in 93.5% current core
accident quarter combined ratio excluding cats for the fourth quarter of this year,
compared to an identical 93.5% accident quarter combined ratio in the fourth quarter of
last year.
In the insurance segment, the 2015 accident quarter combined ratio excluding cats was
96.3%, essentially unchanged from the accident quarter combined ratio of 96.4% a year
ago. The reinsurance segment 2015 accident quarter combined ratio ex-cats was 90.1%,
compared to 87.3% in last year's fourth quarter. As noted in prior quarters, the reinsurance
segment's result reflect changes in mix of premium earned, including a much lower
contribution from property catastrophe business, as Marc has alluded to.
The mortgage segment 2015 accident quarter combined ratio was 83.1%, compared to
98.9% for the fourth quarter of 2014. It's important to recall that the concept of accident
year is more of a P&C concept and not directly analogous to the mortgage business due
to their accounting convention. Theirs is much more of a reported year convention.
The full year now, the full accident year 2015 core combined ratio excluding cats was
94.5% versus 94% even for the full 2014 accident year. By segment, insurance group's full
accident year ex-cats was 96.1% versus 96.3% in the 2014 year. And the reinsurance
group's full 2015 accident year was 93.3% versus 90.7% for the 2014 full accident year.
Mortgage segment, on the same basis, was 84.1% versus 89.4% for the full year from
2014. That's the 530 basis points improvement I referenced earlier.
The insurance segment accounts for roughly 14% of the total net favorable development
in the quarter. This was primarily driven by shorter-tailed lines from the 2010 to 2013
accident years and longer-tailed lines from the 2003 to 2011 accident years. The
reinsurance segment accounts for approximately 80% of the total net favorable
Page 7 of 31

FINAL

development in the quarter, excluding associated impacts of acquisition expenses, with
approximately half of that due to net favorable development on short-tailed lines
concentrated in the more recent underwriting years and the remaining half due to net
favorable development on longer-tailed lines primarily from the 2005 to 2011 underwriting
years.
The mortgage segment accounted for roughly 6% of the net favorable development this
quarter, which translated to an 8.1% beneficial impact on the loss ratio, resulting from
continued lower claim rates from the CMG business we acquired in 2014, along with
excellent credit experience to-date on business written since the acquisition.
Some of this favorable development is offset by the contingent consideration earn-out
mechanism negotiated within the purchase agreement. This contingent consideration
impact, however, in a geography sense is reflected in realized gains and losses and not
within underwriting income.
Our core operations across the full 2015 calendar year experienced $272 million of net
favorable development, again, net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums and
related acquisition expenses which represent 8.2 combined ratio points, versus $307
million on the same basis in 2014 which represented 8.8 combined ratio points.

Bloomberg Transcript

The full calendar year net favorable development was approximately 15% in the insurance
segment, 80% in the reinsurance segment, and 5% in the mortgage segment.
Approximately 68% of our core $7 billion of total net reserves for losses and loss
adjustment expenses are IBNR and additional case reserves, which continues to be
consistent across the insurance and reinsurance segments.
The core expense ratio for the fourth quarter of this year was 35.6% versus the prior
year's comparative quarter of 34.7%, driven by the U.S. mortgage insurance operations
which is operating at a higher expense ratio until this business hits a steady state, as well
as the effect of an overall 5.2% smaller core net earned premium base quarter-overquarter.
The insurance segment maintained a 32.4% expense ratio for the quarter, compared to
an identical 32.4% ratio a year ago, reflecting a lower net acquisition ratio offset by an
increasing operating expense ratio. However, we continue to focus on the total expense
ratio, as mentioned in previous calls, since the slotting of costs and benefits within the net
acquisition and operating expense ratios is somewhat artificial, and ceding commissions
booked are wholly booked in the net acquisition line and not allocated to every operating
expense category that they represent.
The reinsurance segment expense ratio increased from 32.5% in the fourth quarter of last
year to 36% this quarter, primarily reflecting a 14% lower net earned premium base. The
reinsurance segment expense ratio was also weighted, though, by a reimbursement
reflecting a favorable tax ruling affecting federal excise taxes.

FINAL

The ratio of net premium to gross premium for our core operations in the quarter was
71.6% versus 75% a year ago. The insurance segment had a lower 66.4% of ratio
compared to 69.18% a year earlier, driven by increased sessions on a larger alternative
markets book that we've commented on in the past, increased sessions on capacitydriven product lines and a reduction in our P&C program business which is kept
predominantly net.
It is important to note that, on a written basis, the front-end gross commission ratio
decreased by 110 basis points and the average quarter share commission ratio improved
by 260 basis points in the U.S. operation. These joint improvements will continue to be felt
as they are earned over the next few quarters.
In the reinsurance segment, the net-to-gross ratio was 76.2% in the quarter compared to
85.5% a year ago, primarily reflecting sessions to Watford Re. Also, as commented on
during the last quarter's call, last year's fourth quarter call, there was a one-time $50.2
million unearned premium reserve transfer associated with Gulf Re, which
correspondently required a $50.2 million written premium to be recorded as well.

Bloomberg Transcript

This distorts the quarter-over-quarter comparison and can be seen in the financial
supplement within the property other than property cat line of business. Adjusting for this,
our unearned premium reserve distortion results in the net written premiums for the total
reinsurance segment this quarter declining by 8.7% quarter-over-quarter.
The mortgage segment, in addition to the premium growth that Marc mentioned earlier,
had approximately $3.5 million of other underwriting income in the quarter from risksharing transactions receiving derivative accounting treatment and $4.6 million of
underwriting profit associated with risk-sharing transactions receiving insurance accounting
treatment. Over time, it is expected that more income will emanate from transactions
receiving insurance accounting treatment than derivative accounting treatment.
The other segment being wholly Watford Re at this point reported a 103.8% combined
ratio for the quarter, $96.2 million of net written premium and $119 million of net earned
premium. As a reminder, these premiums reflect 100% of the business assumed rather
than simply Arch's approximate 11% common share interest.
As for business sourcing, approximately 37% of the gross written premium this quarter
was written directly on Watford paper, with the remainder ceded by Arch affiliates. It
should be noted that the sourcing can vary materially quarter-by-quarter.
The total return on our investment business portfolio on a local currency basis was a
reported negative 10 bps in the quarter, as Dinos mentioned, reflecting positive returns of
our equity sector that were more than offset by negative returns in both investmentgrade and non-investment-grade fixed income as well as the alternative investment
portfolio. Even with our shift into a greater equity and alternative allocation over time,
80% of the portfolio was still comprised of fixed income securities.

FINAL

On a U.S. dollar basis, total return for the quarter was a negative 33 bps. On a full 2015
calendar year basis, total return on a local currency basis was a positive 162 bps. And on a
U.S. dollar basis, the return was a positive 41 bps for the year, led by the equity and
investment-grade fixed income sectors.
The embedded pre-tax book yield before expenses was 2.16% as of year-end, and
duration remained fairly consistent at 3.43 years. Fixed income duration, as we've said in
the past, can fluctuate due to tactical decisions as opposed to long-term strategic shifts.
And the current duration continues to reflect our conservative position on interest rates in
the current yield environment.
Reported net investment income in the quarter was $67 million or $0.53 per share, versus
$67.3 million in the 2015 third quarter or $0.54 per share, and $72 million or 56% share in
the fourth quarter a year ago. As always, we evaluate investment performance on a total
return basis and not merely by the geography of net investment income.

Bloomberg Transcript

Core cash flow from operations, as Dinos mentioned, was approximately $100 million in
the quarter versus $227 million in the fourth quarter of last year. This reduction primarily
reflects higher ceded reinsurance payments in total across all reinsurers and
retrocessionaires, as well as some timing differences associated with Watford Re ceded
payments.
It also reflects lower gross premium collections, reflecting the drop in volume, particularly
from the loss of a large MTA (31:16) acquired by a competitor within our insurance group,
as has been discussed in previous calls, and a lower level of paid reinsurance recoveries
received due merely to timing differences.
The full calendar year 2015 core cash flow from operations was $705 million versus $998
million – $705 billion versus $998 million in this full – I think I misspoke that. The full calendar
year 2015 core cash flow from operations was $705 million versus $998 million in the full
2014 calendar year.
Core interest expense for the quarter was $12.8 million, which is consistent with our
longer-term run rate. Consolidated, therefore inclusive of Watford, interest expense was
$15.8 million, and since because we consolidate Watford, approximately $3 million of
interest expense is associated with the use of leverage within Watford's investment
portfolio. And as you recall, roughly 11% of Watford's results impact Arch's financial
statements.
Our effective tax rate on pre-tax operating income available to Arch shareholders for the
fourth quarter was an expense of 6.9%, compared to an expense of 1.7% in the fourth
quarter of last year. The full-year effective tax rate on pre-tax operating income was 5.1%
versus 2.4% for 2014 calendar year. This reflects $2.9 million or 26% of this quarter's total
tax being a true-up of the first three quarters of the year to this 5.1% annual tax rate.
Fluctuations in the effective tax rate can result from variability and the relative mix of
income or loss reported by jurisdiction, as was the case in this quarter. Our total capital
Page 10 of 31

Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2016-02-10

was $7.1 billion at the end of this quarter, up 0.6% relative to September 30 and up 1.1%
relative to 2014.

FINAL

Our debt-to-capital ratio remains low at 12.6%, and debt plus hybrids represents only 17.1%
of our total capital, which continues to give us significant financial flexibility. We also
continue to estimate having capital in excess of our target position.
During the full 2015 calendar year, we repurchased shares at an aggregate cost of $365
million versus the 2014 share repurchase aggregate cost of $454 million. This represents
71% of net income during 2015 and 56% of net income during 2014.
Book value per share was $47.95 at year-end, up 0.6 points and up 5.2% relative to a year
ago. This change in book value per share this quarter primarily reflects the company's
continued strong underwriting performance, virtually offset by the challenging quarter in
the financial markets.
So, with these introductory comments, we are now pleased to take your questions.

Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt with JPMorgan. Your

Hi. Good morning.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Good morning.

Q - Sarah E. DeWitt

{BIO 18946247 <GO>}

Just on the mortgage insurance business, I just want to get your latest thoughts on the
growth opportunities there. You've probably seen some of the mortgage stocks are
down 40% in the past six months on concerns about growth, pricing and competition. So
I'd be interested in your latest thoughts on that sector.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Well, as I said in my prepared remarks, we like the environment in this sector. The
underwriting quality of these mortgages is very high. The macroeconomic conditions,
they're positive. You will get fluctuations on a quarter-to-quarter basis on demand.
There's nothing we can do about the demand. However, let me point out to you that the
GSEs are through the bulk transactions. They're transferring a much more significant
portion of the risk to the private market. So there is ample opportunity on these riskPage 11 of 31

FINAL

sharing transactions to expand the demand for transferring risk to the private markets
which would participate. So, that is the environment.
As far as pricing, yes, there's been spots of competition, especially on the lender single
premium sector, but we've seen that easing in the first quarter on the basis that, with the
PMIERs and the capital requirements from PMIERs coming into effect, there is a higher
capital charge on discounted LPMI business. So, in essence, we've seen not only us doing
a lot less in that sector, but some of our competitors doing less. So we're very, very bullish
on that.
But I'm going to turn it over to Marc Grandisson to give a little bit of the color, because he
is embedded in that business and he has been since the beginning. So he probably knows
more detail than I do.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. At a high level, I think the U.S. MI – if I break it down in two pieces or two areas – is
the credit union channel that we have. We had already a very significant market share.
We're maintaining and actually growing it somewhat. So the growth there is going to
follow the overall market growth in MI origination and MI purchases.
The bank channel is going through a tremendous growth over the last year and most of
the growth on the MI are – in fact, pretty much 90% of the growth comes from the bank
channel. We're still in the early stages of establishing our presence, establishing our
relationships, and contacting our clients and growing that and establishing the pipes, if
you will, to deal with this.
At the same time, we have, as you know, established RateStar, and RateStar's initial – as
Dinos and I have noticed so (37:46) and we see the numbers. It's been a very initial, very
good response from the market. And that, I think, will lead to, hopefully, giving us more
penetration in the bank channel for the next 12 months.
And that's not even counting the U.S. risk-sharing that Dinos mentioned. The new
mandate, the new scorecard, the new – and evaluation that the FHFA will do for the GSEs,
they have to – from our expectations right now, the GSEs will have to in the risk-sharing
transactions probably buy 50%, possibly more over 2016 versus 2015. So, that's actually a
very bullish statement that private market is going to get a bigger place at the table.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Yeah. Let me add also one more point. It's more subtle point but I think it's important
based on where the financial markets are today. At the end of the day, we're one of two
or three of the highest rated MI companies. And I believe that a lot of the originators, I
don't care if it's commercial banks or mortgage originators, et cetera, they're going to
stop paying more attention to where they're placing their business.
Even though they're not a counter-party, Fannie and Freddie are the counter-party, I think
it's prudent to be placing your business with more highly-rated financial companies. So
Page 12 of 31



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2016-02-10

we're bullish about that because I think it's starting to be recognized especially by the
small banks that, hey, we'll rather do business with people that they have a better,
stronger financial rating than others who don't.

FINAL

Q - Sarah E. DeWitt

{BIO 18946247 <GO>}

Okay. Great. Thank you. And then, on the excess capital, I know it's a high class problem.
But given the stock back above a level where you'd repurchase stock, how do you think
about deploying that, and how long would you sit on the excess capital if the valuation
stays at these levels?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Well, we don't try to sit on excess capital. I mean, at the end of the day, we look at
opportunities to deploy as much of our excess capital. Our first choice is to deploy it in the
business. As we can see now, most of our opportunities, they're coming on the mortgage
side. And when we get dips in the market, as we have seen in the first quarter, and
literally our stock got punished unfairly as far as we're concerned. But at the end, it gave
us the opportunity for us to buy some of our shares back.

Bloomberg Transcript

If people don't like them at certain price, we like it, and that's the opportunities. We take
advantage of it. It was in the closed window by the way. And I did put a 10b-5 plan that it
worked for us, and it gave us the opportunity to purchase 1 million shares at reasonable
pricing as far as we're concerned.
So we're going to continue with that philosophy. And I believe we're going to get
opportunities as the market is starting now with some of our competitors to be putting
pressure on their financials that we can deploy more capital in the business because, at
some point in time, it's going to improve.
Now, if you look at it quarter-to-quarter, you might be too anxious. We have a more
longer-term view. We look at it on year-over-year. And I don't mind carrying a certain
amount of excess capital for the next year or so in order for me to have my powder dry in
case I get opportunities to deploy.

Q - Sarah E. DeWitt

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vinay Misquith with Sterne Agee.
Your line is open.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

FINAL

Hi. Good morning. So the first question is on RateStar. I believe you mentioned 783
players have signed up for RateStar, if I'm correct. How many of them are the large
players? Are you getting any of the large mortgage insurers, I mean – or the large banks
signing up for this program?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

In general, the smaller banks and the smaller-in-size originators, they embrace RateStar
more than the larger banks. But as you know, we give the opportunity to all of our
customers to choose either RateStar and/or the rate card. We haven't abandoned the
rate card.
What the RateStar does, it tries to evaluate the specific characteristics of a particular
mortgage and try to asses that risk and put the appropriate price on that risk. We have
not changed our ROE expectations for the entire book of business. We're pricing the
business – as a matter of fact, we believe RateStar will give us even better ROEs than the
old rate card. But that has been the environment.

Bloomberg Transcript

The incredible thing about RateStar is that we have the ability, live, to see every single
originator who is using the system. So, independent if that mortgage is going to be
placed with us – the mortgage insurance is going to place with us or not, we see every
single originator, every mortgage officer who is live on our system instantaneously.
So we monitor the volumes, we see who is using it, and which territories they're using, et
cetera, which for us is an incredible thing, especially also from a marketing point of view.
Because, to tell you a truth, we find some banks that maybe three, four or five of their
loan officers use RateStar significantly, and the other three, four, and we know all of them
by name, don't use it at all, and then it gives us an opportunity to go and have probably
the conversations as to why, why not.
So, Marc, do you want to add anything on the RateStar?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

No. The only thing I will concur and further confirm that there's – the highest level of
application that we receive are coming through the regional and commercial credit union
channel. The banks are bigger, a bit longer to go over and make the change and adopt
the RateStar application. But we – it's going to take time, but we're going to get there.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Yeah. We have approvals on RateStar, I believe, on 46 states.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Correct.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Right. And have you seen a pickup in business from RateStar? And I believe one of your
large competitors are not doing it. Have you seen some more competitors trying to do
something similar to what you're doing?

FINAL

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Well, early sign is a little bit of pickup, where we see – we see more of a pickup in
utilization. But, like I said, we only released this about two months ago. It was early
December. Now, we're in February. Sometimes, the process takes six weeks to eight
weeks for a mortgage to be placed. But, clearly, there is a noticeable uptick in the
utilization of the system and the applications that they go through the RateStar and they
get a quotation for that mortgage insurance.
Now, if that loan is going to be made and if they're going to place it with us, because I'm
sure they're comparing what our price is versus a rate card from some competitor, it's too
early to tell, but I'm optimistic.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Sure. And are you seeing other competitors also do something similar to your RateStar?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Marc, you close it.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yeah. You heard the call on Radian and MGIC. I mean, you can go through that and hear
what they have to say, and there's definitely a trend in the industry to go in that direction
to actually try and address the inefficiencies, frankly, that resides within the rate card
pricing to better address and better assess the risk within a portfolio.
But I need to remind you, as Dinos and Mark did on last call, that that endeavor of ours to
create RateStar took over a year to put together. This is no small feat. It included having
an amazing dedication and a big group of our people to really put it together. So I would
not be surprised – I know I can't speak to them, but I won't be surprised that our
competitors feel compelled to have to react to this as well.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

It's predictive analytics. Independent – if you've seen the auto insurance business or in the
mortgage insurance business, et cetera, it's the norm now. And if you're not willing to
assess risk appropriately and price it appropriately, at the end of the day you might be
subject to adverse selection over time, and we don't want to be in that category. So we
do challenge our people to create that innovation independent of the work effort that's
involved.

FINAL

Believe me, it's a five-quarter effort. I was involved in it. Marc Grandisson was involved in it.
And all of our CEOs, from Andrew Rippert to David Gansberg and his team in Walnut
Creek, we've put a big effort to do this. This is not something that, as one of our
competitors says, it's just some black box that spits out. There's a lot of effort, a lot of
analytics, a lot of historical data that we have used both from within the old PMI books that
we're running off on behalf of the regulator, but also with external databases that deal
with mortgage risk.
And we're proud of what we have achieved. And believe me, it's still a work in progress.
We will continue to improve it and improve it and improve it because it's not something
that is static. As we learn about the predictability of the model, then we will adjust. And it's
no different what we've done on the cat business, right? And you've seen our
performance on the cat business.
I think we have fared well over the years taking catastrophic risk because, at the end, we –
let's face it. I'm the only known actuary in the senior management team. I think they're
ready to expel me from the group. Everyone we have is a quant (49:19) here except me,
but I keep up with them. Everyone has grouped (49:23) for me.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yes. (49:24)

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Sure. That's helpful. Just one follow-up, just some numbers questions, if I may, really quick.
So first is on the expense ratio. So, just on the operating expenses, those were higher this
year versus last year. Just want to know if you plan to keep them flat next year. And the
second piece is on the P&C insurance on the acquisition expense ratio. Do you expect
that to decline this year because of higher ceding commissions?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Well, Mark, do you want to address this?

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Yeah. Let me do it...

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

And this is Mark Lyons. Because I've got two Marks. I've got Mark square now, so.

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Hopefully not a third phone call question mark. So let's take in reverse order. I think this is
the third quarter I commented on the quota share improvement on the Freddie ceding
commissions and it's been about 260 bps. It fluctuates a little bit, 260 bps. I think the
proportion getting that is increasing. So you get more of a gearing factor, firstly.

Page 16 of 31



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2016-02-10

FINAL

Secondly, I'm quoting those on a written basis, so you asked a semi-forward question. We
don't give guidance, but I think it's fairly straight forward that if you're getting those kinds
of benefit on a written basis, they're going to eat their way in over the next three or four
quarters. So I think it's reasonable to expect improvement and then likely flattening at that
point. However, there is continued improvement in the gross commission ratio, mostly as
a function of mix, and that was 110 bps. And that's a big part of reason for it as well.
On the OpEx side, let's say we like to look at these things in total. On the insurance group
side, you had some specials in there that were related, I think, to our UK operation. We
had some compliance things we dealt with. We had some Lloyd's cost. We had some
overlap of some IT, which I view as non-recurrent, shifting from exchanging to an internal
facility we have in the Philippines, actually, which I view those as non-recurrent. And the
reinsurance – the mortgage stuff side we know about. That has to come up to scale.
I think on the reinsurance side, that was dominated by the reduction in the net earned
premium. There's a little accounting going on when we brought Gulf Re in. But roughly an
additional $2 million of costs that come in more explicitly because Gulf Re is now a profit
center within the reinsurance group whereas before was more equity accounting.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Right.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

So, a little of that sleight of hand. So, to make the long story short, I would expect
continued improvements on the ceding commissions and insurance group, and I would
expect increasing management and flattening on the OpEx side.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Sure. Thank you.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Let me give you also a little bit of the strategic view that we have when it comes to
expenses. I said many times in many calls, we're not willing to part with our underwriting
capability. So we're going to maintain underwriters even if the market might cause us to
reduce writings because we're going to maintain – the two religions we have is
underwriting discipline and complete commitment to our good people, especially on the
underwriting side.
Having said that, we expect our managers to chew gum and walk at the same time. And
as a company, we have a very good turnover ratio, but still we have a turnover ratio which
is around 11% on an annualized basis. So, within that parameter, you try what I would call on
non-critical underwriting jobs to make adjustments on your expenses through natural
attrition. And that's been our philosophy from day one. A well-managed company plays
with those parameters and make the right judgment.

Page 17 of 31



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2016-02-10

And our people, they're very good and very flexible and they accept reassignments and
we move them from one operating unit to another where the opportunities are plentiful,
especially if where they work in, we have to reduce volume.

FINAL

So, with all that in the mix, I think, Mark, and you got into the minutia, you got into the nittygritty on the financials. But I want you to get the flavor of our philosophy and how we're
going to operate the company.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Sure. That's helpful. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar with Macquarie Capital.
Your line is open.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

Thanks and good morning to two Marks and one Dinos. Just very quickly going back to the
realized losses line, did you talk about what exactly was going on in the Watford segment
and why it had a realized loss?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

No, I have not talked about that. But I'll take that as a gas pedal. Well, I guess a couple of
things. First off, as you know, we kind of report Watford results. We don't drive Watford's
investment results. We're a minority owner, as you know. But as far as the accounting
world of it, they have elected the fair value option on investments. So, in their line of
realized gains and losses, it's actually the sum of realized and unrealized gains embedded
in there. So, hopefully, you find that helpful.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

Got it. And for the ex other segment, what did those realized losses stem from?

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Well, that's I'll call it harvesting or reverse harvesting. But it's just your standard churn of
fixed income and other investments that would have occurred throughout the course of
the quarter.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

Okay. I was just trying to figure out if there was anything more going on. That's helpful.
The other question I had, going back to the – obviously you spend a lot of time discussing
RateStar, and you are correct, other competitors are talking about it, and it's similar to
auto insurance where there's an early adopter advantage.

Page 18 of 31



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2016-02-10

FINAL

How should we think about sort of the timeline here where you still have that early
adopter's advantage for some time before others catch up? Is it fairly easy for them to
sort of get up to speed as to what you're doing because it has been done before and it
sort of puts you at parity at some point of time? Or is there so much of a separation that
it'll take a long period of time for the NMIs or ABNs or others to really catch up with you?
How should we think about that?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

The way you think about it, if you remain standing still, they're going to catch up to you,
but we keep walking. I think, as a matter of fact, I hope our guys, they keep running
because – and improving it, et cetera.
At the end of the day, it's how good is your thought process, what kind of algorithms that
you build into it, how much of empirical data and whatever database is that they give you
predictive analytics you're incorporating. And this is not nuclear physics. We're not putting
the next man in the moon, but it requires a lot of effort.

Bloomberg Transcript

I don't know how quickly they can catch up. It depends on to what kind of resources they
throw at it. But I can tell you, it was not a small effort on our part. But we're behind it. We
incurred the expense. We had a lot of our very senior guys working on it, because both
me and Marc Grandisson, and Andrew, and David Gansberg, we were very committed
that that's the way for the future. So we made it a very senior priority within the group to
do this. Then this is five quarters ago. This is not today.
So, Marc?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yeah. I think from our perspective, it is a competitive advantage. I won't say (58:04) we
were first mover because you rightly pointed out that some others have done it, I guess,
other competitors have done in fact. But clearly, this is creating, we think, some breathing
air, some headwind for us at least now, because of the fact that we already have installed
it, it's being used by our client. And we actually are going to be dynamic, as Dinos said,
going through the portfolio, analyze it, and modify and adjust it as we go forward. So we
feel pretty good where we are.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

Got it. And then, final question related to that. Does the ratings downgrade of Genworth
from S&P and Moody's, does that create a meaningful opportunity for the marketplace?
How should we think about that?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

It's too early to tell. So far, to my surprise, I'm hopefully a financial executive with average
intelligence. I would have thought that credit on a credit business will have more of an
effect as to who gets the business. But to my unpleasant surprise, it seems that a lot of
the mortgage originators sometimes don't care as to where they place the business
Page 19 of 31



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2016-02-10

because at the end they're not the counterparty, Fannie and Freddie is. But I don't think
that's the wise choice for them to do. For the time, I believe that will have to have some
effect because why would you continue doing business with somebody financially
challenged? But I leave that up to the market to determine.

FINAL

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 19777341 <GO>}

Another question on mortgage. How much of your business in 2015 was refi versus
purchase?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Marc will give you that number in a minute. I think you can dig it up.

Q - Charles Joseph Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

I guess I just wonder on the U.S. side if there's a potential slowdown on refi just due to
how long interest rates have been down at this level, if that's at all a headwind for you
guys in that business. And I guess...

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Well, I mean, refi creates more opportunities to write more insurance. And if you're
penetrating the market, refis have an effect on us because at the end of the day, we like
more refis along with new originations, but I don't know.
Marc, do you have the number? We can always offline – Don Watson will give you the
percentages. I don't have all the books in front of me right now.

Q - Charles Joseph Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

Okay. Well, and then looking at that, is the mortgage insurance part of the driver and the
change to the effective tax rate this year? If we kind of look at 2015, a bit over 5%. Is that

Page 20 of 31



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2016-02-10

a reasonable expectation for 2016 or going forward? Or does the growth in U.S.
mortgage have a lifting effect on overall consolidated tax rate?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

FINAL

Well, Lyons will give you the answer to that.

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Yeah. I love taxing questions. So, Chuck, it's a good point to bring up. It's partially
contributory. There's a lot of areas in higher tax jurisdictions like that that had very good
results in the year, mortgage being one of them, our Arch Re Facultative group, our
Morristown Arch Reco operation and the core insurance operation. So, a lot of that kind of
skewed it.
So, as mortgage becomes a higher proportion of total and as we continue to have these
margins, it will only creep up the effective tax rate, keeping everything else constant. We
don't know what's going to happen in the PC dynamics.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Charles Joseph Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

Okay. I guess – and then finally, on the P&C side, on the programs, I think you said you had
a large non-renewal of a program this quarter. And wanted to kind of get your take on is
that a competitive reason? Was that just an absolute result? I guess I'm trying to get some
insight on what's going on, on the smaller account risk side of the insurance business
because a lot of competitors keep talking about that as a means to deal with the pricing
in the large account space.

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Right. Well, it's good to be in a position where we've had it for years and years rather than
trying to gain it. So there's more renewals to us than new business to others. And in a
tough market environment, getting it on a new basis is a little tougher.
Chuck, it was a program that was bought by a competitor. It was fairly large. It was, on an
annualized basis, north of $80 million, hence $20 million in the quarter if we end up flat on
it. And we talked about action in other ones, but for calendar 2015, they're immaterial.
And this is one program that really affected it.

Q - Charles Joseph Sebaski

{BIO 17349221 <GO>}

Okay. I guess your competitors as well, which you guys fortunately haven't seen, is some
adverse development in some of the lines. So I was wondering if there's any comment on
loss cost trend going on on some of the longer-tail liability lines. Have you seen any
changes coming up or things kind of just status quo as they've been in the last few
quarters?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Page 21 of 31



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2016-02-10

We have very favorable loss cost trend across. But we do an analysis every year. But we
have not seen anything in the data that makes us change our expectation of loss cost
trend. It's still pretty low, but it's very stable for the last couple of years.

FINAL

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

I mean, Chuck, as we've talked about in the past, it's a different story by area. Mark's right.
Across the board weighted, we don't see anything material happening. You probably saw
all that securities class action suits, for example, that kind of returned to a long-term
normal or it had been below normal, things like that. But luckily, we don't seem to get hit
by a lot of the SCAs. So we'll make that someone else's problem.

Marc, you got the number?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yeah. Charles, I have the answer. I want to make sure I got the numbers right before I
quote it. It was a market where it was mostly a purchase market. 75% purchase, 25% refi.
As you know, the mortgage rates went up and it became more of a purchase market in
the fourth quarter.

Q - Charles Joseph Sebaski

Thanks. Just a couple of numbers ones, if I could. In the mortgage – or I'm sorry, in the
reinsurance segment, Mark, could you quantify the impact of that tax item that you talked
about in your script?

FINAL

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Yeah. Well, that wasn't really in the reinsurance segment. That was overall. That was $2.9
million, which I said was 26% of the total tax on pre-tax operating income. That's because
the effective tax rate is 5.1% for the year. It was less than that. As of third quarter, we have
to true it up. We have to bring them up to the same level. I stated...

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Maybe we're getting our signals crossed. I thought you said in the script that there was
some settlement of some tax matter?

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Oh, I'm sorry.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

All right.

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I'm sorry. And we're not alone in this. You probably heard it on some other calls.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Yep, yep.

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

It's the favorable tax ruling with regard to cascading FET where we had paid it in the past
and then the favorable ruling came down. So it was the reimbursement associated with
the prior cost expenditure.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it. And that rolled up into the other operating or in the acquisition?

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Well, there's some in insurance, there's some in reinsurance. It's mostly in acquisition.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Okay, okay. And then, just trying to figure out, like, what we should be thinking about on
the forward inning where we could sort of get some quantification of that?

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Well, it was about $3 million.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

FINAL

Okay.

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

And it's for one-time.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it. Okay. And then, sticking to reinsurance for a sec, the other operating expense
there. I mean, how should we be thinking about that on the forward? Dinos, I think you
might have mentioned talking about redeploying folks from one place to another. If we
continue to see the business there kind of recede, just given a lack of opportunities there
to invest, do you see that – is that an area where we would see that coming down, or do
you expect to maintain your infrastructure there?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

You got to break it into components, right? You got to break it into components. So how
much is internal expense and how much is commission, ceding commissions, et cetera. If
you don't write the business, you don't have the ceding commission expense.
Our intention is, and I've said it many times, and I know Marc Grandisson and I, we see
eye-to-eye to it, we have no intention of eliminating underwriting capabilities we have. I'm
not going to give my underwriters to the competition.
So we're going to maintain that because our view of the market is more long-term than
short-term. These are the same underwriters that generated significant profits for us
when the market was good for reinsurance, and that market will come back again to
supply and demand, and at some point in time, it will readjust.
So, from that perspective, for you when you're looking at your numbers, look at the
operating expense, break it down into what's internal versus external, meaning ceding
commissions and all that. And the internal run rate we're going to maintain, because I
don't expect us to reduce our underwriting capability.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Okay. And then, just sort of thinking about the underlying loss ratio there in reinsurance. I
mean, you saw year-over-year improvement despite some mix shift away from what I
would guess are higher profitability property lines at least relative to the rest of the book.
How should we think about that? I mean, was there anything sort of happened either in
the quarter or the year, just top of your mind maybe, Mark, just that helped to support

Page 24 of 31

that result? Or do you feel like 2015 was sort of what it was and that's a good starting
point to think about for the future?

FINAL

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Well, there's always seasonality in the business, firstly. So you got to watch the serial
comparisons. But there is some of the mix differences. I mean, the Facultative unit
performed well as it generally does and degree by which it well varies quarter-by-quarter.
But as Marc said, the property cat being de-emphasized and if it continues where the
margins are not, then we're likely to continue in that way. So the third-party businesses –
and the other opportunities that they've been getting there, I'll call, out of-themainstream opportunities continue to be in the pipeline.
So it's a little hard because it's probably only half of the business. It's probably what I'd call
standard business at this point. But I think fourth quarter is more of a reasonable go
forward.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Yeah.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

I think to further add to this, we're focusing on returns always and we have very, very agile
underwriting teams across the platform and regions and able to maneuver in and out of
markets as they see the returns get better or worse. A great example, as I mentioned in
my notes, is the UK motor. It has a higher loss ratio component by virtue of being a quota
share. You're not going to get a 20% loss ratio on that business unless that's under
extreme circumstances. So we are expecting to have a higher loss ratio.
But in the end, we don't worry so much about the components of the loss or expense. We
worry about the margin that we can derive from the business. And as I will echo with what
Dinos has said, I mean we have a pretty decent, agile team that's able to seek and source
and seek and capitalize on opportunities. And we have more always.

Q - Michael Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Great. And then, just maybe one last quick one if I could on the MI. Can you break down
how much of the action in your underwriting profitability has come from U.S. MI versus
whether it's reinsurance or the other business?

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

No. We generally don't talk about that. We review it and we manage it in a total segment
basis. So the whole strategy that Marc and his team, Andrew and his team has is they
balance the mixture of that, but they have a common macroeconomic view and
everything else. So we tend to look at in totality and report in totality.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.
Your line is open.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

Yeah. Good morning, afternoon. Thanks for taking my question in the long hour.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

It's souvlaki time.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

You've got souvlaki this time. I don't want to keep you. So here's a quick question...

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

No, no, no. Go ahead. Go ahead. We've got plenty of time. We can wait.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

No, no. That's it. I'm done. I'm done. No, I'm kidding. The Australian business, how should
we think about revenue going forward for the Australian business?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

It's hard for me to tell what's going to happen. It's an ongoing – the relationship that
we've established, as we mentioned over last year, it's been very fruitful. The quota share
agreements that we have with one of the major lenders down under, we have – it's
ongoing. There are things going on down under as you know. We have various option that
we're looking at. So it's really hard for me to tell you how it's going to go for the next year.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

It won't be any less, but we can – we don't know, hard to say what the new opportunities
are because we're engaged in a lot of discussions. Sometimes they have food and
sometimes they don't.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Is it going to be lumpy by necessity?

Page 26 of 31



Company N ame: Arch Capital Group L td
Company Ticker: ACGL US Equity
Date: 2016-02-10

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

No, it would be steady, lumpy on the upside if we do other transactions.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

FINAL

Right.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

And if we interrupt a relationship, it can be lumpy on the downside, but we don't
anticipate that.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Yeah. I think, Josh, I will say it's going to be lumpy on the written base, because the
business in Australia is written all upfront. The earning is going to take years to go. So, a
bit more stability on the earnings over time but the written, yes, rightfully could be very
lumpy.

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And just to reemphasize and clarify that, Josh, because I think it's easier to get some
confusion. That deal is not a single upfront premium like in the totality to the exposure.
Instead, it's a single premium market in Australia. So you're going to have – there is no
monthly really. So it's going to be a series of singles that come out through month-bymonth-by-month that come in, and we'll record accordingly.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

So, not an upfront number.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Right. It's quite mortgage-by-mortgage-by-mortgage-by-mortgage. And you're earning
that over the duration of that and it's a long duration, seven years, eight years, nine years.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Very good. And on Watford, and I don't know enough about the investment strategy at
Watford. It looked like the investments had a good quarter last quarter. Now, we're in this
bumpy market right now. How should market volatility affect investment results at
Watford?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Well, I mean we don't make those decisions, Highbridge makes that. But, in essence, their
approach hasn't changed. I know when the spreads have widened, they're going to take

FINAL

marks. But they feel comfortable with the quality of the portfolio and the embedded yield
which is in the 7% and higher. And now it will be a question as to where the economy goes
and would they have any deep holes.
But we don't see – based on our reviews that we get on a quarterly basis as a 11% owner,
we don't see significant risk to that. They analyze every investment one-by-one, and they
put probabilities of the fall and recoveries. And it depends where the economy goes. But
if we don't have a recession, I think they are in good shape.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much. And should there be another questions, enjoy the souvlaki.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. Your line is
open.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Great. Thanks. Two quick mortgage questions, if I can. First, if you look over, I don't know,
fourth quarter conference calls, a lot of (01:15:55) are talking about mortgage reinsurance.
Are you seeing a more competitive market in general for that?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

A little bit more, but I don't think it's the competition. It's more participation and a lot of
that we see in the bulk transactions that the GSEs, they're purchasing now for the 20% to
40% downpayment. This is the 60% to 80% LTV business that the GSEs buy through the
STACR and Connecticut Avenue Securities transactions in the market. And you have a
broader participation there by other reinsurance. And of course, some of the MIs that they
needed to comply with the PMIER capital requirement, they might have done some
transactions in order for them to come up to the capital standards that they need to
prove to the GSEs that they're compliant. But I don't see a major change of that going
forward. I think most of that participation is going to happen on the bulk transactions.
Marc...

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

I agree with you.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

...anything else you wanted to add to it or...

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

Agreed.

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

FINAL

Well said.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. And then second, as – I get that mortgage, at least, written premium growth is
going to be lumpy. But as we see better market conditions there than insurance and
reinsurance, does that have an impact on the investment portfolio? Does it give you even
more room for longer-term investing philosophy?

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

Yeah. Yeah. I would say, Meyer, that it's a function of the duration of the aggregate
portfolio at that point in time. So I'd say, as it becomes a higher proportion of total, it's
going to inch up duration on it and therefore have it matching on it on the investment
side.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. Perfect. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Don't forget, our investment philosophy is basically on the liability side of the business.
We match durations with those liabilities. And on the shareholder capital, we have a view
that it can be very short, either zero duration all the way up to five-year duration,
depending how our investment committee and the board believes the market conditions
dictate. And right now, on the shareholder capital, we're above neutral. So our duration is,
what, 3.6 years, Marc?

A - Marc Grandisson

{BIO 4369887 <GO>}

3.4 years.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

3.4 years. And our duration of our liabilities is not that different from that. So we're kind of
neutral where we are today.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay. Great.

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

But we can elongate that or go short on that, depending what we do with the
shareholders' equity capital.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Carletti with JMP Securities.
Your line is open.

Q - Matthew J. Carletti

{BIO 5249827 <GO>}

Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I just had a follow-up on Amit's question on the realized
losses in the quarter. Mark, that was really hopefully, the kind of color on the other
segment and how Watford treats it. But I guess my question is on the subtotal of the
operating segments. It's still a pretty big number in the quarter relative to history, at least.
Particularly the quarter equities are up. So I'm just wondering, is there any OTTI to note
there or performance of alternatives, or was it just kind of more very run-of-the-mill?

A - Constantine P. Iordanou

{BIO 2397727 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So our OTTI was very small for the quarter. It was in the single millions of dollars. We have
a total return philosophy and our portfolio trades quite a bit, and sometimes you're going
to see realized losses coming through because they might be repositioning the portfolio
from one security to another, and we take the marks. Where other companies, when they
buy and hold, they might have more unrealized marks where we might have more
realized.

A - Mark Donald Lyons

{BIO 6494178 <GO>}

There's also been a purposeful repositioning of the portfolio. You've probably noticed
that not just the movement into U.S. corporates and municipals, but a de-emphasis of
mortgage-backed securities and commercial mortgage-backed securities and so forth, so
you can compare it year-over-year. So Dinos's point is right. As you know, as you make
these decisions and churns, you're moving them into the bucket of just marks that would
be unrealized since the – but that's done with the thought of the future view of the
portfolio of returns.

Q - Matthew J. Carletti

{BIO 5249827 <GO>}

Yeah. That makes sense. That makes perfect sense. Thanks for the color.

Operator
Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back

A - Constantine P. Iordanou
