Operator
Welcome to the Old Mutual Wealth update. (Operator Instructions) Just to remind you,
the call is being recorded. I'm now pleased to present our host, Paul Feeney, CEO of
Mutual Wealth. Please begin.

Paul Feeney

{BIO 17570862 <GO>}

Thank you. Hi, guys. Thank you for joining us today. I'm joined here by Tim Tookey, our
CFO; and Mark Satchel, our Corporate Finance Director. So I'll say a few words of
introduction, then we'll be happy to take your questions.
First of all, we're pleased to be announcing the sale of our Single Strategy asset
management business today to TA Associates for an expected total consideration of GBP
600 million. So this is made up of cash consideration of GBP 570 million payable on or
before completion, with approximately GBP 30 million anticipated to be payable primarily
over 2019 and -- to 2021, as surplus capital is released from the business.
So this has been a great business for us. And we're really pleased with how it's grown
under our stewardship. But as we said, like with our showcase in November, it's a different
business with very different characteristics to the rest of our business in terms of
customers, product and distribution. It's institutionally focused, the rest of our business is
retail focused. A large part of its economic value comes from performance fees, which
are potentially much more volatile than the rest of our business. And it doesn't share

distribution with the rest of our business, which is built upon an advice-led proposition. So
simply put, it's less aligned to our business model moving forward.
So while we would have been happy to own this business long term as a distinctly
branded boutique asset manager, given its very different characteristics to the rest of our
businesses, we felt it was in everybody's best interest to consider both internal and
external options for the business. And the potential external purchases included financial
buyers, strategic buyers and existing industry players. Against this highly competitive
backdrop, TA Associates emerged as the most attractive bidder on a number of grounds,
including price and ability to execute. We believe that selling the Single Strategy business
today and allowing our management efforts and investment priorities to be wholly
focused on delivering on our ambition of building the U.K.'s leading wealth manager will
deliver the best outcome, both for our plc's current shareholders and Quilter's future
shareholders.

While legal ownership is going to transfer at closing, the timing of which is difficult to
predict at the moment due to the need for regulatory approvals, the actual economic
ownership of the business is going to transfer to TA Associates on the 1st of January 2018.
Therefore, accrued profit in the business from the Single Strategy business will transfer
with the business when the transaction completes. All profits up until the end of
December this year will be due to us, to Old Mutual Wealth.
So importantly, there is no price adjustment for any changes in overall market levels. This,
obviously, gives us downside protection from market movements, which in the context of
the ongoing work regarding the plc balance sheet and developing the capital needs of
our own balance sheet, this is important for us.
As you know, we've already started breaking out the financials of the multi asset and
Single Strategy businesses, with the former an integral part of our business. So work is
well underway to ensure a smooth transition of the businesses and to ensure that
appropriate transitional arrangements are in place to support the Single Strategy
business. So we're pleased with the outcome to date.
With that, I'm happy to take questions. Let me hand back to the operator.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Andy Sinclair of Bank of
America Merrill Lynch.

Q - Andrew Sinclair

{BIO 17749036 <GO>}

I have 3 questions, if I may. Firstly, I just want to check if there's any distribution
agreements or other responsibilities for either the group or the Single Strategy business
to each other after this transaction completes? Secondly, just wanted to check if there's
Page 2 of 8



Company N ame: Quilter PL C

Date: 2017-12-19

any particular capital being passed across with the Single Strategy business, anything we
should be aware of there? And thirdly, just on liquidity in the group. And in particular, within
Old Mutual Wealth continues to build strongly. Just wondered at which point -- at what
point do you think that starts to look excessive?

FINAL

A - Paul Feeney

{BIO 17570862 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks, Andy. Mark, do you want to take the first one, any distribution agreements?

A - Mark Satchel

{BIO 18275874 <GO>}

Sure. Yes. So Andy, we will continue to work very much with the Single Strategy business
going forward. We committed to supporting them and making sure that they are -- had
access to our platforms and other things just like they currently do and just as other thirdparty distributors do. So we expect that we will continue to have an ongoing fruitful
relationship with them, along terms -- along very similar terms to what exists for other top
partners that we use on a regular basis.

A - Paul Feeney

{BIO 17570862 <GO>}

Okay. Mike, do you want to take the second one while you're on, any capital being passed
across to the...

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Mark Satchel

{BIO 18275874 <GO>}

So Andy, we obviously ensure that the business is well capitalized at the point of transfer.
That's being the business is in growth mode. So the capital needs are increasing. Some of
the deferred consideration or most of the deferred consideration is in relation to
additional capital that we will be putting into the business in a standalone capacity that we
expect to unwind as a consequence of the separation. It takes a while for it to unwind
through the regulatory calculation, which is why it is deferred and it will be returned to us
in due course under the agreement.

Q - Andrew Sinclair

{BIO 17749036 <GO>}

So that GBP 30 million gives kind of a fair quantum for that, is that fair to say?

A - Mark Satchel

{BIO 18275874 <GO>}

Correct.

A - Paul Feeney

{BIO 17570862 <GO>}

Okay. Tim, do you want to take the liquidity question?

A - Tim Tookey

{BIO 4817047 <GO>}

Yes. I mean, on liquidity, works -- the work is still going on, Andy, around the, what I'll call,
the simultaneous equations of plc's balance sheet and our own. But remember on this
one that we don't know yet when legal completion will take place. So it's quite likely that

Page 3 of 8



Company N ame: Quilter PL C

will take place after management separation is complete. So it -- we'll be taking all sorts
of things into account in that ongoing work.

Operator

FINAL

(Operator Instructions) And we have a follow-up from Andy Sinclair of Bank of America
Merrill Lynch.

Q - Andrew Sinclair

{BIO 17749036 <GO>}

No one else is going. So I'll have another shot. Just one more question. Just for the
ongoing operational and IT responsibilities for the 2-year period, just wondered if you
could tell us the revenue and cost implications for the remaining group?

A - Paul Feeney

{BIO 17570862 <GO>}

Mark?

A - Mark Satchel

{BIO 18275874 <GO>}

Sorry, Andy, just repeat. That's the -- you said ongoing IT...

Q - Andrew Sinclair

{BIO 17749036 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

The release mentioned ongoing operational and IT transactional service agreements for
the -- for a period of two years. Just wondered on the revenues and expense implications
for the remaining group of that?

A - Mark Satchel

{BIO 18275874 <GO>}

So that's all been done at cost and the current arrangements. And really, it's just a normal
GSA that we've set up with some of the work we've done on other disposals in Germany,
Switzerland or the rest of it. Andy, the total amount of all transitional services is
somewhere in the region of GBP 9 million or GBP 10 million a year. And that's a runoff over
time. But it's costed up. Things sort of mark up when anything obstructs that. So the
natural underlying business is mutual in terms of the cost that it's incurring as far as that's
concerned.

Operator
And our next question comes from Johny Lambridis[ph]

Q - Unidentified Participant
Recently, as in six months ago, Old Mutual Wealth got a capital injection from the plc of
GBP 200 million. Just trying to work out now with you receiving GBP 570 million, whether
that's going to be repaid or if the GBP 570 million would all stay within Old Mutual Wealth
into the proposed listing?

A - Paul Feeney

{BIO 17570862 <GO>}

I'll hand that to Tim.

FINAL

A - Tim Tookey

{BIO 4817047 <GO>}

Yes. Johny[ph], thanks for joining the call. So as I said back in showcase, work is ongoing
with the day 1 balance sheets of Old Mutual Wealth as Quilter will be as well as separation.
So the GBP 200 million that was injected was really just the first stage of that. In fact, I
think first step or first stage is how we described it in the prelims in August. So the work is
ongoing. Clearly, the timing of completion of the transaction with TA Associates is
unknown. So it is quite possible that, that completion will come through once also all the
managed separation and the listing of Quilter will then be -- going to be -- have been
completed. So on that basis, we're happy to prepare for listing with appropriate balance
sheet and liquidity work that make sure we're adequately capitalized, taking that potential
timing into account. So there's still work going on, on this front.

A - Mark Satchel

{BIO 18275874 <GO>}

But we will -- I think the likelihood is that we'll --

A - Paul Feeney

{BIO 17570862 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

The likelihood is that the completion will happen after listing. So we're factoring all of this
into the balance sheet work that we're doing -- and the work that's going on developing,
the working capital pieces that are necessary for the prospectus.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Okay. So will the -- although profits will pass to the new owners 1 January, completion is
expected on the, what, Third Quarter of next year?

A - Tim Tookey

{BIO 4817047 <GO>}

Yes. It's difficult to predict the exact timing of completion. But you're right, when
completion happens, then we would expect the value that is accrued post the 1st of
January to be for the buyer, for the buyer, that is correct.

A - Paul Feeney

{BIO 17570862 <GO>}

The profit, yes. Then the value of the transaction completing will, obviously, be ours, Old
Mutual Wealth's.

Operator
(Operator Instructions) And our next question comes from Azhar Nojie[ph] of Massey
Asset Management[ph].

FINAL

It's Sander[ph] here. I just wanted to -- yes, cool. Just to check in terms of the, I guess, the
metrics of the sale are now relative to listed -- the reported NAV that you -- of asset
management -- of, sorry, of wealth overall. What proportion of that reported NAV would
you estimate to be single management business would have made up, let's say, at, let's
say, at interim's period?

A - Paul Feeney

{BIO 17570862 <GO>}

That's definitely one I'm going to pass, if I can. Mark, do you know what the percentage of
the reported NAV is of our total reported NAV on...

A - Mark Satchel

{BIO 18275874 <GO>}

It's round about -- look, it fluctuates quite a lot within the asset management business,
depending on what should sort of date you take. At 30 June, I'm not quite sure what the
gross is. But at 31/12, it's about GBP 100 million in terms of NAV. So I'm going back to last
year, 31/12. I don't have the June number to hand. But that's more or less the amount of
the NAV.

Q - Unidentified Participant
And I mean, if possible, would you mind sharing that, if you can, maybe at later stage, if
that's okay?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Tim Tookey

{BIO 4817047 <GO>}

Sure. Certainly, Sander, it's Tim. When we get to prelims, we'll be able to give more
information on this. And of course there is an element of goodwill that will be attached to
this when we come actually to finalizing the numbers. We'll be able to give more clarity on
this at prelims.

Operator
And our next question comes from Tom Eckett of Investment Week.

Q - Tom Eckett
I just want to -- do you think you can provide a bit of color about the sort of main drivers
behind the sale and just the reasons for doing this at this time, that'll be great.

A - Paul Feeney

{BIO 17570862 <GO>}

Yes. Sure, Tom. The main reason is simply that the business is great business. We've -- it's
grown very well together under our stewardship. But it's less aligned with our overall
business. We're building a, I'll call it, building U.K.'s leading management business. We're
all completely retail focused. We're an advice-based business. And this is a part of our
business which is -- it's different. I mean, it's less closely aligned to that. It's commonly
wholesale institutional based. The nature of the earnings of the business are different
from the rest of our business because it's a highly performance fee based. Our business
is retail focused, apart from this business. It doesn't share the rest of our distribution. So

Page 6 of 8

we thought if we're going to do it, if we're going to look at it, we have to look at it now.
And if we wanted to make a decision, as I said a while ago, we'll make a decision on this in
time -- well in time and well ahead of our managed separation because people want
certainty, obviously. And I think we got a great outcome for everybody.

FINAL

Operator
(Operator Instructions) And we do have a follow-up from Tom Eckett of investment Week.

Q - Tom Eckett
Have another stab. Tim, you've provided a bit of breakdown of ownership on that side so
you should know who's going to be working with TA Associates. Is it going to be Richard,
who's going to -- who's also part of this buyout? Or if you add a bit on color on that, that
will be great as well.

A - Paul Feeney

{BIO 17570862 <GO>}

Yes. No, Tom, we don't do that. But clearly, Richard. But thanks for trying.

{BIO 17570862 <GO>}

Okay. A bit more questions?

Operator
No, no further questions at this time.

A - Paul Feeney

{BIO 17570862 <GO>}

Okay, okay. Well guys, listen, thank you very much. We really appreciate you joining the call
at such short notice. Obviously, a short notice for a reason. We had to put that out[ph]
quite quickly this morning. So appreciate that. We're pleased -- we're very pleased with
the deal. We think it's a good deal for everybody. It's a good deal for our shareholders. I
think it gives the Single Strategy business a good opportunity. I think it gives certainty and
clarity to our listing, which is approaching quicker by the day. So thank you very much, guys.
If I don't speak to all of you before the holidays, then have a good holiday. Merry
Christmas. See you in the new year.

Operator
This now concludes the conference. Thank you, all very much for attending. You may now
disconnect.
