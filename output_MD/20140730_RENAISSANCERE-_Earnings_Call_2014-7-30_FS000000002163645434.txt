Before we begin, I'm obliged to caution that today's discussion may contain forwardlooking statements and actual results may differ materially from those discussed.
Additional information regarding the factors shaping these outcomes can be found in
RenaissanceRe's SEC filings, to which we direct you.
With us to discuss today's results are Kevin O'Donnell, President and Chief Executive
Officer; and Jeff Kelly, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. I'd now like to
turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin?

Kevin J. O'Donnell
Thanks, Peter, and good morning, everyone. For this morning's call, I'll start with some
broad themes for the quarter and I'll turn it over to Jeff to talk about financial results and
then I'll come back on for some more detailed comments on the renewal.

Bloomberg Transcript

Last night, we reported an annualized operating return on equity of 11% for the second
quarter. Growth in tangible book value per share plus accumulated dividends was 3.5%.
On a year-to-date basis, we have generated net income of $272 million and an annualized
operating return on equity of 13.4% and have grown tangible book value per share plus
accumulated dividends by 6.4%. This was a tough renewal for the industry and we saw the
same trends continuing, namely intense competition and ongoing pressure on rates.
Against this backdrop, the team executed well, putting into practice the playbook we
have consistently operated in soft market conditions like these. We cut back on business
that did not meet our return hurdles. We positioned our portfolio and bought ceded retro
to reduce risk, in line with our consistent strategy to optimize our book of business.
Our strategy is based on a long-term view. We have invested in understanding risk,
underwriting it and matching it against capital for over 20 years, focused always on
managing our portfolio efficiently. Our customers value our experience and trust us to
help them with the unexpected.
It's been all too easy for the industry to have a short-term memory, given the eight-year
hiatus without a major landfalling and hurricane in Florida and five years without a
meaningful event in the Southeast. As we advance through storm season, we are more
conscious than ever that good preparation, not good luck, should be the basis of sound
risk management. The ability to properly assess the risk that one takes on and to
differentiate between attractive and unattractive business remains more important than
ever.
At this point, I'll turn it over to Jeff for his comments on results.

Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'll cover our results for the second quarter
and the year-to-date. We had a profitable second quarter again benefiting from solid
underwriting, relatively low catastrophe losses and a favorable investment environment.

FINAL

Our managed cat top-line decline in the second quarter to a large extent reflected the
competitive market dynamics that we have been highlighting on our recent calls and our
decision to pull back on business that did not meet our return criteria. As competition
intensified, we elected instead to reduce the risk in our Florida book through opportunistic
ceded retro purchases, which I'll discuss later on in my remarks.
We reported net income of $121 million or $2.95 per diluted share and operating income
of $94 million or $2.28 per diluted share for the second quarter. The annualized operating
ROE was 11% for the second quarter, and our tangible book value per share, including
change in accumulated dividends increased by 3.5% during the period. For the first six
months of the year, we reported an annualized operating ROE of 13.4% and growth in
tangible book value per share plus dividends of 6.4%.
Let me shift to the segment results beginning with our Cat segment and followed by
Specialty Reinsurance and Lloyd's. Managed cat gross premiums written declined $180
million or 29% compared with a year ago during the second quarter. Adjusting for prioryear reinstatement premiums of $10 million, a $27 million multi-year contract written and
booked in the year-ago period and $28 million less on a single quota share contract this
year relative to the prior-year period, Managed cat premiums declined approximately 21%
in the second quarter and 15% for the first six months of 2014.

Bloomberg Transcript

The top-line decline for cat premiums so far this year was driven largely by increased
pricing competition, exposure reduction and repositioning of our portfolio as we moved
higher up in layers relative to a year ago. The year-to-date decline in managed cat
premiums is slightly greater than our full-year guidance for a decline of 15%.
Net premiums written in our Cat segment declined 47% in the second quarter and are
down 34% for the first six months of the year, reflecting the reduction in gross premiums
written as well as increased ceded retro purchases. During the quarter, we entered into a
retro transaction in which we purchased $180 million of limit on a UNL basis to reduce the
frequency or lower layer risk for a peak Florida exposure. Ceded premiums directly
related to this deal totaled $23 million. This was an attractive transaction for us and
allowed us to enhance expected returns on our portfolio while also reducing expected
volatility and freeing up some capital.
The second quarter combined ratio for the Cat unit of 48.2% benefited from overall
benign catastrophe loss experience. The main contributor to losses in the quarter was a
series of smaller wind and thunderstorm events in the US, and net favorable reserve
development totaled $1.7 million for the unit during the quarter. The main moving parts
were a reduction to our ultimate loss estimates for 2011 April and May tornadoes, offset
partially by some adverse development for the 2010 New Zealand earthquake and 2012
wind, hail and flooding event in Texas.
In the Specialty Reinsurance segment, gross premiums written declined by 12% in the
second quarter compared with the year-ago, reflecting a generally competitive
environment for specialty casualty. For the first six months of the year, Specialty gross

Page 3 of 21

Company Ticker: RN R US Equity

FINAL

premiums written are up 46%, driven primarily by the inception of a small number of large
financial lines in mortgage insurance quota share transactions in the first quarter.
As we have often stated in the past, percentage growth rates for this segment can be
uneven on a quarterly basis, given the size and nature of the transactions. The growth
rate in the quarter compares with our full-year 2014 guidance of up over 20%. The
Specialty Reinsurance combined ratio for the second quarter came in at 78.9%, as loss
activity was again generally benign. Favorable reserve development here totaled $5
million in the quarter.
In our Lloyd's segment, we generated $72 million of premiums in the second quarter, an
increase of 5% compared with the year-ago period. For the first six months of the year,
gross premiums written are up 9%. This compares with our full-year guidance for
premiums to be up over 20%, with the shortfall reflecting challenging market conditions.

Bloomberg Transcript

The Lloyd's unit came in at a combined ratio of 101.3% for the second quarter, also
benefiting from generally low loss activity. The favorable reserve development of $9
million was principally driven by the application of the company's formulate reserving
methodologies for establishing IBNR reserves and did not relate to any particular events.
We believe the financial results for the first six months of the year are more indicative of
the run rate results for this segment.
The expense ratio remained high at 48.6% but has generally been trending down as the
unit grows its premium base. Offsetting the improvement in the operating expense ratio
has been an increase in the acquisition expense ratio due to higher seating commissions
on quota share contracts.
Turning to investments, we reported net investment income of $35 million in the second
quarter. Our private equity portfolio generated a gain of $8 million in the second quarter,
driven by continued favorable equity market conditions. Recurring investment income
from fixed maturity investments included approximately $3 million in gains on the bank
loan portfolio, which we began reporting late last year as a part of fixed income securities.
Adjusting for that gain, fixed maturity investment income remained under pressure from
low interest rates but was reasonably consistent with prior-year periods.
The total return on the overall investment portfolio was 0.9% for the second quarter,
benefiting from strong alternative investment returns and sizable realized and unrealized
gains and the values of fixed income securities due to a decline in interest rates and
credit spreads. Our investment portfolio remains conservatively positioned, primarily in
fixed maturity investments, with a high degree of liquidity and modest credit exposure.
The duration of our investment portfolio remained short at 2.2 years and has remained
roughly flat over the course of the year. The yield to maturity on fixed income and shortterm investments declined slightly to 1.5%.
Turning to capital, as we've stated in recent calls, we continue to believe we have capital
in excess of our requirements given our portfolio and our outlook for the business. We
endeavor to optimize the size of our capital base to business opportunities and seek to
Page 4 of 21

Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2014-07-30

FINAL

return excess capital to our investors when it is the most suitable option. Our preferred
method of returning capital has historically been through share repurchases and we
expect that will remain the same.
As we've often said, the timing of share repurchases on a quarterly basis will depend on a
number of factors, including the capital needs of our underwriting portfolio, our projected
liquidity requirements and the valuation of our stock. For the second quarter, we've
repurchased 385,000 shares for a total of $37 million. Year-to-date, we've repurchased
3.4 million shares for an aggregate cost of $314 million.
Effective July 1, we also sold a part of our existing shares in DaVinci to a third party
investor, which further reduced our stake to 23.4% from 26.5% prior to the transaction.
While we are not seeking to increase the size of DaVinci given the current competitive
market environment, we have gradually reduced our ownership stake in order to bring in
high-quality investors who we believe will be excellent long-term partners.

Bloomberg Transcript

Finally, let me turn to update our top-line forecast for 2014. We have already written the
bulk of our cat premiums for the year, and year-to-date, managed cat premiums are
down slightly more than the 15% guidance we have been giving. At this point, we expect
that will probably play out through year-end.
For Specialty Reinsurance, we are maintaining our top-line guidance to be up over 20%,
recognizing that premium trends can be volatile on a quarterly basis. In our Lloyd's unit,
we are lowering our top-line guidance to growth of approximately 10%. This is a function
of the competitive dynamics in the marketplace that have reduced the opportunities for
profitable expansion.
Thanks. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Kevin.

Kevin J. O'Donnell
Thanks, Jeff. This is the quarter where much of the focus, of course, is on the June 1
Florida renewals. While we saw both strong demand with increased purchases and new
limit bought in Florida, there was ample capacity to meet this demand and the result was
a very competitive renewal.
The increased demand in the Florida market and strengthening health of primary
companies over the past couple of years are all long-term positives. Many companies are
also electing to use cost savings from lower reinsurance rates to purchase more
protection.
Larger buyers were generally loyal to their existing panels, intended to maintain core
relationships. However, as we had anticipated, there was greater pricing pressure
resulting from non-core participants competing hard for market share. This resulted in
price reductions in excess of what we were originally expecting. Nonetheless, we were
able to construct a good portfolio with lower risk. Our longstanding relationships with

Page 5 of 21

Date: 2014-07-30

FINAL

brokers and clients provided us with access to the business we sought to write, and we
continue to draw upon our suite of options to manage inwards and outwards.
Retro pricing and capacity has followed the general market trend, giving us the
opportunity to increase our ceded protections. During the quarter, we successfully
executed exceeded retro transactions specifically for Florida, decreasing our exposure to
more frequent return periods. So in our vernacular, we are less hot down low than we
were last year.
Interestingly, as market participants have had greater access to models and tools to
understand risk, one might have expected a more efficient market. However, instead of
greater efficiency, the clock seems to have turned back to the 1990s and there has
instead been a return to a single view of risk and a resulting decline in risk-assessment
quality. We believe that the right way to price risk is to consider multiple views,
understanding the full distribution of outcomes.

Bloomberg Transcript

We have seen an increasing focus on the single point answer and expected loss reached
by finding the mean of all outcomes, which we believe is flawed. This over-reliance on a
single view of risk not only encourages poor pricing behavior, it can also lead to poor
portfolio construction. We believe that good underwriting will continue to be the key
differentiator among reinsurers and capital providers, and it's the best path for long-term
success.
There has been a lot of discussion about whether the current softening is permanent or
cyclical. One permanent factor is the many sources of capital available to accept cat risk.
We have believed this for a long time, which is why we structured RenaissanceRe to
include third-party capital many years ago. But I believe that not all this capital will be
permanent. It's important to point out that different types of capital are attractive to this
business at different times. The forms we're managing now are very different to postKatrina capital, and understanding how to manage all forms of capital in all pricing
environments is required for long-term success.
As for cycles, I believe all markets have cycles. The key is knowing what the characteristics
of the cycle are and how to recognize them. More interesting than whether the market
change is cyclical or permanent is the question about how to compete in any given market
environment. We believe you need great risk assessment, great access to business, and
you need to rigorously manage our cost of capital.
Our track record across all cycles has been market-leading in that regard, and our
business model has the flexibility to manage a variety of forms of capital, no matter what
the market dynamics. I'm very confident that we are well positioned to continue to find
good risk and to match it with the most efficient capital going forward.
Turning to our international book now, our mid-year renewals were Japan and Australia,
and in both markets, we saw general pricing pressure dynamics. Our established
relationships served us well and we maintained our participations in those regions as well
as finding attractive opportunities. Collaboration across our different business units and

platforms allowed us to expand our product offering and served the needs of our multiregional clients.
In Specialty, we have continued to establish our franchise across all lines despite a general
competitive market. I'm pleased with the book we have constructed. We have achieved
this by leveraging opportunities provided by our new platforms and working with
customers we have known for a long time who recognize the value of the RenRe
franchise.
Our Lloyd's operation continues to make good progress. Much of the expansion has
resulted from capitalizing on relationships in Bermuda, especially on the property side.
Five years on, we continue to be measured and deliberate in our growth. We now have
the infrastructure fully in place to scale this business when we see attractive opportunities.
As we look to the future, our rated and unrated balance sheets provide us with unique
flexibility to match well-structured risk efficiently with appropriate capital. At the same
time, we continue to offer value beyond capital for our clients and partners by blending
market insight and experience with financial strength. I believe the combination makes
RenaissanceRe one of the best-placed companies, not in just today's market but over the
years to come.
And with that, we're ready to take questions. Thank you.

Q&A
Operator
Your first question comes from the line of Josh Stirling from Sanford Bernstein.

Q - Josh Clayton Stirling

{BIO 17463087 <GO>}

Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. So I recognize this is a challenging
renewal and it's easy for us all to be difficult because we don't actually work in the
business, but we're trying to frame this. And I wonder, Kevin, a really big picture question.
if you take probably the view of your career at RenRe, when you started the business and
broadly was probably a 20% plus ROE kind of business, and then after Hurricane Katrina,
higher capital standards came in from the rating agencies and maybe it came down to
15%. You'll have a better sense of all these numbers, but I'd guess over the past two
years, pricing must be down something like 20% or 30% on some sort of risk adjusted
basis. And I'm wondering if I can simplify this to say that property cat is now really just a
10% ROE business. And if that's sort of not the right high-level math, I'm wondering if
maybe you could walk me through the way you think about it.

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Sure. I have been here for a long time, and I've seen a lot of different markets going back
to when I started in 1996. Each market I've seen has been different, and when I look at the
portfolios that we've built in those markets, we've built them in a way which matched the
Page 7 of 21



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2014-07-30

FINAL

right amount of risk to the right amount of capital. In the late 1990s, our portfolio was very
much constructed to be a net portfolio with little third-party capital, and then over the
years, we've built in more third-party capital.
I think thinking about the returns in this business, it is one in which rates are certainly down
and one is being paid less for the risk they are taking today than they were last year for
sure. But it's a business where I believe the portfolios we're constructing still afford
attractive returns. The other piece that had fed (22:36) into the returns is really what's
going on with investments and that's really kind of more universally affecting people. But
from the risk portfolio, we have seen a decline in the overall returns of the risk portfolio,
but it's one in which we're not at levels – we're not at the lowest levels that I've seen since
I've been here, for sure.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Josh Clayton Stirling

{BIO 17463087 <GO>}

Okay. So that's helpful. I – sort of a different question but similar topic, on pricing, and all
of us trying to sort of second guess how much more longer the pricing pressure might
last. You guys both play in the traditional reinsurance market as well as a lot of the
collateralized – you do a lot of different things all throughout the sort of the market. One
of the markets that I'd look to guidance for in some ways is the cat bond market. And I'm
wondering when you guys think about cat bond spreads, what investors are paying for risk
and you compare it to things like similarly rated junk bonds, which are at all-time lows. How
much more margin is there for new money to be allocated into this space? And how much
pricing pressure in the future would – if you believe that there was ultimately true
conversions and the sort of similar ratings for similar margins or similar spreads, how much
more pressure would that put on this business? Is this – do we still have 10% or 20%
pricing declines to come?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
I think cat bonds still trade largely at the more remote return periods. So let's kind of just
focus on that for a second. We did see some pushback on cat bond pricing earlier this
year when spreads were continuing to contract. And the way that market has been trading
is really just a multiple of expected loss rather than considering the full uncertainty of the
bond being offered. I think if you take our perspective on the cat bond market, we have
managed a small portfolio of cat bonds and we are no longer actively looking for cat
bonds with where the current pricing is.

Q - Josh Clayton Stirling

{BIO 17463087 <GO>}

Okay. Well, thank you, guys, for the time, and good luck this summer.

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Thank you. Appreciate it.

Your next question comes from the line of Vinay Misquith from Evercore.

Page 8 of 21

Date: 2014-07-30

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

FINAL

Hi, good morning. Just wanted to follow up on Josh's question. So it seems that the
property cat business now is barely a double-digit ROE. Would you say that given the
retro purchases that you've done that, yes, while it is a double-digit ROE, the risk profile is
now lower because of higher retro purchases?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Yeah. I think that's a great question, and I think one of the things we're constantly looking
at is getting the right risk mix into the book to match it against the return. We highlighted
one retro purchase, which we made, which was the Florida-specific. That materially
reduced our exposure to more frequent – the lower – the more frequent type events,
particularly in Florida.
I think the other thing to focus on is we share a lot more risk today than we have in the
past across all the different mechanisms that we have from third-party capital to tradition
ceded to other vehicles that we have in place. So I think, thinking about our book from
gross to net perspective, there's certainly a big spread between the two and it's one in
which there's significantly less risk in the net than there is in the gross, particularly
comparing to last year, highlighting the biggest change is that one Florida purchase which
materially changes the exposure to more frequent events.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Okay, that's helpful. The second thing is on pricing. We've heard that some deals have
been returned because the prices were too low. So, just trying to see if we're heading
towards the bottom, close to the bottom. I think you tried to say something about a
couple quarters ago and then last quarter, things got worse. At the risk of being wrong
again, just curious from your perspective as to where do we think we are in terms of
pricing and property cat?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
The 6/1 renewal is a very different composition than other renewals around over the
course of the year. So I think it's difficult to extrapolate what we saw in the Florida renewal
to what's going to happen to a much more diversified renewal at 1/1. I will say that absent
some surprise or some catalyst, I think it's difficult to see the direction of pricing change. I
think it's more to think about what is the magnitude of the price change. And at this point,
we're kind of going into wind season. A lot will change between now and then, but that's
the way we would position ourselves. We'll build our pro forma for the 2015 year in the
October-November timeframe, which is when we'll really get down to making estimates
as to what's going to happen with pricing going forward.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

Okay. So it seems that you're not really optimistic that pricing reached the bottom yet.

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell

Page 9 of 21



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2014-07-30

I think there – if you look at – there was resistance particularly as we got closer to the June
1 renewals, but I think whenever there's – I think markets often don't change without some
catalyst. So, whether the market flattens out or continues to decline, it's something that
remains to be seen.

FINAL

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

That's helpful. And the one last point, on the retro, I mean, you bought a lot of
retrocessional reinsurance. You've not bought back any stock. Just curious about the
capital, the excess capital position right now, and does the purchase of retro give you
additional room to manage capital? And also you have views on given where the stock
price was trading. It seems that you sort of held back on share repurchases. Would you be
open to a special dividend too?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
So let me start, then I'll turn it over to Jeff. One of the things that I think is unique about
RenaissanceRe is the way we integrate our thinking about risk in capital. So, every time we
make a decision to write a piece of business, every time we make a decision to purchase
ceded, we understand how much capital that's using and how much capital it's releasing.
So, to think that – when we purchased the retro, we do recognize we're taking risk off and
then we fully understand how that flows through into the excess capital position that we
have. Jeff ?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Yeah. I think just adding to Kevin's point on the Florida ceded purchase and what it did to
the capital position, I think you have to look at the overall book itself. So, with premium
being down as well as the Florida ceded purchase, while the Florida ceded purchase and
the reduction and exposure had the effect of increasing excess capital, if you will, the
reduced expected profit in the book has the opposite effect to some degree. But on
balance, we do see the excess capital in the portfolio having gone up in the quarter
largely as a result of the ceded purchase but offset a bit by the reduction in the expected
profit of the book.
I'd say just on the amount of excess capital, we – as I mentioned in my prepared remarks,
we think we have a fair amount of excess capital and we stand ready to buy shares at
what we think are attractive prices. As it relates to a special dividend, I think whenever we
get asked this question, we – I think our response is always, Vinay, that we look at every
option available to us to manage excess capital and that would certainly include that. And
historically, while we've repurchased – done most of our share – our capital management
via share repurchases, we have altered the capital structure as well by paying down debt
and calling preferred stock. So we do look at every available option to us and that would
include a special dividend.

Q - Vinay Misquith

{BIO 6989856 <GO>}

That's helpful. In the past, you mentioned the $300 million of excess capital number.
Would you care to update that number?

Your next question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Good morning. Thank you for taking my call. And the first question is just – if you just look
at the – have you quantified what exactly were the cat losses for the quarter?

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Cat losses for the quarter – well, yes, we have – I don't think we disclosed it. I would say at
a very high level, Kai, we had about – there weren't any major cats during the quarter. It
was really a series of small PCS (32:36) events that I think there were a total of six. On a
gross basis, it was probably around $50 million and losses on a net basis about $38 million
for the cat unit.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. Great. That's great. So if you look back for the quarter, it's relatively low-cash
quarter and you've got 11% or you're certainly below your long-term average. I just
wonder, is that because the businesses you write inherently have a lower ROE than your
hurdle rates or you just simply couldn't find enough good businesses to write that you
have an abundance of excess capital out there.

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
So, firstly, let me just be clear. The portfolio we built was based on decisions that we've
made. It wasn't due to access to business. It was based on what we saw from a pricing
environment and how we want to construct the portfolio. The first piece of the pricing
environment is gross rates are down. That's been part of the conversation throughout
2014. So with that, risk has less premium associated with it. The portfolio that we're
building is really one in which how much capital are we putting against the risk that we're
taking. And it's something that when we design that, it is based on providing an optimal
return. One of the return on equity components, which Jeff touched on, is that we're
carrying a lot of excess capital. The other piece is that we've increased the cessions we
have, both to third-party capital and to secured relationships. So it's a matter of the
portfolio construction rather than just what the price is and how that's flowing through to
return on equity.

Okay. Then just following up on that, if you – like with all the pricing and surging out there
and – so I just wonder how long do you think you need to hold on to these so-called
excess capital and just sitting there and waiting for the pricing to return or being probably
more proactive in terms of the capital management, because if you think the pricing going
to stay where it is now, you – apparently you have less available high return business to
write. Then you don't need this much of capital that you probably should think more about
buying back the stocks or somehow return – reduce your capital raise.

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
So if you look back over our historical record, we've been good stewards of managing
capital, and it's one of the primary levers in which we believe we need to manage to
achieve our long-term return objectives. And it's something that, as Jeff had mentioned,
we will continue to work on through the course of 2014. Measuring capital returns or share
buybacks in any one quarter is not the way we think about it. We think about it over the
long-term. And there'll be periods in which we are carrying more excess capital. Having
gone through the renewal and adjusting the way in which we built the portfolio added
excess capital to our portfolio, and we will continue to manage that in the quarters to
come.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs.

Q - Michael S. Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Thanks. I just had a couple questions. One on the expense side I guess, are you able to
scale down notional operating expenses on the cat reinsurance side as earned premiums
decline at least for the next six months or so? Just trying to get an understanding of the
sensitivity there. Thanks.

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Sure. Well, one of the big expenses we have is acquisition costs. So that's a variable
expense that comes in. So, obviously, that will scale with the amount of premium that
we're writing. Additionally, I think we run an organization that is – that maintains the ability
to scale up when opportunity is there, and I think that's important, and – but it is
something that when you look at the primary levers that you have to control return, it's
investment income, underwriting income, expenses, and then moving to equity. So it's
something that we're constantly looking at and trying to optimize against the environment
that we see both in the short-term and the long-term.

Q - Michael S. Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Right. But specifically, the operating expense piece, so the non-variable, I would imagine
that's mostly fixed cost. I'm just curious – I mean, are – if you scale back to, like, if this is
Page 12 of 21



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td

Date: 2014-07-30

kind of a run rate of premiums just for the near-term, should we expect the notional
number of operating expenses to stay the same, or should we expect the ratio of
operating expenses to sort of stay the same?

FINAL

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
So I think the way we would look at it is more on the notional basis rather than on the – to
make sure that we're maintaining the capabilities within the organization. I think the other
thing to look at is how much risk we're retaining and how much we're ceding. So we're not
only looking at it on a gross premium, but on net premium.

Q - Michael S. Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it. Okay. And then I guess on the top line, is it possible the Specialty or Lloyd's
businesses to sort of recapture the decline in premiums that we're seeing on the cat side,
sort of one-for-one? I mean, is – or other potential growth initiatives? I mean, is that
something that's plausible in the near-term or is that more of a headwind? Is that more a
headwind?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Sure. I think – let me start with Specialty. A lot of what we're writing in Specialty is quota
share business, and we saw increased – we did see increased opportunity, but we saw
pressure on particularly ceding commissions within that business. And the return profile
for writing that business is different than the return profile of (38:40) cat business due to
the volatility embedded in it. So I think we can – from a top-line perspective, we still have
room to continue to grow the Specialty, but it does have a different risk profile and a
return profile than cat premium.
Within Lloyd's, I think it's similar. We have more of a mix between insurance, reinsurance,
and then within reinsurance, between quota share and XOL. And I think we still have
opportunities there, but there is some headwind on pricing for the business coming into
Lloyd's as well. That's one of the reasons we're more cautious about the growth forecast
for that business unit.

Q - Michael S. Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

Got it.

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

I think I'd add that although – so I think the answer to your question, Mike, is I think there's
flexibility in both the business and even in the expense line, but those – that flexibility
comes in different timeframes. In the very short-term, there is not a lot of flexibility in
either of those, but over the longer term, there is.

Q - Michael S. Nannizzi

{BIO 15198493 <GO>}

FINAL

Great. Thanks. And I just guess thinking about where competition is coming from, is it still
sort of primarily coming from alternative vehicles? Are you seeing some of that
competition coming from other more traditional reinsurers that are maybe looking to
redeploy capital in different placements or in different geography in the stack? Just trying
to understand what are the sources of that competition at this point that you see?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
The competition is broad. So we're seeing it both from traditional and non-traditional
players. I think one of the concerns the market has is to how much new capital is truly
interested in entering the space, which is feeding a feeling among traditional reinsurers
that they need to protect market share over margin. I think within the alternative space, I
think there's pressure to deploy capital. So it's not – I wouldn't point specifically to one
area of the market or the other, but I think they're highly connected and we're seeing
competition a reasonably broad spectrum of competitors.

Your next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

Q - Jay A. Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

Thank you. First question, I think a lot of us are struggling when it comes to reinsurance
and specifically the cat market. What's potential margin or specifically the loss ratio impact
is of lower prices? Obviously, you see these big declines. You are doing things to offset
those declines, whether it's buy more retro, managing your capital. But can you say at all,
given the changes in the pricing environment, given the changes in your portfolio, what is
your loss ratio look – on an expected basis – loss ratio look like now versus, say, a year
ago?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
So I think that's one measure to think about. Really what we're trying to think about is
across the full distribution, how much capital we're using at a given point, how much –
what's the likelihood (42:17) of loss associated with that capital at a given point. So,
thinking about it as simply a loss ratio, it's – you can talk about it in a specific region or
specific line, but we think about it much more broadly across the portfolio.
I think rates are under pressure, so loss ratios are going up. But we're doing – we're
building portfolios that I think have greater diversification from some of the specialty that
we're bringing in and then changing the profile of the risk we're taking both by what we're
accepting on the inward spaces and then how we're thinking about it from a ceded
perspective. So I don't think it's as simple as just thinking about loss ratio A versus loss
ratio B.

Q - Jay A. Cohen

{BIO 1498813 <GO>}

FINAL

I understand that. Second question, the Lloyd's business, with the growth slowing there,
presumably it would continue to slow given the direction of market conditions. I guess one
of the issues with that business is the expense ratio is relatively high because you haven't
scaled up yet. I mean, slowing down the growth in that business, does that push out the
eventual decent returns you'd expect to earn in that business?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Yeah. I think it's – I'd rather trade a higher expense ratio than taking greater risk, greater
uncertainty for writing thinly or underpriced business. So it's something that, yeah, we are
prepared to be patient to continue to build that franchise so that over the long-term, it's
an industry-leading franchise within Lloyd's.

Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Byrnes from Janney Capital.

Q - Ryan Byrnes

{BIO 16902592 <GO>}

Great. Thanks for taking my questions, guys. Firstly, I just wanted to talk about your
appetite for financial – or I guess mortgage insurance or reinsuring a product. I know you
guys did a lot in the first quarter this year but just wanted to see your appetite going
forward now that there may be some new capital requirements on the primary guys?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Let me start. One of the things that when we look at lines that are written, more financialbased lines, we are very careful to make sure that there's some value that we're bringing
from the structure that we're offering. And to the extent that that we get over that hurdle,
we become interested in the line such as mortgage. I think our appetite continues to be
strong for that business assuming that we can determine that we're bringing a unique
solution compared to a straight capital market solution for the products that we're
offering.

Q - Ryan Byrnes

{BIO 16902592 <GO>}

And would your expected returns from that business be similar to the cat business for you
guys right now?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Page 15 of 21



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2014-07-30

I think there's kind of two questions in there; one is on a standalone basis and one is on a
marginal basis. Marginally, we look at that risk in conjunction of the overall risk of the
organization, including our investment portfolio. And on a marginal or on a diversified
basis, the returns on that business are very attractive.

FINAL

Q - Ryan Byrnes

{BIO 16902592 <GO>}

Okay. Great. And then just my last one, it looks like you guys are potentially an investor
with Trupanion, which had an IPO a couple of weeks ago. Just wanted to think about how
we should think about that mark running through earnings going forward. Will that be
running through operating in the third quarter or would that be run through realized gains
going forward?

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

We – thanks. We – the way we handle that is when we – when an investment prior to going
to IPO, we generally mark that through operating earnings. Once it gets to IPO and
becomes an equity security in our portfolio, it's in what we classify as equity trading, it
gets mark-to-market.

Your next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank.

Q - Josh D. Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Thank you. Mr. Cohen asked my question more eloquently than I possibly could, but I just
wanted to go one step further. With your concern, Kevin, that we might not have seen a
bottom or directionally or whatnot, to what extent do you have an appetite for taking on
the same portfolio of risk you have right now with a lower expected return?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
The way we would think about it is – I think it's difficult to say this portfolio cheaper. Is that
still acceptable? Because we'd need to think about what is the cost of the capital we're
putting against it. Is it likewise experiencing a reduction in cost? I think going forward, a
different way to ask the question is, do we feel like we're going to be positioned at 1/1 to
write a portfolio in which we'll provide adequate returns for the capital we're putting to
work. The answer to that is absolutely yes. I think the flexibility that we have is to how
much we're retaining and then all the different vehicles in which we're sharing risk is
extremely important to focus on and how we're thinking about constructing not only this
portfolio but portfolios that we'll renew at 1/1 and beyond.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Hi, thank you. I want to clarify some numbers first and then I had a question on
competition. The $38 million of sort of small PCS events in cat, can you just give us a
sense – there's always some, right? It's pretty rare there is zero, and I mean, you
obviously don't show attritional loss ratio to zero at any time. So, is $38 million sort of
normal, is it a little high, is it a lot high? Just sort of a sense of how that fares versus
expectations.

A - Jeffrey D. Kelly

{BIO 1390834 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I characterized it as I think relatively low, and I would say it's relatively low to kind of – it's
relatively low I think compared with other quarters. I think compared with second quarters
in the past, we've certainly had second quarters where it's been higher than that, but it's
actually marginally above average.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Got it. Got it. And then the – on the retro, you said it would probably be $180 million of
cover. You didn't say where it attached. Can you give us that?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Yeah. I think rather than get into specifics of a single transaction, I think what we're – the
guidance we're giving on that is it's at the more frequent return periods for Floridaspecific events.

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Got it, got it. Okay. And then just on the market, I guess I'm curious on your perceptions of
the following I guess. A lot of competitive talk about how they've bought sort of quoteunquote "cheap retro" to make up for the softening market, and yet I think you're one of
the only ones who have actually not just done that but also shrunk your top-line and
gotten off accounts. It seems a lot of others have been either flat or even grown their
top-line and said, oh, boy, we bought this cheap retro, so it's okay.
I'm just wondering how you view – A, is that sort of making the market softer? Do we
need people to actually get off gross accounts to find a bottom? And B, sort of what is
the risk in – and you guys obviously could have done that too, maybe bought more retro
Page 17 of 21



Company N ame: RenaissanceRe H oldings L td
Company Ticker: RN R US Equity
Date: 2014-07-30

to keep relationships. What's sort of the risks you're just seeing will keep the account for
distribution and retro it out?

FINAL

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Firstly, if everyone is trying to renew what they have or more, obviously that's going to
add to the supply side and pricing pressure. With regard to retro and purchasing retro, if
rates are down, in order to hold your top-line, the same, you need to write more and then
match that up against the retro. So they're growing and then buying retro against it. I think
it is potentially a strategy to think about doing that, but there's never a perfect match
between a retro and an inwards book. So one needs to think about what's the risk that's
resonant around the purchase that you're making.
I think from – thinking about different capital levers that one can pull, we have more access
to (50:58 – 50:03) just retro. So I feel comfortable with the decisions that we're making
on how we're (51:07 – 51:14) renewal or others will be something that we'll either (51:17)
provide an opportunity.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Ian J. Gutterman

{BIO 18249218 <GO>}

Got it. And then just lastly, this one might be a little more cynical, but there's been a lot of
commentary about companies rebalancing their portfolio to – this goes back to Jay's
question about the impact of lower price on margins. And again, for the strategy you guys
have been taking, I can understand it, but it seems there's a little bit of Lake Wobegon
where everyone seems to suggest that they've rebalanced their portfolio so that they're
not taking that much of a margin hit versus the headline rate cuts. Does that make sense?
I mean, is it that the traditional market's been able to do that and sort of the worst
businesses have gone to alternative markets? Or should I be more skeptical that most of
the traditional markets have been able to rebound favorably in what seems like a hard
market to do that?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
I think from our perspective, the thinking about how to build a portfolio is you need to
recognize and be honest with what's going on with the market around you. And if rates
are down, there's less premium associated with risk. I haven't seen a tremendous – I
haven't seen areas in which we've seen increasing pricing in Specialty or in Cat. So I think
thinking about adding more risk and rebalancing the portfolio without taking more net risk
is a difficult proposition to today's market.
I think if you're going to use ceded to make up the difference, you kind of have two
options. One is you need scale, because if the arb is not big, so you need to write a lot
more and then cede a lot more, hoping the spread between the two makes – captures
the lost income, or you need a very large spread in pricing between primary reinsurance
and retro. And at this point, that – we haven't see a complete dislocation between retro
and primary.

FINAL

Got it. On the gross side specifically, I mean, should I assume that there's better business
to change your gross mix too that everyone kind of would realize that and most people
would gravitate there and that's probably the more competitive business? Or are there
really pockets? I mean, obviously there's going to be mortgage insurance, but within cat,
are there pockets where maybe you think there's sort of unrecognized value that not
everyone can get access to?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
I think if you take what we did – we at 1/1, we put our guidance out and then we wrote –
the reduction that we had was less than the guidance that we've put forth because we
had an expectation that 6/1 was going to be more competitive than 1/1. It was frankly a
little bit more than we thought, but directionally, it was pretty close. So, being thoughtful
as to how you're going to position your book before the renewal is important, and I think
we did that well going into this year. So our guidance of down 15% is not far off where we
ultimately were, but we wrote it very differently, declining less at 1/1 and more at 6/1.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Brian R. Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Hey, Kevin. I'm just curious – so it looks like the industry was pretty good at holding off
changes in terms and conditions. I'm curious – and the new renewals. I'm curious, is that
your view? And then looking forward, do you think there will be continued pressure on
terms and conditions in Cat Reinsurance contracts?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
Yeah. I think if you look at what was going on in 6/1, there was – even over the course of all
of 2014, there's been different attempts to substantially increase the amount of additional
exposure put into cat contracts. Our view is additional exposure into a contract. It's just a
different way to achieve a price reduction. I think the – in general, we're reasonably
pleased with how the market held up from a terms and conditions standpoint, but I think
the pressure will continue going into the 1/1 renewal.

Q - Brian R. Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Do you think there's a possibility that maybe the actual level of rate decreases, pricing
actually subsides, but there's more push or more loosening of terms and conditions?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
I think that's always a risk. The way we think about it, we will price in any change in
exposure. I think it is an easy way, if someone is looking to have a different headline

number, is to expand coverage and keep price the same. I don't know whether that will
be a strategy. It certainly will not our strategy. We'll reflect the risk we're taking for the
price we're getting.

Q - Brian R. Meredith

{BIO 3108204 <GO>}

Got you. And the last question is, I'm just curious – you reduced your investment in DaVinci
as a new investor coming on board. What are your conversations like with third-party
capital that wants to invest with RenRe right now? I mean, are you saying, yeah, go ahead,
let's get into the business right now, or are you telling them to be cautious? And what's
demand look like from that perspective?

A - Kevin J. O'Donnell
So we have a lot of capital that has expressed interest in coming into our vehicles. And
one of the reasons they're particularly interested in our vehicles is the alignment that we
offer between the capital – our capital and their capital. So we're constantly making an
assessment as to whether we are giving them good risk or not, and that's extremely
valuable to third-party investors.

Bloomberg Transcript

We, at this point, have not actively been looking for new investors to come in, but when
we see long-term partners that we want, we will in many instances make room for them.
From a return perspective, they look at the alignment and then the ability for us to provide
a home for their capital and risk-adjusted rewards that are acceptable to them over the
long-term, and we continue to have good interest in the vehicles that we offer.
