Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter
conference call. After the market closed yesterday, we reported first quarter 2016 aftertax operating earnings of $29.9 million, or $1.06 per share. Gross written premium growth
of 9%, and overall combined ratio of 94%, and an increase in book value per share of
3.3% to $61.71 from year end 2015.

Bloomberg Transcript

Before discussing our underwriting results, I'd like to point out changes to how we report
operating income for this quarter. As we've discussed for several years, our investment
strategy is for total return. To that end, a portion of the portfolio is invested in strategies
that are expected to produce recurring gains, and while we believe that growth in book
value per share is the most important metric by which to evaluate financial performance
for our company.
Beginning this quarter, we included an alternative investment income as part of net
investment income, which we believe more accurately reflects operating earnings. For
comparative purposes, alternative investment income has been reclassified in last year's
results as well. Ironically, given the recent market volatility, the change actually had a slight
negative impact in the current quarter's operating income relative to positive impact in
the prior year's first quarter financial results.
That said, we believe that long-term reporting along these lines will allow you to more
appropriately value the company relative to others. But, again, I still believe the best
metric is the focus on growth and book value per share.
Moving on to our underwriting business, we had an encouraging start to the year with 9%
growth in overall gross written premium. Perhaps more importantly, we achieved growth in
all four of our operating segments and all four segments generated an underwriting
profit. Our ability to produce growth, despite more competitive market conditions, is the
result of the initiatives we've talked about throughout, both 2014 and 2015.
These include: identifying opportunities by business and by producers with the most
significant opportunity for profitable growth and focusing our resources on these areas;
capitalizing on the market dislocations stemming from recent M&A and restructuring
activities to bring onboard talented people and in some cases underwrite business
coming back into the marketplace; and simplifying the way we do business to improve

FINAL

efficiency and scalability, which is having a positive impact on our expense ratio and thus
our underwriting margin.
Following two consecutive years of record underwriting results for our company, we
continued the momentum in the first quarter with underwriting income of $20.7 million.
Risk selection and underwriting discipline are the most important factors driving the
improvement in our combined ratio. Our goal is to generate consistent year-over-year
improvement in 2016.
Another favorable trend that's continued in the 2016 is the consistency in our reserving
process. For the 20th consecutive quarter and the 11th consecutive year, we've seen
positive prior year reserve development.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now, let me briefly comment on first quarter 2016 results for each of our operating
segments. With continued focus, our Commercial Specialty segment has now generated
a significant improvement in the results. Overall, premium growth was up 8% in the
quarter, driven by our program, surety, professional liability, and public entity businesses.
Even more encouraging was the improvement in the combined ratio to 88% from 95.6%
in the first quarter of last year.
We achieved this improvement despite more competitive rates and pressure in the
energy sector on our mining and surety businesses. This quarter's results in Commercial
Specialty also reflects, for the first time, our U.S. professional business, which we refer to
as Argo Pro in this reporting segment. We thought it made more sense to move Argo Pro
or professional liability from our E&S segment to Commercial Specialty, given that so
much of our business is underwritten on a retail basis, which is primarily the way we
address our policyholders in other parts of Commercial Specialty.
I should also add that we're working hard to strengthen and deepen the relationships with
producers that will allow us to continue to grow in our niches within our Commercial
Specialty segment.
Moving on to Excess and Surplus Lines, gross written premium was up 5.4% year-overyear. Our casualty unit, which is our largest business by volume within E&S achieved strong
growth in excess of 16%, reflecting the benefits from our investments in technology,
overall process improvement, and focus on profitable opportunities.
Other business units such as contract and allied medical posted modest declines,
reflecting intense competition and pricing environment as well as a continuous effort to
improve the underwriting result by calling (07:48) underperforming business. On average,
rates were up modestly across this segment, property rates on the other hand has
stopped growing – going down as rapidly as in the last few years.
Turning to Syndicate 1200, gross written premiums written were up 14.2% for the quarter
year-over-year. You may recall in 2015, gross premiums written at the Syndicate were up
approximately 4%. Having said that, the primary driver of the strong growth in this year's

Page 3 of 13

Date: 2016-05-03

FINAL

quarter was in part due to timing differences on business that would otherwise have
incepted in the fourth quarter of last year.
Lloyd's remains a highly competitive market and we've reduced our participation in the
Syndicate in each of the last three years notwithstanding the growth of the Syndicate.
Within the Syndicate this quarter, we underwrote more business in property, direct and
facultative and our new business lines in marine in Asia. As you can see from our expense
ratio, which is hovering around 40%, Lloyd's is becoming an even more expensive place
to do business, as brokers continue pushing additional compensation scheme.
Lastly, gross written premiums at our International Specialty segment were up 7.2% over
the first quarter of 2015. This growth is primarily coming from our Bermuda operations,
both insurance and reinsurance. Our Bermuda insurance business is experiencing strong
renewal retention and high hit ratios, partially due to the recent M&A activity I was
referring to a minute ago in the marketplace. Rates were down modestly, but the
profitability of the book remains strong.

Bloomberg Transcript

Argo Re's results were benefiting from low cat activity and the addition of new pro rata
treaties. In Brazil, premium declined modestly due to the weakness in local currency, the
slower economy, and select changes to our underwriting appetite as this business begins
to mature. Having said that, our Brazilian operation made a profit for the second quarter in
a row, and I'm very appreciative of their efforts and success.
Returning to investment. In the first quarter of – the first quarter of 2016 began with a
complete selloff in risk assets triggered by concerns over China and a 30% decline in oil
prices. In mid-February, it's like the opposite happened. Oil began to recover and risk
assets responded to that. The S&P high-yield oil each finished the quarter up from where
they began.
Argo Group's financial statement return was 1.2%, and our total return for the quarter was
1.7%. Energy stocks and bonds began down in the corner and rallied to finish with a
positive contribution to the quarter, actively managed high-yield equities in emerging
market debt were up solidly as well, hedge funds in private equity, which are accounted
for a one month lag for our financial results detracted from our return, but beginning in
March have been strong contributors.
Reported net investment income was $21.2 million for the quarter, down from $25.7 million
in the first quarter of 2015. Included in these numbers is an alternative investment income
loss of $1.6 million relative to a gain of $4.9 million in the comparative period a year ago.
Moving on to capital management, and I say this every quarter. We had a demonstrated
track record of strong capital management for more than a decade. And in the last six
years in particular, we've returned a total of more than $452 million to shareholders. This
was accomplished through the retirement of 25% of our outstanding shares for $350
million through share purchases and $102 million paid in cash dividends.

FINAL

Our priorities remain the same. Our first use of capital is to support the balance sheet;
second is to grow our business organically; third is to have capital available for
opportunities, as they arise; and fourth is to actively return excess capital to our
shareholders in an effective manner.
In the first quarter of 2016, we repurchased 343,652 shares of stock for $19 million at an
average price of $55.32 per share, and we just reloaded our authorization to $150 million
this morning. Last quarter, we increased the dividend – the cash dividend by 10%, and this
quarter, we declared a stock dividend of 10%. We will continue to balance the return of
capital to shareholders with our priority of building the Argo franchise and shareholder
value in the long run.
In summary, I'd like to say that we're quite encouraged by our first quarter 2016 results,
which demonstrate that our key initiatives are working. We've made many necessary
competitive changes to our systems and processes, built a stronger and more focused
team, invested in technology and innovation, and introduced new platforms and products.
We will continue to improve the way our company operates.
Our investments in technology distribution and people are allowing us to serve our clients
better and faster, and we can now better select risk and manage our own portfolio mix. I
feel better about the people and our team that at any time in the past and most
important of all, these are the efforts that are driving the more consistent results that
generate more stable returns for our shareholders – we believe.

Bloomberg Transcript

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Jay Bullock.

Jay Stanley Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

Thanks, Mark, and good morning, everyone. I'll quickly provide some additional detail, and
then open it up for questions.
As Mark highlighted, we continue to have positive momentum and premium growth and
underwriting income into 2016. There are a few moving parts that I'd like to highlight that
might make the results a bit more comparable.
First, on a consolidated basis, the growth in gross written premium outpaced the growth
in net written premium. This was the result of a higher rate of growth in business, where
we've seen a much higher percentage of the risk and the effect of certain reinsurance
agreements that incept in the first quarter, for which all the ceded premium is recognized
in the quarter. The second impact will even out, as the year progresses.
As mentioned, Excess and Surplus lines and Commercial Specialty were impacted by the
movement of Argo Pro from one reporting segment to the other. It's worth noting that
even without the contribution of Argo Pro to Commercial Specialty, the underwriting result
for that segment doubled year-over-year. Of note, related to loss trends, our current
action at year continues to perform well, with a non-cat loss ratio of 55.5%, that is

Page 5 of 13



Company N ame: Argo Group I nternational H oldings L td
Company Ticker: ARGO US Equity
Date: 2016-05-03

improved from the 56.4% in the fourth quarter of 2015, and about the same as the 55.1%
in the first quarter of 2015.

FINAL

This year's first quarter accident year loss ratio includes the impact of a large energyrelated loss at the Syndicate of approximately $4 million that impacted the overall loss
ratio by about one point. In addition, the first quarter of 2016 continued our run of overall
favorable reserve development from prior accident years.
For the quarter, we experienced net favorable development of $3.2 million, about the
same as the $3.7 million in the first quarter of 2015. The largest component of this
quarter's positive development was from our E&S segment, driven by accident years 2011
and prior. As always, all of the relevant figures on loss development are displayed in the
table in the press release.
Catastrophe losses that impacted our business for the quarter were $3.3 million, again
about the same as the $3 million from the first quarter of 2015. The quarter's cat losses
were primarily due to U.S. storm activity, with the total impacted by one large claim along
with a couple small international events in our International Specialty segment.

Bloomberg Transcript

Of note, related to expenses in the quarter, the trend in our expense ratios continues to
be positive. And as we mentioned last quarter, beginning in 2016, we made certain
changes to our equity compensation program that should have the effect of lessening the
volatility related to movements in the stock price in the future. We expect these changes
to become more apparent in the quarters, where there is a significant appreciation in the
price of our stock.
Two additional items to note. Again, as mentioned, we took action this quarter to
reclassify the return on certain of our investments that are accounted for on the equity
method, from realized gain and loss to net investment income, to better reflect the
operating results of our business. And as noted, the early part of the first quarter
presented a very challenging investment environment, and some of these investments
are reported on a like basis the (16:52) results in this quarter reduced investment income
by around $1.6 million.
This change in reporting, however, better reflects our long-term strategy, which will in
most quarters reflect the positive return from these investments, and occasionally during
periods of market dislocation reflect a negative result. The inclusion of this income and
net investment income would have added $3 million of additional income in 2015, and
$19.5 million of additional income in 2014.
For the first quarter of 2016, the effective tax rate for the group was 16.2%, lower than our
standard assumption of 20%. In the quarter, the tax rate reflects earnings attributable to
the Bermuda platform, offset by taxable income in the UK that was the result of the
strengthening of sterling against the US dollar.
Finally to the balance sheet, there's a modest increase in receivables and payables that
reflects a slight reduction in our participation on the Syndicate for 2016. We ended the
Page 6 of 13

quarter with a pre-tax unrealized embedded gain of $84 million, which is relatively flat
from December 2015.
Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. And we're now ready to take questions.

FINAL

Q&A
Operator
We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Greg
Peters of Raymond James. Please go ahead.

Q - Charles Gregory Peters

{BIO 4656608 <GO>}

Good morning everyone, and thank you for hosting the call. I had just a couple of
questions for you. And I appreciate in your prepared remarks the commentary on the
difference in gross premium written versus net. But I'm curious how you think or assess
the risk that new business that you're writing today might come at a cost in terms of a
higher combined ratio relative to your renewal book?

A - Jay Stanley Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Well, Greg, that's not a new concern. I mean, anytime that you write new business, it's not
as well known to you as your renewal book, and you presume that it might run at a higher
loss ratio. I'm not sure how to answer that other than to say that, that's an issue that
we've been dealing with for decades.

Q - Charles Gregory Peters

{BIO 4656608 <GO>}

Well, considering that the market is more competitive today, I'm wondering if you've
altered your algorithm or perspective on how you're thinking about that?

A - Jay Stanley Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

No.

Q - Charles Gregory Peters

{BIO 4656608 <GO>}

Okay. And Mark, I think you highlighted the mining and surety results. And I'm wondering if
you could provide us some context on what's going in there? Reading the papers and
hearing the news about all these coal companies going into bankruptcy leads me to be
curious about how the insurance operations and surety operations behind those
businesses might perform?

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

And so, we're not involved. We don't issue that many surety bonds to coal mining
operators. In fact, I can't think of the last time, we issued one. That doesn't mean, we
didn't; I just don't recall one. Most of our risk is workers' compensation risk. And the

Page 7 of 13



Company N ame: Argo Group I nternational H oldings L td
Company Ticker: ARGO US Equity
Date: 2016-05-03

FINAL

biggest challenge for us is, as coal mining businesses shrink and/or go out of business,
there's less payroll and therefore less insurance premium.
Having said that, we have a team at Rockwood, our mining subsidiary. It does more than
just insure coal mines. They insure a number of industries that have complex risk, again,
mainly for workers' compensation. And actually if you look at the positive prior year
development that comes out of that business segment that we talk about every quarter,
about half of the positive prior year development comes from businesses other than coal
mining operations.
So, I feel pretty comfortable that Kurt Tipton and his team at Rockwood, are continuing to
transition away from coal mining operators and looking at other heavy industries to ensure
whether they can use their engineering expertise and the team that they've got to do
that. So, it will just require us to continue transitioning away from a declining market. And
of course, depending upon (22:04) White House administration we have come next year,
that may change things even more quickly.

Q - Charles Gregory Peters

{BIO 4656608 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Indeed. So, the combined ratio was 94% versus 93.6%, as you highlighted in the press
release. I think in the fourth quarter conference call or earnings call, you highlighted the
target of getting a 100 basis point improvement in 2016 versus 2015. And I'm just curious
if you've – what you're thinking about that target in the context of the first quarter results,
if it's changed your view at all?

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

No. I think that we will continue to have the – I think that in the environment that we're in,
given the changes that we've made in portfolio allocation, sorry to underwriting noninvestment, and our ability to select risk, which I think just gets better as we have more
data that we'll continue seeing improvement.
I think the challenge for us, since there are a lot of opportunities that are being presented
to us right now, and balancing our ability to take advantage of those versus putting things
on the bottom line this year, as I think both Jay and I have remarked, our expenses this
quarter were actually down, sorry, our non-acquisition expenses were actually down this
quarter year-over-year on more earned – on more premium written. So we're figuring out
how to do a little bit more with less. We plan to continue looking for ways to save money
in non-acquisition expense. But we also want to make sure that we can make proper
investments in the future as well. So I'm still focused on reducing our combined ratio, or I
should say, improving our underwriting margin and balancing that with investments in the
future.

Q - Charles Gregory Peters

{BIO 4656608 <GO>}

Perfect, thanks. Thank you for the answers.

The next question comes from Dan Farrell of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Daniel D. Farrell

{BIO 4935961 <GO>}

Hi, and good morning. Just on your other invested assets, you have about $500 million
that are in sort of hedge funds, private equity and other investments. Can you say what
percentage of those roughly are now contributing – returns are now contributing to net
investment income that's flown through operating income? And then also, can you remind
us, do you have a target return that you will do for those investments? Thank you.

A - Jay Stanley Bullock

{BIO 3644311 <GO>}

I'll answer the first part of the question, Dan, and just to try to help broader understanding
largely – in the round, it's private equity and some hedge funds and some private
investments, you can't extrapolate directly from the $500 million to the whole thing,
because in some categories, for various reasons, some are included and some aren't. A
round number to kind of have available is around $350 million. So of that $500 million,
would be generating the kind of returns that, sorry, would be classified as equity
accounted for investments and the return on those investments would be the alternative
income that we're including in net investment income.

A - Mark H. Rose

{BIO 1557365 <GO>}

Within that segment, that supports our capital appreciation portfolio and the target return
for the capital appreciation portfolio is 7%, and that's just one component of the
diversified risk portfolio.

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

Yes, keeping in mind, so that was Mark Rose, our CIO. Keeping in mind that, that many of
our hedge fund strategies are credit strategies.

Q - Daniel D. Farrell

{BIO 4935961 <GO>}

Great. Okay, thank you very much. And then one other question, you've highlighted that
one of the things that's helping growth rate now is maybe some of the market dislocation
that that we're seeing. Do you think more of the benefit for you guys is coming from
opportunities to incrementally hire talent, or is it ability to actually pick up business from
other competitors that may not be writing it, or losing it for one reason or other? Thank
you.

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

The answer is, yes.

FINAL

I think it's both. I shouldn't say, I think, I know it's both. I mean, we hired – we've hired a
number of talented people in senior roles over the last year, more than a dozen senior
roles. And a fair amount of premium, particularly in some of the larger syndicated
programs that we underwrite here in Bermuda, and to a lesser extent at the syndicate at
Lloyd's are coming our way. Oh, and also our professional liability business; Argo Pro and
our Commercial Specialty segments. So we're seeing it in three of the four segments.

Q - Daniel D. Farrell

{BIO 4935961 <GO>}

Okay, great. And then can I – if I could just sneak in one more question as well. Some of
the reinsurance buying that you're doing, is that going to have any impact on your
acquisition ratio? And how do you think about your acquisition ratio trending with lines of
business that you're writing, any mix changes taking place and obviously the context of
reinsurance? Thanks.

A - Mark H. Rose

{BIO 1557365 <GO>}

Well, we've mentioned on – over the last couple of years that we've been taking more risk
net, as we get more diversification benefit in our underwriting portfolios. We felt that
need to buy as much reinsurance. Having said that, with reinsurance pricing continuing to
decline, we've been looking at whether or not we shouldn't turn the dial back the other
way and buy a bit more and layoff a bit of risk. But on the margin, the last year, I would say
that, it really hasn't changed too much. And so, therefore, it hasn't impacted our
acquisition ratio.

Q - Daniel D. Farrell

{BIO 4935961 <GO>}

Okay, great. Thank you very much.

Operator
The next question comes from Jeff Schmitt of William Blair. Please go ahead.

Q - Jeff Schmitt

{BIO 19747235 <GO>}

Hi, good morning, everyone. The – I believe you said the casualty book within the E&S
segment was up 16%, is that right?

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

That's correct.

Q - Jeff Schmitt

{BIO 19747235 <GO>}

Could you maybe provide a little bit more color on what's driving that? Was there anything
kind of unique in the quarter or where are the pockets looking forward?

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

Well, I mean, that's been with – we've been growing at a similar rate for several quarters
now. And as I said in my remarks, it's primarily a function of changes that we've made in
Page 10 of 13



Company N ame: Argo Group I nternational H oldings L td
Company Ticker: ARGO US Equity
Date: 2016-05-03

FINAL

our business process that we think make it much easier for our clients to do business with
us, and to a lesser extent, but also important our use of technology. So we haven't
changed our risk appetite. We're just better at processing the business that's coming in
the door, or to say it in another way, we haven't widened the funnel of business
opportunities coming in and we're just doing a better job at addressing the business
that's in the funnel.

Q - Jeff Schmitt

{BIO 19747235 <GO>}

Okay. And then reserve development in the E&S segment looked to be down about half
of what it's been running at, a little bit below. Is there anything that drove that that's
unique or...?

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

No. The only thing I can tell you is, it's never the same amount in any one quarter for any
one year.

Q - Jeff Schmitt

{BIO 19747235 <GO>}

Right. I just didn't know if it was – okay. Thank you.

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. No, it's just – there was no aberration. It's – there were just never the same number.

Q - Jeff Schmitt

{BIO 19747235 <GO>}

Yes, okay. Okay, thank you.

Operator
The next question comes from Meyer Shields of KBW. Please go ahead.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Great, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Two, I guess, related questions. The underwriting
expense at a dollar amount ratio in the Syndicate and International Specialty have been
bouncing around a little bit, and the first quarter 2016 looked pretty good. Was there
anything unusual, or is this a reasonable run rate going forward?

A - Mark E. Watson

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

Well, I don't think a 40% expense ratio at the Syndicate is a reasonable run rate, which is
why I made a comment earlier about it. We are – most of that is commission expense. Our
non-acquisition expense ratio was actually pretty low. I believe, that's around 12%, but
don't hold me to that, because I don't have the numbers in front of me. But we continue
to pay – the market as a whole is continuing to pay more and more to produce business
into the Syndicate. So we need to continue looking for ways to change our mix of business
there at the Syndicate. As you can see the loss ratio is just fine. Jay did point out in his
remarks that it was a bit higher this quarter than a year ago because of – bit of loss activity
Page 11 of 13



Company N ame: Argo Group I nternational H oldings L td
Company Ticker: ARGO US Equity
Date: 2016-05-03

beyond what we would have expected. But I think that's more of a timing issue than a
change in the market, or in our portfolio.

FINAL

As for International Specialty, there are lot of different businesses within International
Specialty and I would say that our expense ratio there perhaps maybe a little unusually low
for the quarter. But I do think it's trending in the right direction as we continue to get scale
in our business in Brazil and we continue growing our business here in Bermuda.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay, that's helpful. With the casualty business rate going, are you – I'm not sure how to
ask this, are you either seeing or you're booking any different loss cost trends than you
had over the past few years?

A - Mark H. Rose

No, and that's why I was trying to make the point a minute ago in the last question that
the business that we're looking at today is the same as it was a year ago or two years
ago. We're just doing a much better job of raising our hit ratio and our close ratio on the
business that's coming in the door.

No, no, no, I understood that. I think that was clear. I'm just trying to get a handle on
whether the trends that you're seeing externally are evolving at all?

A - Mark H. Rose

{BIO 1557365 <GO>}

Yes. No, there are sitting pretty constant. Remember that we tend to focus on smaller
account business where – that we're talking about limits of a million – we're talking $1
million of limits, in some cases it's more than that, but a whole lot of what we underwrite
in that portfolio. Our policy limits of a $1 million and the premium that we're charging for
that is usually thousands of dollars perhaps $10,000 or $15,000, but not $50,000 or
$100,000. And so that portfolio has been pretty stable for several years. So rates may go
up or down, low-single digits, but we're not seeing huge changes in rates.

{BIO 20610831 <GO>}

I'd like to thank everyone for joining our call today. I know that this was a busy morning
with a lot going on. But I think that as I said in my remarks earlier that a lot of hard work
that we've been doing over the last couple of years is starting to pay off. We still have
plenty of work to do. But I think that our financial results this quarter accurately reflect
some of the progress that we've made. And we look forward to talking to you again at
the end of the second quarter. And operator that concludes our remarks for today. Thank
you.
