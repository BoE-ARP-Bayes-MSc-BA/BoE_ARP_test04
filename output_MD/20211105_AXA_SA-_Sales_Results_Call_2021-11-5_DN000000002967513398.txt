{BIO 18671460 <GO>}

Thank you and good morning everyone and welcome to AXA's conference call on our
nine months activity indicators. I'm pleased to welcome here with us this morning,
Frederic de Courtois, AXA Group Deputy CEO; and Alban de Mailly, AXA's Group CFO.
They would take you brieﬂy through the highlights of both of last night's press releases
and then they will be both happy to take your questions.
So to start things oﬀ, Frederic, I hand over to you.

Thank you, Andrew. Good morning to all and thank you for joining us for ﬁscal. I'm very
happy to be with you today, and I would like now to brieﬂy comment on the releases from
yesterday evening. Starting with the nine month activity indicators, as you've seen, AXA
delivered again a very strong performance. Total revenues increased by 7% year on year.
The growth dynamic we have seen since the start of the year is continuing across all
business lines and geographies. In particular, commercial lines revenues increased by 7%
in a continued favorable pricing environment. Our Life business remains very strong, up
plus 12% with a high quality mix. Health grew by 4%, and Asset Management performed
extremely well up 17%. Our balance sheet continues to be very strong with a Solvency II
ratio at 214%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Alban will go through the results in more detail in a moment. As you saw, we also
announced yesterday the launch of the EUR1.7 billion share buyback program, which is
expected to start around November the 8th. It reﬂects the strength of AXA's balance
sheet, notably very strong capital and liquidity positions and demonstrates the Group
ﬁnancial discipline. It is also a reﬂection of the conﬁdence we have in our business proﬁle,
strategy and prospects. On top of this, in line with our commitment during our 2020
Investor Day, we intend to launch a further share buyback program for up to EUR0.5
billion next year to oﬀset earnings dilution from the disposals announced after December
1, 2020. So disposals include Greece, Malaysia and Singapore. The Solvency II impact of
these two share buyback programs should be a reduction of roughly 6 points and 2
points respectively.
Overall I am very pleased with the performance of the Group, as we are delivering on our
strategy. The Group is growing with the very high quality mix, business mix and we remain
very focused on achieving strong technical performance. Also and very importantly we
can expect -- you can expect us to remain disciplined in terms of capital management,
including further life in-force optimization. The environment is conducive for these
transactions. And this is a strong focus for us as you know.
Thank you very much. And I now hand over to Alban.

Alban de Mailly Nesle

{BIO 20387796 <GO>}

Thank you Frederic. And good morning to all.
So I will now run you through the key ﬁgures of the release, which as you have seen are
very strong across the board. So starting with P&C. Revenues increased by 5% with a
strong performance in commercial lines up 7%. And personal line revenues were stable.
In commercial lines, we saw a strong performance in both AXA XL and in France. And if
we look at AXA XL, the price eﬀect on gross written premiums was plus 11%, reﬂecting
strong price increases on renewals, plus 15% in insurance and plus 9% in the reinsurance.
Those levels are broadly in line with the ﬁrst half of this year. This was partly oﬀset by
exposure reduction as a result of our continued portfolio re-underwriting. And overall
AXA XL revenues grew by plus 6%. France is also performing well, up 12% also from
higher volumes and favorable price eﬀects. In personal lines revenues were stable. We
are seeing good growth in non-motor across all our geographies. And in motor pricing is
fairly stable overall, which is a good achievement given the current context.

As you've seen the third quarter has been another active net CAT quarter for the industry
as a whole. We have indicated a preliminary estimate for Hurricane Ida of around EUR0.4
billion at AXA XL before tax and net of reinsurance. This corresponds to roughly 1.5%
market share for AXA XL, at the bottom end of the typical 1.5% to 2% range, and reﬂects
the impact of measures taken to reduce CAT exposure over the past years. Regarding the
European ﬂoods that we had in July, there has been some upward revision in insured loss
estimates across the industry. At AXA no change on the primary side as the higher gross
losses are covered by our reinsurance protections. But we've seen some increase at AXA
XL Re. But overall, our estimated impact remains unchanged at EUR0.4 billion before tax
and net of reinsurance.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now moving to the other lines of business. In health, revenues are up 4% with a good
performance in Group business up 5%, notably in France from higher volumes as well as
continued growth dynamics in Mexico. And in individual health, revenues are also
growing up 3% notably in Europe. Now moving to Life & Savings. So there again the
performance in Life was very strong and with a high quality business mix. On the revenue
side, Life & Savings is up 12% driven notably by France and Asia. And if you look at net
inﬂows, the business mix remained very favorable with strong inﬂows in protection at
EUR2.9 billion, unit-linked and GA capital light combined at EUR3.3 billion and outﬂows in
traditional GA savings of minus EUR4.1 billion. France continues to deliver very strong
results driven by individual savings business. We recorded strong sales in unit-linked,
notably in individual retirement and Eurocroissance capital light products.
Group business sales were also up in the third quarter notably from a large GA capital
light contract. In Asia, Japan and Hong Kong also continued to perform well with a strong
focus on a high quality mix, notably in protection and GA capital light. Finally in Asset
Management, AXA IM recorded a revenue growth of plus 17%, driven by higher
management fees, linked to favorable market conditions, strong inﬂows and an improved
business mix. In the ﬁrst nine months we recorded EUR13 billion of net inﬂows at AXA IM,
notably from third-party clients in both core and alternatives.
Now moving to Solvency II. Our Solvency II ratio stands at 214% at the end of September.
This is a very strong level and it represents an increase of two points since half year. This
improvement versus half year reﬂects a positive operating return net of accrued dividend,
slightly more favorable market conditions and a plus two point beneﬁt from our
reinsurance transaction in Hong Kong. And this was partly oﬀset by an increased exposure
in private equity.
So to conclude, the full message I want to leave you with. One, we are delivering strong
and disciplined business growth. Second, the pricing environment in P&C commercial
lines and notably at AXA XL remains attractive. Third, our life business mix is a very high
quality and we are focused on accelerating our in-force management actions. And fourth,
our balance sheet is very strong and you can expect us to remain disciplined in terms of
capital management.
So we are now happy to take your questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator

FINAL

Thank you. (Operation Instructions) The ﬁrst question comes from Peter Eliot from Kepler
Cheuvreux. Sir, please go ahead.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you very much. I had three questions please. Firstly, thank you very much for the
good news and especially on the share buyback. I was very interested in your comment
Frederic also on the sort of possible further actions in respect of life in-force actions. I'm
probably being very greedy here, but I'm just wondering whether at some point we might
-- you might look at sort of formalizing a capital management policy on back book deals
in the same way that you have on disposals, but maybe one for a later date. But I'd be
interested in your thoughts.

Bloomberg Transcript

Secondly, on the aﬀordability, you mentioned the strong solvency and cash ﬂexibility, I
mean, I guess on the cash side, you were expecting to end the year above the top of your
target range, but probably not EUR1.7 billion above. So I'm just wondering if you could
sort of update us on your thoughts now about sort of how comfortable you are being at
various points in the range or what's the other moving parts that we don't know about.
And then ﬁnally, you were quoted yesterday, I think of saying EUR1.2 billion for XL is still
achievable this year. I was just wondering if you could clarify what assumptions you -- what
that assumes in terms of sort of claims from now to the end of the year or maybe to put it
in another way, what would need to happen for you not to be able to achieve the EUR1.2
billion. Thank you very much.

A - Frederic de Courtois

{BIO 16976110 <GO>}

Thank you, Peter. I'll take the ﬁrst one and I'll leave the two following ones to Alban. So on
your question on life in-force and capital management policy. First our capital
management principles have not changed. And just to remind you what the principles
are, you remember that we have committed to compensate for the dilution of EPS in case
of disposal. And this does not include the in-force actions. And we've also committed to
benchmark and challenge any potential acquisition against a share buyback, and this
remains valid.
Sayings fees, we are committed to very high discipline in the way capital is deployed. And
I think that today's announcement is a proof of this. More speciﬁcally on in-force actions, I
conﬁrm what we have -- what we had said during the half year accounts, the environment
is good for this kind of project. And we plan to be more ambitious on this front. But of
course it takes time, you know that kind of operation usually takes 18 months to complete.
So we will see. But again, we are committed to be more ambitious on this front.

Hello, Peter. Also on your second question, on the cash, as you pointed out at half-year,
we were above the upper end of our range. Since then we've had good remittance and
we expect further good remittance by the end of the year, plus as you are fully aware, the
proceeds of some disposals, obviously the share buyback will reduce that cash amount at
the end of the year. And we will fully update you in February with the full year -- with the
full year results. But good cash position overall.
And on the EUR1.2 billion, so yes, we said that yesterday at the press conference. The
major assumption is that the fourth quarter does not include a major cap or several large
caps at AXA XL. That's the major assumptions to achieve the EUR1.2 billion overall for AXA
XL. I just want to give you an update for the Group of where we stand versus our Cat
aggregate protection. We are EUR50 million away from the attachment point of that
aggregate protection. And you will remember that there is a EUR50 million deductible, so
it would take EUR100 million cap to start biting into the Cat ag. We also remind you that
it's a EUR650 million capacity placed at 68.5%.

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

That's great. Very, very helpful. Thank you very much.

The next question comes from Andrew Sinclair from Bank of America. Sir, please go
ahead.

Q - Andrew Sinclair

{BIO 17749036 <GO>}

Morning. And thanks everyone. And as Peter said, great to see the capital return today
and (inaudible) rightly rewarded in the share price.
Three from me. Aggregate reinsurance cover, I guess I apologize if -- sorry, disposals -sorry, I mixed up. Sorry, disposals, I just wonder if you can give us an update on where we
are in the disposal processes for Malaysia, Singapore related to the buyback and also for
AXA Bank Belgium? Secondly was just on reinsurance protection, you said for the
European storms you got some reinsurance protection there. But can you give us an idea
of Hurricane Ida as well, how much protection could you see speciﬁcally on that and how
much protection remains for the European storms as well. And just on the -- thirdly just on
the exposure reductions in XL, it does feel every time we -- you report that you've reduced
the property Cat exposure further in XL, just wondering if you could give us a bit of color
on how much lower that exposure is today than when XL's was acquired and how much
further you feel you can go in that exposure reduction? Thanks.

A - Frederic de Courtois

{BIO 16976110 <GO>}

Thank you Andrew. I'll take also the ﬁrst one on disposals and let Alban on the two
following ones. So on what we have in the pipeline, on AXA Bank Belgium, we are
conﬁdent to close around year end, I mean, all signals we have are positive on that. We've
completed the dossier to the regulators. So now we are -- we are very conﬁdent that we
will close -- we will close around year-end. On Singapore, Singapore the closing process
Page 5 of 18



Company Name: AXA SA

Date: 2021-11-05

should go fast, I would say, forecast also something around year-end. On Malaysia, it's
always slower. So our best estimate is Q2 next year, again with a bit of uncertainty. But
again, at this stage on this three closing, there is no worrying signal. And again, the good
news is that an AXA Bank Belgium all signals are positive now.

FINAL

A - Alban de Mailly Nesle

{BIO 20387796 <GO>}

So on your questions on the reinsurance protections on European ﬂoods and Ida. The way
it works on the insurance side, so that would cover AXA Germany, AXA Belgium and AXA
XL insurance exposures in Europe, we are protected from EUR350 million on, and for
capacity of EUR1.2 billion, which means that, we are now clearly above the EUR350 million
loss on the primary side for those ﬂoods. And therefore are covered for any deviation.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the reinsurance side, we don't beneﬁt from the same, and therefore that's why we
slightly increased our assessment of our loss on the reinsurance because then we don't
have the same excess of loss cover. On Ida it's mainly the -- it's mainly AXA XL Re, which is
aﬀected by Ida. And with the same sort of protections we have some quota shares with XL
Re. But we don't beneﬁt from an excess of loss protection. Overall if there is a new event,
as I said in one of the ﬁrst questions, the, I mean the whole Group, including XL Re would
be protected by the Cat ag provided that the -- that loss from a new Cat reaches EUR100
million.
On property Cat at XL, we have reduced by 40% our XL Re exposure since we bought XL
on Cats. Now we are looking at the end of the year to determine, I mean, what we want to
do with our exposure for next year. And that will highly depend on the price increases that
we will see. We still believe that Cat are not adequately priced on the reinsurance
markets. And if we don't see a signiﬁcant increase in prices, we can reduce further our
exposure at XL Re.

Q - Andrew Sinclair

{BIO 17749036 <GO>}

Sure helpful. Thank you very much.

The next question comes from Michael Huttner from Berenberg. Sir, please go ahead.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 21454754 <GO>}

Good morning. Thank you very much and congratulations for such lovely news. And
everything lovely here. And I had just a little question, so on the buyback, I think you said
many times disciplined capital management et cetera. But is this a one-oﬀ, this huge
number, EUR1.7 billion, or is there a kind of thinking that you could do more there? On the
Life deals, can you give any kind of clue or hint what reasons or what size we might be
looking at? And then on the -- on COVID, you -- or I think AXA XL released EUR600
million at the half-year reserves, and I think you don't look at reserves at the nine-month
stage but you must have some kind of thinking. Is there -- given how COVID claims in P&C
are kind of running oﬀ, is there room for more releases at some stage? And my last

Page 6 of 18

question -- and really great [ph] to hear is indeed 214%. What is the number of the
operating capital generation? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Frederic de Courtois

{BIO 16976110 <GO>}

Thank you, Michael. I'll take the ﬁrst one and I'll give Alban on the three following ones.
On the ﬁrst one, I cannot say more than what I've said. We will stay very disciplined, and
again, the -- today's announcement or yesterday's announcement is a proof that we are
disciplined. And I can assure you that we will stay very disciplined.

A - Alban de Mailly Nesle

{BIO 20387796 <GO>}

On your Life -- on your question on Life transactions, what we have in mind, as you
remember, we have EUR280 billion of GA account -- general account reserves. We have in
mind to cede EUR30 billion to EUR50 billion of reserves through reinsurance or through
sales of books, that's the target we have set ourselves. On XL, so we will review the
COVID reserves at the end of the year. That part of the equation for the 1.2, but it's a bit
too early for me to say what will be the outcome on this. And the 214% solvency, there was
1 point of operating return this quarter, so slightly less than the usual 2 points and that's
because of the Cat in Q3.

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 21454754 <GO>}

Brilliant. Thank you.

The next question comes from William Hawkins from KBW. Sir, please go ahead.

Q - William Hawkins

{BIO 1822411 <GO>}

Hi, gentlemen. Thanks very much. A very simple boring question, ﬁrst of all. Can you tell
us the own funds and SCR behind the 214% please? Secondly, has the adverse
development cover for XL attached by the end of September? I mean, I think you're
booking that quarterly for Enstar. So I am intrigued to know whether that's attached, and if
it hasn't attached, what's the probability of it attaching by the end of this year?
And then lastly, could you just give us any kind of headlines you want to in terms of what's
going on with claims inﬂation? Are there any hot spots that are emerging that you think
we should know about? And also, again I'm sorry, it's a slightly woolly question, but how
do you want to continue to think about this, because you open up the newspapers and
they are just full of inﬂation everywhere. You talk to every insurance company and it's like
they are living in a diﬀerent universe, and I appreciate you're on top of all of these risks
and you're thinking about them, but to me there's a real disconnect that I'm trying to get
my head around. So are there any hot spots in claims inﬂation and how should we be
thinking about the disconnect between worries in the papers, no worries in the industry?
Thank you.

A - Alban de Mailly Nesle

FINAL

So on the 214%, the denominator, the SCR is EUR28.8 billion. And for the numerator is this
times 2.14. On the ADC, so we do through reserves reviews twice a year and it will take
place in Q4. So at this stage, there is no change to the ADC and therefore, it hasn't bitten
into the ADC at Q3.
On inﬂation, so a few things. One, claims inﬂation is something that we've had almost
forever. What I mean by this is, when you look for instance at motor insurance and spare
parts, notably because there is a lot more of electronic parts in cars and in the way the
cars are built, there has been spare parts inﬂation in motor insurance and we've managed
through that by better procurement, by negotiations and so on. And we embed in our
pricing in, in our reserving, this -- these assumptions of inﬂation. So I agree with you, there
is a surge in general inﬂation now, but it doesn't mean that that surge in general inﬂation
triggers additional inﬂation in our businesses in -- for instance, in spare parts. It might, but
it's not absolutely obvious that it will, but we are vigilant about this as you can imagine. So
we will take that into account in our pricing in our reserving, but for the time being our
thesis is that it is a temporary surge linked to the economic recovery and the bottlenecks
that come with it. And we will review that periodically. And notably, I think a good
moment to look at that, it's probably at the end of Q1 or Q2 next year, when normally that
temporary inﬂation should have faded. But as I said, it's part of our normal pricing and
reserving process.

The next question comes from Dominic O'Mahony from Exane BNP Paribas. Sir, please go
ahead.

Q - Dominic O'Mahony
Hi, folks. Thank you for taking our questions. Three from me, if that's all right. Just ﬁrstly
on asset management. I think the implication of the statements you made is that the Oaks
[ph] business is growing well. I wonder if you could give us any more color on that, what
sorts of asset classes you're growing and really what this means for fees and indeed
whether this is third-party internal [ph] or mix, and indeed whether that means that the
revenue margins -- sorry, the investment margins you get on the Life side, actually you
might be beneﬁting from that? And second question, Asia high potentials, growth is sort
of -- is actually a little bit behind where rest of the Group seems to be. I'm aware that there
is a negative in health in China from the non-repeat of a digital partnership. I'm just
curious to hear your views on where the Asia ex-Japan growth comes from going
forwards and what your sort of direction of travel is?
A third question on France. Life growth is very strong. I'm just trying to work out whether
this is in some sense a rebound from the pandemic eﬀects, or were there actually the sort
of the newer products, the retirement products, newer car insurance [ph] products,
whether actually there's structural growth there, which means that actually we should be
expecting signiﬁcant growth sort of ahead of historic trend going forwards? Thank you.

A - Frederic de Courtois

{BIO 16976110 <GO>}

So I think you Dominic. On asset management, so Alts is eﬀectively growing, but core is
also growing if you adjust for the issue that we have created ourselves. What I mean by
this is with the Hong Kong transaction there are EUR5 billion of general account assets
and therefore, EUR5 billion of assets with AXA IM that have -- that we have lost. So we
need to adjust for that to see the performance of AXA IM as such. But at Alts, it's growing
on the two main pillars that are structured ﬁnance and real assets. For the nine months
2021, structured ﬁnance grew AUM by EUR2.8 billion and real assets by 5.7, and that's
both coming from AXA and third-parties.
On high potentials in Asia, I think we have China on one hand and we have Southeast
Asia on the other hand. On China, there has been two changes in regulations in the last
month that have aﬀected the insurance market in China. The ﬁrst one that we already
discussed is on the -- on motor and there has been deregulation and that deregulation
has led to a signiﬁcant increase in combined ratio. We believe that we are probably in a
better shape than many of our peers there, but nevertheless, we need to focus on
proﬁtability and therefore, it leads us to reduce our exposure in motor in China, to focus
on the proﬁtable segments.

Bloomberg Transcript

The other change in regulation came on the digital platform, selling health business,
where the way it is sold is -- has been made more stringent by the regulator. So that also
has an impact on the -- on China health. We are focusing obviously on other distribution
channels, notably our branch network that has in the past focused on motor and that we
are moving also to health that we have sound growth in health in China.
On the Southeast Asia businesses, there is growth, but I will just remind you that the -those companies are accounted for under the equity method and therefore the revenues
are not highly visible, but there is good growth in Southeast Asia, nevertheless, and
notably the APE, which as you know, takes into account our quota share of those
companies, the APE are up 11% on our high potentials.
Then on your last question in France, I would say there are -- I mean there is good growth,
as you saw, both in P&C commercial lines and in Life. I P&C commercial lines we
beneﬁted from very good commercial dynamic, also from the fact that there is an
economic recovery and that part of our revenues are based on our own customers'
revenues. And there is the third aspect, is the fact that on average prices increased were
3% in France. So it's a rebound, we shouldn't expect such a growth in the coming
quarters, but the level itself is sustainable.
On the Life side, I think it's a bit of both. We have a rebound simply because there was a
lot of savings accumulated by our customers last year under the COVID period, and now
those savings ﬁnd their way to our life policies, notably unit-linked and Eurocroissance
and retirement products. In that sense, there is a catch-up, but we believe that we have a
very good distribution network in France to sell those products, and that there is a very
good environment, notably a very good tax environment to incentivize our customers to
take that kind of product. So we believe that there will be further growth in that business
going forward. I would only add that in France the growth on savings is a very high-quality
Page 9 of 18



Company Name: AXA SA
Company Ticker: CS FP Equity
Date: 2021-11-05

growth because we have a share of 55% of unit-linked and Eurocroissance which is still
very much above the market, I think around 14 points above the market. So there is
growth, but there is also quality of the growth.

The next question comes from Andrew Crean from Autonomous Research. Sir, please go
ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Andrew Crean

{BIO 16513202 <GO>}

Good morning, everyone. I had three questions, if I may. Firstly, could you give us any
thoughts about the renewal of your aggregate cover for next year, as to whether you'll be
able to get 100% cover rather than 68.5%? Secondly, you are talking about the Life inforce optimization. If you do deals there, you could either do them by a reinsurance
contract or you could do it by disposal, both of them achieve the capital now, but the loss
of future earnings. If you do it by disposal, you say that you return the capital to
shareholders, but if you do it by a reinsurance contract you weren't. What is the logical
consistency in that thinking? And then, thirdly, in terms of your capital management, I
mean, you've obviously dealt with the issue of disposals and you've dealt with the issue of
testing acquisitions against the beneﬁt from a buyback. But the elephant in the room
remains the fact that you're going to be generating 18 to 22 points of operating capital
generation, less 12 points of dividends, gives you anywhere around eight points of
organic capital generation every year, which is about EUR2.3 billion, and you don't seem
to want to tell us what you will do with the excess. Why is that and what should we
conclude?

A - Alban de Mailly Nesle

{BIO 20387796 <GO>}

So on the aggregate cover -- and thank you Andrew for your questions. We are, as we
speak, in the process of designing a program for next year and fundamentally where we
want to go is in -- as far as our risk appetite is concerned, is risk appetite that would be ﬂat
or reduced. We don't want to increase it in terms of Nat Cat. Given what I said earlier on
the reinsurance market and the fact that we will -- or not reduce our exposure on XL Re
depending on the prices we get, we will see whether -- I mean we will see how we want to
structure our reinsurance program between the various tools that we have, quota shares,
sidecars, excess of loss and aggregates. The -- at this stage, I really cannot say whether we
will buy an aggregate and how much. What we see, what we hear from the market is that
the rate for [ph] market is hardening and that will be probably more expensive. So we
need to manage our risk appetite probably down but not sure yet at this stage, but we
also need to manage our earnings, and so we'll see what's the best mix between all these
four tools that we use. So sorry, not to be able to give you a better answer, but that's
where we -- exactly where we are today.

FINAL

Andrew, on your two next questions. So the ﬁrst on life in-force, you are right, that when
we are doing this kind of operation, in fact, we have three options; reinsurance, sale of a
portfolio or sale of a company. And as I said, we are going to accelerate on this, and
generally speaking, we prefer to do disposals -- company disposals or portfolio disposals
for all the reasons you can imagine. Seeing this, our commitment to do share buyback
and to compensate for the dilution does not include the life in-force actions, I mean, be it
reinsurance or disposals.
On your last question on the elephant in the room, as you call it, ﬁrst, on this, I would say
this is not big news, but the company has always three options to invest its capital. We can
either do internal growth, we can do M&A or we can do share buyback. We want to grow
through internal growth, we have many options to grow through internal growth, and we
are keen to have growth on our pressured business lines. On M&A, we do not exclude to
do M&A. As we've already said, we are going to do M&A in a very disciplined way. This
will be bolton M&A, this will be acquisitions in businesses we like and in geographies
where we already are seeing that opportunities currently are scarce, the prices are high,
so we will see. And then we have share buyback. The only thing that I can tell you is that
we will stay very disciplined and we will always give priority to the value creation and to
our shareholders.

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Thank you and good morning everybody. My ﬁrst question is around -- again on the Life
in-force transactions, and thanks for the EUR30 billion to EUR50 billion target or a number
that you gave us. And then just interested to know how you think about the free cash ﬂow
conversion, because I think by 2023 you're talking about EUR5 billion to EUR6 billion of
remittances. The cash conversion or IFRS earnings is quite low. So when you think about
seeding those potential reserves, then is that a -- is that a stock issue, something that just
helps the Solvency II at Group level or is there an ongoing beneﬁt that's possible in order
to help improve that cash conversion, which I think is dragged down mostly by Asia Life.
And if you're able to tell me the capital that's allocated to that EUR30 billion to EUR50
billion of GA reserves that would be very helpful, please.
And secondly on XL. So the EUR1.2 billion for this year, which looks like will be more or
less met, obviously next year we should start to see some more exposure growth and yes,
obviously, the beneﬁt from raised [ph] earnings through. Can you just comment on what
you see the outlook for earnings for XL going into 2022, please? I'm also keen to get a
view around the ROE of that division and any thoughts around the global minimum tax
rate and what a normalized tax rate should be for XL, please. And then ﬁnal question just
around the dividends. So, obviously, where we see today the buyback, I mean, essentially
out of the catch-up from the second tranche of the 2019 dividend that wasn't paid. When

it comes to thinking about the 2021 dividends, should we be thinking that you're looking
at some kind of catch-up still, because the 2020 dividend was ﬂat versus 2019? I know the
payout ratio went up because the earnings came down, but nevertheless, it was ﬂat. So
when it comes to 2021, are we looking at some kind of catch-up? And you did move up
the payout ratios a couple of years, in fact, three years ago now, but you haven't actually
made a move on moving up that -- the underlying payout ratio towards the mid-point,
let's say. Thank you very much.

A - Alban de Mailly Nesle

{BIO 20387796 <GO>}

So on the in-force transactions, I think you are right -- you said it rightly. The purpose of
these transactions is to transform capital, which is in our in-force books and therefore not
liquid, into cash at the holding company level. So it's not about the Group solvency -might help with the Group solvency, obviously, but the idea is to align better the Group
solvency and the cash that we have at the holding company. That's the purpose of this.
On the capital that backs those books, it really depends on the books. So at this stage, we
are looking at diﬀerent countries, diﬀerent books and so it's a bit diﬃcult to give you an
overall number.

Bloomberg Transcript

On XL, so we will not give guidance for XL for '22. What I'll just say is that XL like any other
company in the Group needs to take its share of the growth in earnings that we want to
have within the Group.
The ROE, as we see it, in the way we allocate capital to the entities is when XL is at EUR1.2
billion, between 14% and 15% of the capital allocated. On the global tax rate, what I
suggest is that we come back to you with full-year earnings because we'll probably know
a bit more then on the way it works, because we have a view on the 15% that will apply in
number of jurisdictions that today are below. Ireland has moved up, Bermuda, Hong Kong
and so on. But there is still a number of question marks on the basis to which those 15%
will apply and how it will be calculated. So it's too early for me yet to say how much it
would cost us.

A - Frederic de Courtois

{BIO 16976110 <GO>}

And on the dividend, the only thing that I can tell you is that we stick to our dividend
policy and we want to achieve progressive and regular growth of our dividend in line with
the earnings growth.

FINAL

Good morning. And it is quite an appropriate time to be asking my questions, because
the ﬁrst question I had was in relation to the 3% to 7% per annum earnings per share
growth guidance that you talked about a couple of years ago. Does this -- is there
anything here? I mean obviously the share buybacks that you are talking about should
circa 3% earnings per share. So I'm wondering if there's anything here that then stops you
pushing up towards the 7% level on a per annum basis.
And then the second question I've got is on the cumulative dividend target that you set. I
think between '21 and '23 you were targeting EUR11 billion of dividends. Does this EUR1.7
billion count towards that target, or should we consider it as separate?

A - Alban de Mailly Nesle

{BIO 20387796 <GO>}

So on the 3% to 7% EPS target that we've given ourselves, so obviously, the share
buyback will help and we are, therefore, conﬁdent in our ability to be within that range.
And you've seen for -- until H1 this year where we are, but as I said, we are conﬁdent in our
ability to achieve that range.
On the dividend target, we have not given EUR11 billion target for dividend. The target we
gave ourselves was more on the remittance from the entities, which was EUR14 billion
during the plan period. So there is no change, because there is no target as such, and we
plan to apply our dividend policy as stated, irrespective of the share buyback.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Oliver Steel

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

I hesitate to challenge you on that, but I'm fairly sure when you set the cash roll forward
targets for 2021 to 2023, the dividend -- the dividends were cited as being EUR11 billion.

A - Alban de Mailly Nesle

{BIO 20387796 <GO>}

No, you're right, but it was -- and sorry if there was a confusion. That was indicative and as
opposed to the EUR14 billion remittance that we stated from the entities that is a target for
us. So -- but irrespective of that, again, the dividend should be considered with our
dividend policy and irrespective of the share buyback.

Q - Oliver Steel

{BIO 6068696 <GO>}

Okay. So we should be -- eﬀectively we should go with the payout ratios being the sort of
the main [ph] guidance?

A - Alban de Mailly Nesle

{BIO 20387796 <GO>}

Yes, absolutely.

FINAL

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Hi, good morning everyone. Two questions left on my side. The ﬁrst one would be
regarding the Group risk appetite. It's likely that the reinsurance protection is going to -are going to be more expensive into next year. You've got strong solvency ratio, actually
you are highlighting that you're willing to take slightly more risk on the asset side. I was
wondering what's your view regarding taking more liability risk or I mean volatility risk in
you balance sheet at the present. I mean, more a theoretical [ph] question to understand
how you will approach potential -- potentially higher prices for reinsurance cover into
2022.
The second question would be related to Health in France. Maybe this is a highly political
question, but there are some, I mean, projects to somewhat nationalize French health
insurance in the context of the French presidential elections. What's the risk of this -- of
such a plan taking place? I mean have you got a feel or any comment on that side of
things? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alban de Mailly Nesle

{BIO 20387796 <GO>}

So thank you, Thomas for your questions. On the Group risk appetite, we are not great
fans of volatility. What we want to do is to grow our business, ﬁrst, with the condition that
it's proﬁtable and second, that it doesn't bring too much volatility. That's exactly what
we've been doing at AXA XL, where we have, as you know, reduced the line sizes on the
number of lines of business and we have increased prices to reach the cost of capital or
better in all our lines of business. And we will not move away from that philosophy.
As far as Cat is concerned, we are both long and short Cat risk. So on the XL Re side, we
don't want to increase our exposure, that's for sure. But we will adjust our exposure,
depending on the price increases that we see, or don't see this year. And on the
protections that we buy, again, we will not increase our risk appetite to Cat. We will -depending on the prices that we see, either by more protections or not. And if we cannot
buy more protection, we will reduce our primary exposure, notably on the reinsurance
side. But that's the equation that we have to resolve these days with, clearly, prices that
are up on the reinsurance and retro market, but to what extent that's still the question.

A - Frederic de Courtois

{BIO 16976110 <GO>}

On your Health question in France, my ﬁrst comment is that these are no more preelection discussions. Based on a whole survey that have been done, what we can see is
that both clients and doctors like very much the current system. They like it because that's
a high-quality system and they like it also because this is not a two-speed system as it may
exist in other countries. So seeing this, we do not say it cannot be improved and we are
very open to discuss about potential improvement, but we are convinced that globally the
systems works well, and again not only insurance companies are saying it but the client
and doctors.

FINAL

Q - Louise Miles

{BIO 20765435 <GO>}

Hi, there, good morning. Just a couple of questions from me, please. So on AXA XL Re,
there has been a (inaudible) news ﬂow on this division lately. How -- can you just remind
us how important this business is for you strategically? And I think at the ﬁrst-half earnings,
you mentioned that there is a possibility for you to further reduce your equity hedging.
Did you actually end up doing anything on that in the third quarter and are you still
thinking of doing being more here the rest of the year and into 2022? And then ﬁnally,
you mentioned also at the ﬁrst half that you're expecting pricing at XL to be -- to occur at
a slower pace going forward. I mean if I look at the release, it doesn't really look like that
was the case in the third quarter. Can you just give us a very quick overview of where you - when you expect pricing to slow down at XL? Thanks.

A - Alban de Mailly Nesle

{BIO 20387796 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So, XL Re is an important business for us, it allows us to diversify our exposure, notably on
Net Cat because it gives us access to some payrolls [ph] that complement our portfolio
usefully, and therefore, give us better diversiﬁcation, and it allows us also to have access
to some P&C markets that -- in which we are not, and then for some of which we have
exited in the last month and years. So it is an important business.
On the equity hedging, we have not reduced equity hedging, but as you may have
noticed, we have decided to invest, so to speak, 2 points of solvency in private equity
investments. So overall, that increases our equity exposures, but we prefer doing that
through a private equity investment rather than through a reduction in equity hedges. In
2022, we'll see, it will depend on market movements.
And sorry, on -- yeah, on pricing at XL, so we see very strong price increases in some
lines. Just to mention a few, for instance, cyber is up 71%. The international lines are up
42%. So there are some lines that needed that kind of price increases and we are pushing
for those increases to restore proﬁtability. And going forward, we believe that '22 should
still see overall price increases, but not to the tune that -- what we've seen over the last 18
months, that should -- that should slow down, but nevertheless remain positive.

I'm very lucky. I'll keep it really brief. Thank you very much. And on motor, a colleague had

So the period of higher car -- higher car is incredibly expensive, is not a few days, it's
more like three weeks. I just wonder if that's in your numbers already, in your thinking.

FINAL

And the second is, you made these lovely new commitments on the ESG on October 28,
which is wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. I just wonder, is there a cost to this, or how do
you think -- how do we think of it in terms of money?

Q - Peter Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

So, Michael, sorry, the line was bad on the ﬁrst question, can you just repeat it? I got the
second one (multiple speakers).

Q - Michael Huttner

{BIO 21454754 <GO>}

Yeah. Sorry about that. I was just saying is the cost of motor claims insurance going up
because it's not the cost of the spare parts, but the delay in getting them and while there
is a delay, then the policyholder gets a higher car and that's expensive a bit.

A - Frederic de Courtois

{BIO 16976110 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

From -- so from what we see there are two sources of inﬂation in car claims. One is the
spare parts as such, and second is the cost of labor that might also increase, given what
we see in some areas about labor shortage. That's not certain, but you start seeing that.
The spare part component is more important. So it's really those two.
On ESG, so as you saw, we tightened our rules in terms of investments and in terms of
underwriting. But on the underwriting side, we have said that, I mean our philosophy is
not to stop doing business, is to help and encourage the oil and gas companies to
embrace the transition. So we are giving ourselves 2022 to talk to those companies, and
2023 also to give them a chance to move away from the non-conventional oil production
or to exploration in greenﬁeld in a number of places, as you saw in the press release. And
then we'll see. What I can tell you is that energy overall, so it's mostly done at XL, and it
represents probably 2% of our overall P&C premiums. So we will see in '22, '23, rather '23,
the nature of the business we will do with that -- those oil and gas companies.

Q - Dominic O'Mahony
Apologies, classic mute ever. Frederic, when you were talking about the uses of excess
capital, you mentioned the organic growth, M&A and buyback. What you didn't answer
that list was debt reduction either -- either external debt or internal debt. I wonder
whether that might be part of your toolbox or whether actually you're saying that's
Page 16 of 18



Company Name: AXA SA

Date: 2021-11-05

probably unlikely. (Inaudible) the question is if you do major Life in-force actions there
could be quite a signiﬁcant change in the capital that might in turn impact your leverage
ratios. I'm just wondering whether that's -- whether I'm barking up the wrong tree or
whether that's something you're thinking about? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Frederic de Courtois

{BIO 16976110 <GO>}

Now, thank you. On this, you're correct that this is part of the toolbox, especially from a
cash point of view. Saying this, we have a very clear policy on leverage and we stick to this
during our plan, so there is no news on this.

Q - Dominic O'Mahony
Okay, thank you.

Operator
The next question comes from James Shuck from Citi. Sir, please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - James Shuck

{BIO 3680082 <GO>}

Thanks for taking my follow-up. Just quickly on AXA XL, I think you mentioned 14% to 15%
return on allocated capital, based oﬀ the EUR1.2 billion. That looks like there's only EUR8
billion of allocated capital in XL. That looks a very low number given there's EUR20 billion
of revenues at XL. So just any comment to that level of capitalization and capital -- how
you actually allocate capital for that business would be helpful. And then secondly, just on
the -- I mean, the tax rate at XL has moved around quite a lot. The 1.2 guidance for this
year, I mean what's a normal tax rate for XL, please, obviously subject to the GMC, which
might change that, just anything [ph] helpful on that?
And then ﬁnally, just returning to the point about the cash remittances. So I understand
the Life in-force transactions which are looking to redistribute some of that liquidity back
to holdco. It's the ongoing cash remittances that look like -- the EUR5 billion to EUR6
billion in relation to IFRS earnings, which seems to stem from Asia. So just any thoughts
about how you can improve that cash conversion on IFRS earnings on an ongoing basis,
please. Thank you.

A - Alban de Mailly Nesle

{BIO 20387796 <GO>}

So on the ROE at XL, the way we allocate capital is a function of the SCR used by each
company in each line of business. The fact that -- you know that P&C risk diversiﬁes
extremely well, simply because you don't have the same losses, the same issues on
reserves, premiums at XL in a given geography and in France or wherever else. So the
amount of capital that XL uses, seen from Group standpoint, is not that high, and you
have the detail of the breakdown in the appendices that we give. And that's the beauty of
the P&C business, or the health business as opposed to savings, where on the savings
part you have a lot of ﬁnancial risks and those ﬁnancial risks do not diversify well, rather
they accumulate, because when you have a global crisis, it will aﬀect all asset classes at
the same time, everywhere. So that's very important to keep in mind when we think about

Page 17 of 18



Company Name: AXA SA
Company Ticker: CS FP Equity
Date: 2021-11-05

our businesses and the way we allocate capital. On the tax rate at XL, I would say it's
around 15%.

FINAL

A - Frederic de Courtois

{BIO 16976110 <GO>}

On your last question on cash conversion and the EUR14 billion. So, ﬁrst, the EUR14 billion
already included some management actions. Saying this, we have more appetite on inforce, so we will see what happens. Again, on in-force, there is always an execution risk,
then there is a time lag and so on, but clearly, we have more appetite on in-force. What
can we do to further improve this cash conversion? Our cash conversion is very high,
especially from the European countries. On countries with a lower cash conversion, so we
have historically XL, which is directly linked to the XL results, and as we've said, we are
conﬁdent that XL is strongly improving and will continue to improve, so, I will say, solving
the result issue, we solve also the remittance to peak. Then we have the two spots of
Hong Kong and Japan. We are working hard on this. I mean the transaction in Hong Kong
was part of the solution. Japan, the remittance in Japan is improving strongly and
regularly. So we are very focused on these three areas. So, XL, Japan and Hong Kong, and
we are conﬁdent that we can continue to improve the remittance from them and we have
the relevant actions in the pipeline on this.
