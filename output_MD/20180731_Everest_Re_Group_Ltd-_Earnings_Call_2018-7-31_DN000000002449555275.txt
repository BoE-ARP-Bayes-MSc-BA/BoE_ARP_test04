Thank you. Good morning, and thanks for joining our call this morning. The second quarter
of 2018 was a decidedly mixed quarter for Everest. Surely the bottom line results were
not where we wanted them to be, driven by the reserve charge we pre-announced.
Nonetheless, it was another quarter of a successful execution of our strategy.

We had a lot of success executing on the opportunities that have been presented to us in
the market. We are seeing strong premium growth both in our insurance and reinsurance
business. Plus, in both segments, our underwriting and re-underwriting actions have driven
improvements in the attritional loss ratio and the profit margins embedded in our
portfolio. Of course, the progress towards our strategic objective is masked by the
reserve charge. No doubt, this adjustment was disappointing. And while it reflects some
broader underlying trends going on in the market, in reality, we know it will require us to
improve and make changes to recognize these trends.
The underlying cause of the reserve shortfall can be attributed to two factors, which were
not apparent to us at year-end. First, our clients are seeing a large number of reopened
claims, largely stemming from the AOB threat in Florida. Ceding companies were trying to
settle claims quickly, conceivably to mitigate the AOB issue.

Bloomberg Transcript

The loss reports we received from clients showed a high percentage of closed claims
very clearly and we were encouraged by these reports. Settling claims quickly was initially
a sound strategy, but what we now know is that, this approach left our clients vulnerable
when the actual repair bills came in higher than what they originally closed in their claim.
To a lesser extent but for the same reasons, the claims reopening has impacted Puerto
Rico after Maria as well, driving up losses which crystallized in the second quarter. The
reality was that these closed claims statistics we were seeing were a false [ph] positive.
The second factor was the extraordinary rise relative to past events in loss adjustment
expenses. The expense numbers we're seeing are significantly above our historical data.
In fact, we saw some treaties experience high-30's and even 40% expense loss. Again,
these numbers are only began to emerge in the second quarter of claims reports. Both of
these factors reopened claims in a much higher than expected LAE with the
overwhelming reasons for the increases we saw.
Our reserves at year-end for our core reinsurance cat portfolio contemplated demand
surge but these developments were beyond anything seen before. In addition, when
coupled with the California wildfires, it had a leveraged impact on our aggregate retro
book. I would refer to this as the cliff [ph] factor. In other words, our previous analysis at
many of our clients' retro accounts, not attaching. Now, some are very much in the money.
So while these are the observations, it demands that we respond to what may be the
new normal. Going forward, cat pricing will need to reflect the higher level of loss
adjustment expenses, particularly for those accounts they rely heavily on third-party
adjustment services. While some of the LAE level was driven by scarcity of resources due
to multiple, almost simultaneous events, for example, citizens doubled their standard
adjusted fees due to the shortage created by Hurricane Harvey. Our pricing needs to
better consider this new reality. Plus, our reserving process going forward needs to be
refined to consider these factors in multiple events, as seen in 2017.
This commentary have just gone through or hopefully clarified the circumstances and our
recognition that we need to respond appropriately to changing market conditions.
However, while we did temporarily get the score-keeping wrong, make no mistake that

FINAL

we are playing the game at a high level and we'll continue to do so. Our profits from our
cat portfolio were 3.5 billion over the last five years. This business comes with volatility but
the appropriate reward for the risk is evident.
Finally, given the extraordinary circumstances of the 2017 cats and the separate process
we use in setting cat reserves versus non-cat reserves, our review of our current reserves
finds no read-across on the adequacy of our non-cat reserves. We are very comfortable
that our track record of conservatively setting our non-cat reserves continues.
While these catastrophes obviously the conversation, I would reiterate that other key
parts of the organization are doing excellent and the attritional results are reflective of
that. It is critical, the continued improvement is adding profitable diversification to our
portfolio. The reinsurance portfolio has seen continued growth in mortgage and other
credit-related business, as well as a revival of our casualty book where pricing has
improved considerably, allowing us to entertain more deals.

Bloomberg Transcript

Overall, reinsurance premiums earned have risen almost 30% in the first half of the year
to $2.5 billion with an attritional combined ratio of 81.7%. This is an encouraging result as
we move into the second half. The improvements in the attritional results reflect the trend
we noted in the first quarter.
The insurance business continues its growth trajectory, were premiums earned in the first
half have increased by 17%. This growth numbers understated due to the cancellation and
re-underwriting of certain legacy parts of that portfolio. In fact, the new business initiatives
along with the existing go forward portfolios have grown almost 30% or 300 million. As a
result of re-underwriting and new growth areas, the book is now demonstrating more
consistent profitability. The improving trend in the attritional is illustrated in the investor
deck. Our new products are now earning in as you will note by comparing earned
premium to written, which should continue to improve our margins. We are well
positioned to produce a good second half.
Thank you. And my colleagues will elaborate further, and of course, welcome your
questions at the end. Craig?

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

Thank you, Dom, and good morning, everyone. Everest had net income of $70 million in
the second quarter of 2018. This compares to net income of $246 million for the second
quarter of 2017. On a year-to-date basis, net income was $280 million compared to $537
million for the first half of 2017. The quarter and year-to-date results were impacted by
current and prior year catastrophe losses. Net income included $9 million of net after-tax
realized capital losses compared to $50 million of capital gains in the first half of 2017. The
2018 capital losses were primarily attributable to fair value adjustments on the public
equity portfolio.
After-tax operating income for the second quarter was $40 million compared to $234
million in 2017. Operating income year-to-date was $260 million compared to $501 million

FINAL

for the first six months of 2017. The overall, underwriting gain for the Group was $20
million for the first half compared to an underwriting gain of $313 million in the same
period last year. The year-to-date combined ratio for the Group was 99.4% compared to
88.3% reported in the first half of 2017, impacted by the higher catastrophe losses in
2018.
In the second quarter of 2018, the company reported a $400 million pre-tax increase in its
estimates for prior year catastrophe events, net of reinsurance and reinstatement
premium. The increase was primarily related to the 2017 storm events which is about onethird of the change related to reopened claims reported in the second quarter, about
one-third coming from higher loss adjustment expenses, and the other one-third coming
from the impact on retro aggregate covers.
The Group also saw $65 million of current year catastrophe losses net of reinsurance. Of
the total, $50 million related to Cyclone Mekunu in Oman, and Yemen, and 15 million
related to the late winter storms in the United States . This compares to $54 million of
catastrophes during the second quarter of 2017.

Bloomberg Transcript

On a year-to-date basis, the results reflected catastrophe losses of $565 million
compared to $74 million during the first half of 2017. Partially offsetting the catastrophe
development was $97 million of favorable prior year reserve development related to noncatastrophe reserves. The prior year favorable development was primarily identified for
reserve studies completed in the second quarter of 2018. These reserves related to the
casualty and property reinsurance business, both in the United States and internationally.
The redundancy determined from the reserve studies was recognized in the second
quarter given the magnitude of the overall indications. These redundancies have
developed over time, but we don't react until the position becomes more mature. We
continue to maintain our loss reserve estimates for the more recent years unchanged.
Excluding the catastrophe losses and favorable prior year reserve development, the
underlying book continues to perform well. The overall attritional combined ratio for the
first six months was 85.3% compared to 85.6% in the first half of 2017. With the
improvements in the attritional combined ratio and the 25% growth in earned premium,
the underwriting profit has improved by more than $100 million on an attritional basis for
the first six months of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017.
Our expense ratio remains low at 5.7% for the first two quarters of 2018, down slightly
from 5.8% for the same period last year. For our investments, pre-tax investment income
was $141 million for the quarter and $280 million year-to-date on our $18 billion investment
portfolio. Investment income was up $23 million or 9% from one year ago. This result
continues to be driven by the increase in limited partnership income, which was up $14
million from the first half of 2017 and the fixed income portfolio. The pre-tax yield on the
overall portfolio was 3.1% compared to 2.9% one year ago as both the investment grade
and alternative fixed income portfolios are up year-over-year . The duration of the
portfolio remains at just over three years.

FINAL

On income taxes, the tax benefit was the result of the amount and geographic region of
the losses associated with the catastrophes and the income associated with the loss
reserve releases in the quarter. The effective tax rate is an annualized calculation that
includes planned catastrophe losses for the remainder of the year. The expected range
for the full year as now 0% to 6%. Lower than expected catastrophe losses would cost
the tax rate to trend towards the higher end of this range.
Positive cash flow continues with operating cash flows of $133 million for the first half of
2018 compared to $634 million in 2017. The decline reflects a higher level of paid
catastrophe losses in 2018 compared to 2017.
Shareholders' equity for the Group was $8.2 billion at the end of the second quarter
compared to $8.4 billion at year-end 2017. The decline in shareholders' equity in the first
half of 2018 is primarily attributable to the $232 million mark-to-market impact on the
investment portfolio and capital return through $106 million of dividends paid, as well as
$25 million of share buybacks, offset by $280 million of net income. The company
returned 47% of net income to shareholders. Our capital position remains very strong.
Thank you. And now John Doucette will provide a review of the reinsurance operations.

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

Thank you, Craig. Good morning. Q2 was the first renewal season following the
catastrophes in 2017 for some loss affected areas. Notably, Puerto Rico and some of the
Caribbean at April 1, as well as Florida at June 1. Overall , the markets were mixed. And
from a rate perspective, they varied based on loss activity, as well as macro and local
supply demand factors. However, these and other renewals in Q2 provided our
underwriters with an opportunity to reshape our portfolio by capturing higher risk adjusted
rewards. We improved our portfolio by achieving rate increases, particularly on loss
affected Puerto Rico and Caribbean accounts growing share with some key Florida clients,
reallocating capacity to different attachment points and better priced layers. We also saw
more turnover in the book as we decrease shares or declined poorly priced deals and
scaled up capacity on more attractively priced opportunities.
Shifting capacity from excess of loss layers and proportional treaties on programs to
where we have paid the best risk adjusted price using our leading reinsurer position in the
market to get preferred signings and utilizing both alternative capital and our equity
capital to most efficiently match risk to capital, all position us for better than market
results. These advantages benefit us even for flat renewals, and helped drive some of
this year's premium growth.
Our reinsurance gross written premium for Q2 was $1.4 billion, and $2.8 billion year-todate , which is a 29% growth in premium over year-to-date 2017, driven by growth in all of
our reinsurance segments. Some of our growth in reinsurance was due to increased
excess of loss and quota share participations on existing treaties and also new quota
share treaties with improved profitability following the 2017 cat losses.

In addition, we achieved some impactful reinsurance successes with several key global
clients who want to trade more broadly with leading global reinsurers such as Everest Re
across multiple lines of business around the world . Over the last several years, we have
deployed significant resources to understand and be responsive to the risk transfer and
risk financing needs of our global clients. Consequently, we continually expand our
strategic relationships with several of these global clients, and thus meaningfully have
increased our in force profitability and future opportunities with them. We also benefited
from rate improvement in certain lines, especially loss affected property lines and select
casualty and professional lines.
We believe our current portfolio overall is stronger and more resilient than it has been for
a long time. As Dom stated, our results did suffer from development on the 2017 events
predominantly from Irma and Maria. The confluence of three significant catastrophe
losses within five weeks caused a surge in demand for loss adjusters inflating loss
adjustment expenses to exceptional level. In addition, claim reopening frequency in both
Florida and Puerto Rico were higher than expected. As noted earlier, the combination of
increasing loss estimates due to reopens and loss adjustment expenses, coupled with the
losses on the California wildfires had a more severe impact to aggregate covers which we
wrote.
Including the 2017 loss emergence, reinsurance produced 107% combined ratio for the
quarter . However, our attritional combined ratio was 79.8% for the quarter and 81.7%
year-to-date, compared to 84.2% and 82.1% respectively in the prior year period. This
quarter's loss ratio benefited almost 2 points from lower non-cat weather losses and a
better expected loss ratio. The improved attritional combined ratios are noteworthy given
the increased share of proportional business and additional casualty writings, which both
typically run to a higher attritional combined ratio than a more property dominated excess
of loss portfolio.
In our US reinsurance segment, gross written premium of $1.3 billion year-to-date grew
23% versus the same period last year. Growth was broad based across property and
casualty lines. We saw new opportunities for excess of loss and pro-rata deal, which
included some new commercial and personal pro-rata business, additional mortgage
writings, reinstatement premiums and increased facultative writings. The Q2 year-to-date
combined ratio was 116.8%. The corresponding loss ratio was elevated by 43 points of cat
losses, mainly from the development on hurricanes Irma and Maria, and the combined
impact that these losses had with other 2017 events on aggregate covers. However the
year-to-date attritional loss ratio decreased 2 points to 54%.
The international segment with gross written premium of $766 million grew by 31% in this
year-to-date period. This included growth in Latin America on new opportunities and
larger post loss treaty participations increased pro-rata writings and additional capacity
deployed on international fact of deal in an improved post loss rate environment, as well
as, growth in new lines of business around the world, such as Indian crop reinsurance out
of our Singapore office and new products out of our Canadian operations. The combined
ratio for the first six months was 88.2%. The six month loss ratio was impacted by 14
points of catastrophe losses, which included about $50 million from Cyclone Mekunu in

Page 6 of 23

Oman with the rest predominantly from Hurricane Maria. The attritional loss ratio is
running about flat year-to-date at 51%.
The Bermuda segment had gross written premium of $785 million or 41% growth during
the first half with contributions from writings covering various territories and lines of
business. This included growth in London, Zurich and Bermuda operations in various lines
in both excess and pro-rata business and included some large opportunities with
multinational insurers and continued expansion of our trade credit, surety and political risk
capabilities and writings. The segment achieved an 83.6% combined ratio in the first half
with the attritional loss ratio up less than a point to 58.6%. The loss ratio was affected by
business mix including additional premium.

Now turning to the 6/1 and 7/1 renewal. Overall the market offered modest rate increases
for both property and casualty. Accordingly, we did not just follow the market but
proactively structured our global property portfolio in a competitive post-loss rate
environment to maximize our return by allocating larger lines are more attractive deals
and reducing or declining underpriced deals. Through this process, we improved our
portfolio for this renewal season representing a better risk adjusted return as we head
into this wind season, with less exposed limit, less PML, more premium and more
expected profit than last year. While some competition on the property side start to
increase market share, we start with accretive deals from our core clients that recognize
the Everest long-term value proposition. In the end, particularly with the increased
deployment of capacity to capped pro-rata treaties, we materially increased our premium
while our cat exposure is flat or down depending on the territory and return period.
With respect to our casualty portfolio, we achieved some rate increases and lower ceding
commissions. Modest improvement in reinsurance terms continued as the casualty
reinsurance market has stabilized considerably from recent years. In addition, we added
new profitable casualty business which was not offered to much of the reinsurance market
whether due to our long-term client and broker relationships, superior ratings, balance
sheet strength or the ability to lead reinsurance programs for clients in all P&C lines
around the world. We are often included in a select group of reinsurers invited to play on
unique market opportunities.
In the mortgage reinsurance market, we remain a leader with a robust in-force mortgage
book and significant future opportunities. With improved loan underwriting practices by
lenders since the financial crisis, loss expectations remain muted in the near term.
However, we remain watchful of potentially destabilizing macroeconomic forces and/or
heightened competition, and we'll manage our portfolio accordingly. We are pleased with
our progress at building a better positioned, meaningfully larger and more diversified
global reinsurance portfolio. We remain confident that we can execute in a market that is
transforming at an accelerated rate, whether it be from third-party capital, M&A
consolidation, evolving distribution channels or rapid technology change and disruption.
With that backdrop of fast-paced change, Everest Re will continue to differentiate itself
with global breadth of capabilities across all P&C lines, meaningful and relevant capacity
supported by alternative capital through Mount Logan, cat bonds, traditional and non-

traditional hedges, evolving and innovative capital structures, all allowing us to maximize
the value proposition to our customers, while enhancing returns to Everest shareholders.

FINAL

Creative product structuring to deliver customized risk transfer and risk financing solutions
for our clients, and expense efficiency and nimble execution via our flat and lean
organization allowing us to capture more dollars of margin for each dollar of premium
than most of our competitors.
Thank you. And now I will turn it over to Jon Zaffino to review our insurance operations.

Thanks, John, and good morning. Our global specialty insurance operations delivered a
solid quarter of performance. We are encouraged by our steady improvement and the
progress we are making toward our key goals. Prominent among these goals are
diversified and profitable growth and increased resilience across our in-force portfolios
and operating platforms. Our team has done an outstanding job executing on the plan
and building upon the many foundational pieces we have put in place over the past three
years.
The second quarter brought some notable performance highlights beginning with the
highest level of quarterly gross written premium, net written premium and net earned
premium realized in our insurance operations history. This further marks the 14th
consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth in our business. This achievement is the
result of highly diversified growth across our property and casualty, and accident and
health operations, our growing geographic reach and our consistently evolving product
capabilities. It also speaks to our increasing relevance within the specialty insurance
market. This quarter's results are also encouraging, considering our two largest
underwriting divisions by gross written premium in the quarter, Everest Underwriting
Partners and our US Property Group experience notable declines in their premium
production due to various deliberate underwriting actions. Importantly, this quarter build
upon the underwriting profitability achieved in the first quarter of this year and brings our
year-to-date underwriting profit to $22 million, more than two-fold increase over prior year
first half.
Our second quarter underwriting profit is $9.5 million, a three times increase over 2017
second quarter and 37 [ph] million more than our 2016 2Q performance. Further, five of
the last six quarters have produced an underwriting profit below the exception being the
third quarter of 2017 where we along with the rest of the industry felt the impact of
unprecedented cat activity. We are encouraged but not surprised to see our profitability
increasing as we expand our specialty product premium writings along with our top line
results.
An area of continued focus for the insurance operation is the attraction of industry-leading
talent across our expanding global platform. Everest insurance remains a highly desirable
home for talented professionals across a range of disciplines. In fact, more than 500
colleagues have chosen to join Everest over the past three years. These talent acquisition

efforts continue to fuel our growth, while ensuring we have the right people in place to
support our expanding books of business. Notable hires this year include a new CEO of
our Canadian Insurance Operation, the Everest Insurance Company of Canada. A new
leader of the Specialty Insurance Group, our dedicated platform in the sports,
entertainment and leisure space, and a new Head of our E&S Casualty operations. Each of
these leaders, strengthened our already deep bench of talent and our representative of
the top five professionals joining our organization. The evolution of Everest Insurance is a
long-term effort and there is room for further improvement, but there is no denying. The
many strategic actions we have taken some 2015 are beginning to take hold and
evidence themselves in our underlying results.

Bloomberg Transcript

Turning to the financial results for the second quarter of 2018, the global insurance
operations produced 646 million in gross written premium, an increase of 77 million or
13% over second quarter 2017. Adjusting for its second quarter 2017 renewal rights deal
that enhance our wholesale property platform gross written premium growth improves to
17%. Year-to-date, gross written premium rose to $1.2 billion, $147 million or 15% increase
over the same period of 2017.
Adjusting for the renewal rights deal first half gross written premium growth also comes in
at 17%. Again, a gross written premium for the second quarter represents the single
largest quarter of production in our history and shows a 96% increase over 2Q 2015,
nearly doubling our production from when we started this transformation Just three short
years ago. The significant addition of new products which continue to gain scale, coupled
with strong performance from our many existing product areas contributed to this
excellent result. Nine of our 11 major business segments showed year-over-year growth in
the first half while our line of business mix remain generally stable with roughly 40% of our
premium written in Short Tail classes and the remainder in our specialty and casualty lines.
Our net written premium growth while still a healthy 6% year-to-date over the comparable
period of 2017, it was impacted by two notable items. First was the previously discussed
2Q '17 renewal rights deal which included a one time transfer of underwritten premium in
that quarter. If we exclude this one-time item, net written premium growth improves to
8% for the first half, further impacting net written premium growth or additional hedges
we have implemented for our wholesale and retail property portfolios which included a
one-time session related to a new quota share placement incepted on April of this year.
Net earned premium in the quarter was 408 million, an increase of 45 million or 12%. Yearto-date, net earned premiums increased by 114 million or 17% over the prior year period to
802 million. The growth in earned premium has been anticipated as various new business
ventures incepted over the past three years begins to earn through the P&L at a greater
rate.
Turning to the combined ratio for the quarter, the GAAP combined ratio was 97.7%, a 140
basis point improvement from the second quarter of 2017. Year-to-date, the GAAP
combined ratio was 97.3%, 150 basis point improvement over the comparable prior year
period. Our attritional combined ratio for the quarter in year-to-date period are 95.4%
and 96.6% respectively. This represents a 1.8% increase over 2017 second quarter of
93.6% and a 90 basis point increase over 2017 year-to-date results of 95.7%.

Last year's second quarter attritional combined ratio had the one-time benefit from an
adjustment to our A&H portfolio which accounts for the majority of the 90 basis points
increase in the year-to-date attritional combined ratio. This quarter's loss and loss
adjustment expense ratio improved 1.6% from the prior year period to 68.7% from 70.3%.
This includes 2.6 points of cat activity in the current quarter related to late winter storms in
the US. This compares favorably to the 3.6 points of cat activity in 2Q '17. The second
quarter '18 attritional loss ratio increased 1.5% to 66.3% from 64.8% in 2Q '17. However, on
a year-to-date basis, the 2018 attritional loss ratio of 66.2% remains very stable and in fact
it's flat compared to the first half '17.
Our expense ratio was stable in the quarter as we take advantage of our improved scale
to continue our investments in people and technology. Our expense ratio in the second
quarter was 29% down from the first quarter results of 31.9%, and essentially flat from 2Q
2017. For the year-to-date period, the expense ratio was 30.5%, up a 100 basis points
from the 29.5% in the comparable period of 2017. Again, we anticipate the expense ratio
to stabilize as we continue on our growth path and as earned premium continues to come
through in the second half of the year. As we've stated in prior calls, an expense ratio of
roughly 30% remains very competitive in the specialty insurance segment.
I want to spend a few minutes on the rate environment and share some observations with
regard to pricing. Overall, I would break this down into three areas. First, we see some
encouraging trends in parts of our US property and commercial auto books, for example.
Second we are encouraged by some gradually improving lines of business such as
primary general liability and various professional lines. And third, there remains some
areas under a higher degree of rate pressure mainly US workers compensation, which we
will continue to closely monitor.
Overall, excluding workers' compensation, Everest Insurance produced an aggregate rate
change of plus 5.8% in the second quarter, which is the strongest rate change we have
seen since the second quarter of 2012, a six year high. Further this continues an upward
trend in non-workers' compensation rate change that began in the beginning of 2017. As
for the encouraging areas, commercial auto was up 14% for the quarter and 13.1% year to
date. Property rates increased 13.1% for the quarter and 12.6% year-to-date. Commercial
auto has been on an upward trend over many quarters. And for property, the second
quarter was the fourth in a row of growing rate increases. As for line showing steady rate
improvement, primary general liability is gaining momentum and the quarter's plus 3.2%
change is more than double the rate increase we experienced in the first quarter of this
year. Further, the second quarter marks the sixth quarter of the last seven in positive rate
change territory of this line. As with respect to various professional lines, they continue to
experience moderate rate pressure, although overall rates appear to be bottoming out,
coming in near flat for the quarter.
Workers compensation despite coming under persistent rate pressure continues to
perform well and in line with our view of loss experience across our portfolio. As stated
previously, we remain encouraged by the profitability of this line of business and we'll
carefully monitor rate and loss cost trends in the coming quarters.

Some concluding comments. Stated simply, the momentum across our global specialty
insurance operation continues, strong premium growth and increasing profitability are
being achieved alongside continued investments in talent, technology and operating
platforms. We have built an adaptive, resilient and relevant specialty insurance
organization that we continue to grow, guided by our number one priority of profitable,
sustainable growth. We look forward to continuing our momentum and reporting back to

Thank you. In your prepared remarks, you spoke about what you got wrong on the cat
losses last year, and suggesting you've under priced loss adjustment expenses. So is the
book of business you have in cat to-date under-priced relative to what you should have
priced to that on January 1.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - John Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

Good morning , Josh. It's John. Thanks for the question. I would not characterize it that
way and we always are continuing to evaluate loss trends and factors that go into our
pricing, and really it was a function of the loss adjustment expenses that happened in
totality when the multiple events happened. But we do look at and have modified our loss
adjustment expenses going forward and we did going into this renewal season at 6/1.

Q - Josh Shanker

{BIO 5292022 <GO>}

Did that changed the competitiveness about how you could participate? Did you find that
your bids are better except at 1/1 than at 6/1.

A - John Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

I think, there's a lot of countervailing occurrence that are happening and at 1/1, that's more
of a different market -- 6/1 is Florida and there's a lot more Territories at 1/1. So I think
there were a lot of moving parts, including some of the capital. I think, there was a more
macro overarching supply demand as we headed into 6/1 but there's a lot of moving parts
that are there.
We did, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks -- we did write more on deals that we
liked and wrote declines several deals or reduced the share of deals that we didn't like
and some of that was pricing, some of that was what we was at the right kind of -- either
an agreement or disagreement, on what the price equilibrium should be for losses that

happened or losses to particular layer. So, either by region or to client or to a layer and
what we thought the price equilibrium should be for that. So it was more than usual churn
in the portfolio this Florida season than we had seen, but we were -- in the end, pleased
with our ability to deploy the capital, supporting the clients that we wanted to support. We
also wrote more proportional business as we indicated both in casualty and in property.

A - Dominic Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Josh, these multiple events also had -- because there were multiple events, had a
disproportionate impact on our retro ag book. And as a result of pricing demands that we
had back in January -- one, we actually have less exposure there, we did in the previous
year.

If you think about your outwards reinsurance book, I think that in retrospect, you wish you
had certain kinds of protection, particularly around LAE that you didn't have coming into
this year. Do you feel well protected on your outwards reinsurance book this year or does
it carry with the same risks that befell you in 2017?

A - John Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

First of all, a big portion of our outwards book is through Mount Logan, which is
proportional, as well as some facultative or specific deals which again are for the most
part proportional. So those are not affected.
Our cat bonds, which frankly make up the bulk of our protections beyond Mount Logan
are really intended to be protected against capital events, not earnings events. So we still
feel very comfortable with our cat load that we profess to be under 9% and (inaudible)
protections are the same or better.

Q - Josh Shanker

Thank you. Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.

FINAL

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Hi, good morning. So my first question just trying to get a bit more color on the increase
to losses for 2017. So, you guys mentioned, part of it was related to the AOB issue in
Florida. We've seen that going on in the State with a bunch of the homeowner insurers for
some times. So in retrospect, I mean -- maybe are you a little bit less surprised that this
happened, just a little bit more color there.
And then my second question would be, I don't know with IBNR that you can disclose in
relation to how you're carrying for these events or some other metric, I guess. So we
would expect -- we can kind of look to a number and say, this has been fully addressed
and we don't expect any additional movement from here?

A - Dominic Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

I will ask Craig to address the IBNR question. But relative to the AOB, the AOB issue was
not the AOB per se, it was the threat of AOB that we think was driving the number of
reopens. So, again, to be clear, what we were seeing is increases were due to reopens,
not as it relates specifically to AOB.

Bloomberg Transcript

Craig, on the IBNR question?

A - Craig Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

On the IBNR, we believe that we put up the adequate IBNIR going through these
calculations for these catastrophe events. Our goal was to put this issue behind us. And
so, we believe that the IBNR that we hold for all our cat events and that's separate from
our non-catastrophe reserves is adequate to cover any and all prior year cat.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Okay. And then my second question, maybe this ties back to a little bit of what Josh was
asking. But if we look at your losses, following on this quarter is increase as a percent of
equity. Really you do stand above your peers following this increase . So in retrospect, as
you think back, where you carrying too much risk to the three storms . And I guess you
know as you've -- you did mention writing less aggregate retro this year. So do you think ,
given that the increase happened kind of right around the mid-year renewals that were
taking place, do you think that you were able to kind of see it in time to make enough
adjustments to the book you're carrying into this year's wind season.

A - Dominic Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

So in response to your first question, take a little bit of -- slightly disagree with
characterizing and it as above our peers. It frankly more in line. We manage our cat
exposure as you know on an after-tax basis. As do many others, but most others are

Page 13 of 23

FINAL

being in Bermuda don't have some of the same advantages from our tax structure that
we do. So frankly, we consider it on that basis.
And again given our capital position, given what I mentioned in my script, it was that -again over the last five years our, overall cat portfolio has been extremely profitable at
generating over $3.5 billion of profits in that five-year time period. As well as, I think, if you
look at our operating ROE compared to our peers, I think you'll find that we lead the
group there as well.
So the answer to your question relative to tax [ph] is, we manage our cat exposure at less
than 9 points of combined ratio points on an annual expected basis. And frankly, over the
last five years or 10 years has actually proven to come in right in around that number. So,
we think we've kind of optimized our portfolio. The fact that we write a lot more retro and
retro ag than most other participants again because of our size and our scale can lead to
a little bit more volatility. But again, we think that that's come with the appropriate returns.
I don't know if that answers your question, but --

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Elyse Greenspan

{BIO 17263315 <GO>}

Yeah, that does. And then one last question, moving away from the cat increase, the
current accident year results were pretty strong in reinsurance in the quarter. In the
prepared remarks, I believe you said 2 points was from non-cat weather and you showed
about a 5 point improvement in your accident year loss ratio in reinsurance in the quarter,
which did standout as you commented just given the shift of pro-rata and casualty
business. Now, is that -- as you think going forward, is that a level of improvement that can
be sustained or were there some other one-timers in the quarter or should we just look
to the half year number as representative of the underlying margin improvement we
could see?

A - Dominic Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

I always prefer to look at the half year number, because any one quarter can have a fair
bit of volatility in it. But I think the half year numbers fairly reflective of what we expect
going forward, recognizing of course that it was positively impacted by the non-cat -- the
scarcity of non-cat, cat events, which has frankly had not occurred for a number of years.
And I recall, last year it was for both primary companies and reinsurers, there was a lot of
storm activity in the first half of the year that didn't reach the level of -- in our case, $10
million per event. So we call them non-cat, cat. But recognizing that difference depending
on how you would like to account for that in your models, the six month numbers would
be more reflective of how we see the portfolio.

A - John Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

And Elyse, good morning. It's John. I would just add a little more color on the portfolio. So
we did see rate increases at different points in time this renewal season post the events.
Again, we talked about it at 1/1, was it as much as we are hoping for now but we did see
rate increases at 1/1, 4/1, 6/1 and 7/1 and that is going to have some impact in the numbers
you're looking at. We also -- as we continue to build out our mortgage and credit
Page 14 of 23



Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td

Date: 2018-07-31

FINAL

portfolio, that has run into an attractive combined ratio. And there's a lot of other things, I
talked about the global clients and the strategic relationship we're building with some of
those also has run favorably.
So there's a lot of moving parts, but again just to reiterate from the prepared comments,
we really believe that our overall portfolio -- our US, international, casualty, professional,
property, mortgage, structured is better positioned today that we've been able to get
rate in some places, but also position the portfolio and build some stronger portfolio
overall. That will impact -- that has impacted the attritional combined ratio.

A - Dominic Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

To further add to that, John mentioned in his prepared comments about -- as well, a low
combined ratio line, expansion in -- or growth in trade, credit, political risk and surety.
Again we have over a number of quarters now (Technical Difficulty) as far as you diversify
our portfolio not only by product and class of business, but also geographically. And I
think, if you look at the underlying metrics, you'll find that we've achieved a lot of that
success and that's in part which driving down what historically had been a much higher
annual expected cat load driving that down below 9% notwithstanding the fact that, yes,
we have these events in '17. But again, given the fact that we have a retro book that -- in
retrospect was not -- it's not a surprising outcome.

Q - Elyse Greenspan

Thank you. Our next question comes from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Good morning, everybody. My first question on the insurance -- reinsurance front. So
Everest, I'd say, it's probably a little bit of an outlier in terms of the strong growth in net
premiums written, that we've seen and that growth has accelerated this quarter. John, I
know you said that this growth was broad. But I'm just curious, are there any particular
notable deals that drove this particularly strong growth this quarter? And are you seeing
the ceding commissions or the ceding rates relatively stable?

A - John Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

Good morning, Yaron. Thanks for the question. So we are -- so a couple of things. So, I
mentioned the global clients. And so the large, the top 15 or so multinational insurers, we
see them coming back -- I would say the pendulum when we've talked about this over the
last several earnings calls or years, where they were retaining more, centralizing their
ceided -- globalizing their treaties and sometimes that work for them on a pro forma
Page 15 of 23

Bloomberg Transcript

FINAL

basis and sometimes it didn't, maybe it didn't work as well on some of the cost of the
business with some of the volatility they wanted. And we do see that there is seems to be
as a pendulum seems to be moving a little bit in the other direction, they are potentially
ceding more. And that is a disproportionate advantage to Everest, because they have
very strong, tight reinsurance security committees. They want to trade with people and
basically all lines of business, not just property, they want trade with reinsurers and all lines
of business and they want to trade with them around the world.
And given our broad portfolio and experienced underwriters that are situated in all the
major markets, hubs around the world, we have that ability to trade with the global
reinsurers locally, as well as holistically at a corporate level, and that is driving not all but
it's driving some of it. We're also seeing continued opportunities in the mortgage space.
And Frankly we are seeing other clients coming to the market with casualty and
professional reinsurance treaties in a way that we haven't seen in the last couple of years.
So we had been bearish on the casualty space for many years and ahead of our peers on
decreasing as the ceding commissions went up and we didn't like the trade as much or
the strategic positioning of that, and we're directionally moving -- Increasing our capacity
to that space as we do see more favorable dynamics for us to allow us to support
casualty and professional treaties. And again, we do have some strategic relationships
there, not just with the global clients that are resulting in some meaningful premium
opportunities.
And you asked about the ceding commissions. We are seeing in some cases the ceding
commissions coming down. There has been a lot of talk about that, that maybe a
property can't subsidize other lines of business, that other lines of business will have to
stand more on their own. So at 1/1, we were pleased with that and we continue to see
some favorable movement on ceding commissions across our long tail book of business.

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

That's helpful. And just to clarify, the increased use of your services in your balance sheet
by the global clients that's coming -- that's broad-based or is it coming from a
concentrated number of clients?

A - John Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

So, we trade with all of them. The top 14, 15, 16 of them, but it varies. With some of them
we trade a lot more and part of that's there. Session strategy, the reinsurance strategy on
how -- where they are in that thought process. Part of it is long-term relationships that
we've developed with them, part of it is where they're situated. So there's a lot of moving
parts, but we do trade with all of them. But what we are seeing is our ability that, when
they come to the market, they would come and talk to Everest. They'll come and talk to a
few other large global reinsurers but they won't necessarily talk to a broad reinsurance
panel. And again that is disproportionally impacting favorably our ability to grow the book
and diversify the book.

A - Dominic Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Page 16 of 23



Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td

Our growth with these global clients for most of those relationships, we believe, the total
volume is growing. Not all, but -- so we can, if you're trying to get to as there a small
handful, it's across the spectrum.

FINAL

Q - Yaron Kinar

{BIO 17146197 <GO>}

Okay, that's helpful. And then on the insurance side. I guess given that net premiums
earned are up over 15% in the first half of the year, why would the expense ratio
deteriorate year-over-year?

A - Jonathan Zaffino

{BIO 16652236 <GO>}

Good morning. This is Jon. I think you're going to see some movement in any discrete
quarter based on the timing of our hiring efforts and timing of various investments in
technology, I think what we're aiming for is, again as I said in my prepared remarks, that
30% level is quite competitive. But there's a lot of moving parts as we continue to expand
geographically in various lines of business and make various investments. So that's part of
it. We look at the -- on a trailing 12 month basis, it's trending in the right way and we also
look at it compared to first quarter which obviously was a nice improvement. So we're
pretty comfortable about where that's been.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Kumar with the Buckingham Research
Group.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Thanks, and good morning. And thanks for the color. I have three follow-up questions to
the loss development discussion. Number one, just going back, I guess in your opening
remarks, you outlined two reasons for the loss development. Two other companies in our
universe talked about the same reasons, yet they actually release reserves from 2017
events. How can we as outsiders reconcile these two things in which Everest in an outlier?

A - Dominic Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Well. I can't speak to what their process is and I think I've already suggested that we have
to make some changes in the way we look at these things. And I'll point back to -- and I
can't speak to what the circumstances were in these two companies. Some of which by
the way -- we may have supported on the retro side and didn't see losses from them until
the second quarter. So that's kind of an interesting sidebar. But we were

Page 17 of 23



Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td

Date: 2018-07-31

FINAL

disproportionately impacted by retro ag book which by definition is going to be a late
report.
And I think overall, I can't speak to what they've done versus what we've done, but we
know we have to make changes to how we address these multiple events going forward.
I will also point to the fact that, you might recall that in the weeks following, in the months
following these events that widespread press reports of claims being closed, the events
were not as large as -- was expected. So there was some market chatter, if you will, that
wasn't selling off any alarm bells for us, and clearly in retrospect that was a mistake, but -and we had literally admit that.
But for sure, the loss itself is certainly contained within our capabilities, within our earnings.
Our long-term track record is still intact and when you go back and push this event back
into '17, I still submit to you that our operating returns were better than one of our peers.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Fair point. I guess, just relating to that answer, can we have some comfort or how much
limit is left in this cover which you were referring to? And how will this respond if there is
any additional development?

A - Dominic Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I will ask Craig or John to --

A - John Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

So, I mean as we went through this from a ground up, we did look at the aggregate
covers that had losses submitted on them. And we know what those limits are and that
remain on those covers. But what we really did from a modeling standpoint and going to
the underlying -- underwriters was trying to find out what other aggregate covers have we
written where we haven't seen a loss selection yet, and we are trying to extrapolate that
across our portfolio.
So that was included in our additional loss estimate for these events.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

Got it. The third and final question, it's been a few years since we've discussed models
and their efficacy. I know, in the past, I think you've mentioned using an AIR model. Any
thoughts on AIR versus RMS and even any thoughts of changing the models that we use?
Thank you.

A - John Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

So look, we are all aware of limitations of the models and that these are tools, and one of
the things that go into how we underwrite, how we price and how we reserve. And there
were many examples during -- not just the 2017 events, but events prior to that, that

Page 18 of 23

Date: 2018-07-31

FINAL

showed model misses from the major vendors and that happened multiple times
including -- during the 2017 events with quarters of magnitude missed.
So we agree with you that the models are a tool and it need to be thought that way, and
so we rely -- we look at the models, but we rely on, first principles as well as underwriting
who the clients are we want to support, what do we think of their underwriting? What do
we think of our positioning with them. How they trade forward, how they treat reinsurance
and/or retro writers? And we think that allows us to both build a profitable book of
business as well as build a sustainable competitive franchise with clients that we have
around the world.

Q - Amit Kumar

{BIO 15025799 <GO>}

(Multiple Speakers) the AIR model, right?

A - Jonathan Zaffino

Yeah.

A - Dominic Addesso

We use AIR, we also look at RMS, we look at other -- a lot of AIR and RMS haven't
developed in some of the more developed -- developing countries and we look at local
models -- we try to look at all data sources, all modeling, all vendor models that we can to
determine what we think is Everest's fewer risk.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Good morning. Thank you for fitting me in. My first question is on the current quarter's,
second quarter catastrophe losses, $65 million seems higher than your preannouncement two weeks ago, just want to clarify that.

A - Craig Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

So Kai, this is Craig. We pre-announced a net after-tax number and that number was net
of other current year weather related losses. So, as you heard us talk about, we were able
to lower our loss selection on the reinsurance side for non-cat losses if you will. Anything
Page 19 of 23



Company N ame: Everest Re Group L td
Company Ticker: RE US Equity
Date: 2018-07-31

below $10 million, we were able to lower that loss selection, because we didn't have
many events during the first half of the year that were indicating reinsurance exposure.

FINAL

So that's that was offsetting that 65 and the rest is after-tax to get us to 25 million, and
that was in the pre-release.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay. So that portion benefits your underlying core loss ratio in your reinsurance
operations.

A - Craig Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

That's correct. It was not a cat event, it was the underlying reinsurance attritional loss ratio.

Q - Kai Pan

{BIO 18669701 <GO>}

Okay, great. My second question on the insurance side. It looks like, if you would take out
adjustments year ago, it's pretty flat in terms of combined ratio -- underlying combined
ration. Given the business growing and still probably not upto the goal for mid-90s
combined ratio yet. So, do you think, if there is room for further improvements towards
that goal? And how quickly you can get there?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Jonathan Zaffino

{BIO 16652236 <GO>}

Hi, Kai. It's Jon. Good morning. Yes, let me remember this, there is few things going on in
the second quarter comparative. First as I mentioned was the renewal rate still which
moves some things around. Secondly was the one-time adjustment for our A&H book. So,
achieving the flat both loss and combined on the attritional basis -- that feels like we are
directionally moving in the right way, considering come of the deliberate underwriting
actions we took throughout the first half of the year and actually, candidly we have for the
prior couple of years. We expect that momentum to continue. For instance, some of our
newer businesses which we think had very favorable risk return characteristics were about
one-third of our premium writings in the quarter as an all time high from the inception of
each of these.
So, as that continues to earn through, we do expect further improvement. Again, you
might get some movement at any discrete quarter based on various movements across
the book. But overall, we still think there is room for improvement.

A - Dominic Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

To add to that Kai, we have some of our newer lines of business of longer earning
periods, whether it is surety, trade credit, political risk, transaction risks and those
portfolios are beginning to build and the earned premium is going proportionately there
and those are very low combined ratio classes.

Thank you. We will take our last question from Meyer Shields with KBW.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks. Two quick ones, I think. First of all, in reinsurance, was there any change in the
accident year loss pick for casualty and specialty lines from the first quarter to the second
quarter?

A - Dominic Addesso

{BIO 1428096 <GO>}

There was -- there's always movement, Meyer, with respect to loss picks throughout the
quarter. We constantly look at -- we hope reserve committees at the end of each quarter
-- as part of process, we do that both on the reinsurance side and the insurance side. But
as we go through that process, we look at everything. We look at rate change, upward
down. We look at loss cost trend, upward down. But there is constant movement in those
expected loss ratios in any given quarter. Were there movements this quarter? The
answer is, yes, slight movements always.

A - John Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

But nothing material and some of that has to reflect the fact that, we've had some newer
business coming into that line. So it has to be reflective of the business that we are now
putting on the books. But generally, it's been pretty stable.

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

Okay, that's very helpful. So in the past few years, you've had phenomenal aggregate
reserve development and generally concentrated in the fourth quarter. I know this is sort
of unrealistic question, in which should we assume that some of the second quarter
reserve releases came out of what we would normally see in the fourth quarter as a
function of conservative reserving?

FINAL

Well, part of the answer to that question -- it's not a ridiculous question. The reserve
studies that we have done this time are the same reserve studies that we do every time - this time of the year. Typically those reserve studies, because they're smaller lines of
businesses don't produce these kinds of results, which -- and therefore, they are not
material. And therefore , sometimes if the material that get booked is the non-material
then we wait for the fourth quarter.
So this time around, we have some relatively smaller lines of business or class of a
business that produce pretty favorable number obviously. And so it's obviously -- I don't
know the answer to your question because we haven't done the year-end reserve studies
yet. But typically, we wouldn't expect this level of releases from the lines of businesses
that we're under review. And therefore, you wouldn't expect these lines of business to
have contributed that much to the year-end reserve releases. Is that helpful at all?

Q - Meyer Shields

{BIO 4281064 <GO>}

It is, yes, very much so. And I guess just final follow-up, is there any sense of the change in
or any quantification of losses here to Mount Logan because of the reserve shift?

A - Craig Howie

{BIO 17579923 <GO>}

Could you say that again? What exactly --

Yeah, I'm sorry. The magnitude of the change in 2017 catastrophe losses that were ceded
to Mount Logan.

A - John Doucette

{BIO 7178336 <GO>}

Yeah. So, this is John. So the short answer is yes. As indicated previously, Mount Logan
participates on -- basically quota shares of layers and portfolio of business that Everest
rides. And consequently the session to Mount Logan grew particularly -- grew accordingly
with the increase in the loss picks that Everest put forth.

FINAL

Thank you, Todd and thanks to all for your questions today. I hope you came away with a
better understanding of the circumstances regarding our reserve change. But
nevertheless, as we look back at the portfolio and our business model, we remain very
confident that our underwriting strategy is solid. As I mentioned, it's evidenced by our five
year average operating ROE through 2017 which after adjustment for the cat losses was
11.8%. This is better than each of the companies in our peer group. I think, it's worth
emphasizing.
Cat business is volatile. But as I pointed out, it's profitable through the cycle. And again as
I mentioned previously, it is less than 9 combined ratio points an average through those
same five years. But what I really -- I think the message we want to leave you with is the
understanding of the breadth of our entire business model. And over the last couple of
years, we've succeeded in lessening our cat exposure by diversifying our reinsurance
portfolio into credit, other specialty classes. Along with this, as John talked about the
resurgence in our casualty lines of business.
As a consequence, the attritional results continue to improve. Furthermore, the organic
build of our insurance operation has been noteworthy. We now have profitable, specialty
insurance operation expected to exceed over $2 billion in premium, that's double from
three years ago. I recognize in the short term that it maybe very natural to look at those in
this business that can be sometimes misleading. And if you more closely examine the
underlying metrics, I think you'll find and get a better sense of what the future holds for
Everest. So we believe it's a bright one.
