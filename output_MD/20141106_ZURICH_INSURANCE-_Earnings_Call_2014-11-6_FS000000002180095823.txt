MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, good morning or good afternoon. Welcome to the results for the
nine-months September 30, 2014 Conference Call. I'm Stephanie, the Chorus Call
operator. I would like to remind you that all participants will be in-listen only mode and
the conference is being recorded. After the presentation, there will be a Q&A session.
The conference must not be recorded for publication or broadcast. At this time, it's my
pleasure to hand over to Mr. James Quin. Please go ahead, sir.

James Quin

{BIO 18345789 <GO>}

Thank you and welcome to Zurich's results presentation for the third quarter of 2014. I'm
joined by our CFO, George Quinn, who will make a few short comments before we open
the Q&A. As usual, please keep to two questions.
I'll now hand it over to George.

FINAL

Thank you, James. Good afternoon or good morning, everyone. As James said, I'll make a
few and short introductory remarks. So ﬁrst, in General Insurance, we've reported a
combined ratio of 97.7% for Q3. And within that, we have good progress on our accident
year ex-cat combined ratio which is 1.4% better than in the prior year and that's due to
continued improvement in our underlying loss ratio.
Cat losses are well within expectations for Q3, but perhaps a bit higher than you may have
expected, given a generally quiet quarter. And this is mainly because of Hurricane Odile
which cost us $90 million. On PYD, we have a positive contribution to the combined ratio
of 0.6% for the quarter and the nine months. And that's again a bit less than the expected
range of 1% to 2% that I indicated at the time of our Q1 results.
About the (01:35) Q2, this is due to some speciﬁc identiﬁable issues with some volatility to
be expected. But it doesn't change what we expect from this in the future.
The Life results are in line with expectation and we continue to progress on our strategy to
reposition the business. And some of the costs associated with these initiatives are
included in the results.

Bloomberg Transcript

And in Farmers, we have some good news. We're back on a growth track in terms of gross
premiums. We are pretty much ﬂat in terms of policies in force.
Overall, we characterize this as a solid set of results. But as you would have seen from the
presentation this morning, we may start to see some headwinds in the next year or so,
given the market environment that we face.
This doesn't require any change in strategy on our part, but it does mean that we'll need
to push harder on some of the levers that we have around optimizing the capital
allocation, around expenses, amongst other factors, to make sure that we hit our targets.
And with that, I now look forward to answering your questions.

Q&A

First question from Vinit Malhotra, Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Hi. Good afternoon. Just – so my two questions, ﬁrst is, George, in the comments in the
presentation in the morning, there is a mention that part of the 150 basis points
underlying loss ratio improvement comes from NAC and Europe. Could you please
comment a bit more if NAC driven by the analytics and if Europe, more the result of this

retail focus and equivalent? (03:20) And also, I'm curious why not Global Corporate,
given that pricing that it's all been a little better at least in NAC. So do you have any
comments on that?
And just secondly just on the – you also said that you did not assume tailwinds, but
probably you had assumed a neutral position when they invested their targets or set both
on markets, on pricing markets, intersets (03:52) et cetera? So how much is the concern
around the headwinds that we see? Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thank you, Vinit. Good afternoon. So on the improvement that we see across GI, I mean,
you're absolutely right, we did attribute in the commentary, improvement to NAC and in
Europe. I mean we see signiﬁcant improvement in Global Corporate, I mean, it's at least
about 3 points, but the challenge on Global Corporate is that the – I mean, the sector
(04:23) is just generally more volatile because of the impact of large losses. So it's a bit
harder in a given quarter to isolate the speciﬁc improvement in Global Corporate, but we
do believe that that also contributes to the underlying 150-basis-point improvement.

Bloomberg Transcript

In terms of driver for NAC and for Europe, I mean, NAC – I mean it's been – we're
investing a lot on the predictive analytics side of it, but I think it's, I mean, it's a little bit
rash to claim at this stage. It's already a major driver of the improvement. I mean, NAC has
a market-leading position in the U.S. in a number of particular industry sectors. I think
they're using the competitive strengths that's beneﬁting also from market improvement in
those areas. It's combination of both.
In Europe, I think it's mainly general rate improvement has been driving the improvement
we're seeing there.
On the rate environment, I mean you've seen the comments I've made today on the
market outlook, which, I mean, just to be clear, it impacts everyone. I wasn't trying to be
speciﬁc about Zurich and so on. And hopefully, I'm not seeing much, it's very diﬀerent
from Q2 but come back to planning, when we put the targets together for the discussions
in December last year. I mean, we haven't seen tailwinds, but absolutely (05:47) – we
didn't see any signiﬁcant headwinds either. And I think we will see some rate pressure
over the course of the next 24 months. And I guess the commentary this morning was
designed to acknowledge (05:59) that the company sees, well, I think almost everyone
else sees.
So, I mean, hopefully, it's not really new. It's really a signal that we're awake and aware.
And also more importantly, to signal that, I mean, we completely understand it, that
means we can't stand still. And therefore, more eﬀort is required to make sure that we get
to where we have to be.
And as I pointed out in the press release this morning, I mean, I think we're fortunate in
the position that we have a number of diﬀerent levers at our ﬁngertips which range from
the continued application of the very solid (06:39) underwriting practices that we have

FINAL

already that have been part of the driver of that 150-basis-point improvement. And we
have an expense opportunity, I think we can be far more eﬃcient than we are.
Fairly, I mean, we're blessed with – because of high quality problem on the capital side,
we have a signiﬁcant excess against our key target metrics, and I mean, that positions us
well both for the organic opportunities and the inorganic. I mean, you're absolutely right,
no headwinds, no tailwinds assumes; we'll work harder and get to where we need to be
anyway.

Next question from Michael Huttner, JPMorgan. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 21417183 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Just a couple of things. On the reserve or prior-year (07:29) development, can you say
how much was the UK and whether it's a kind of three-year or two-year recurring pattern?
and what – how we should understand the 1% to 2% going forward as being sustainable
given that there are – some of your competitors are seeing the opposite?
And then on the tax side, I was interested to see that, yes, you're guiding to slightly
higher, and I wonder if you could give me more insight into that. Is this is a mix eﬀect
because you have more proﬁts out of the U.S., which is a high-tax country, or is it
generally a rise in taxation from all countries? Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thanks, Michael. Sorry. We're muting the phone in between.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 21417183 <GO>}

I beg your pardon. Sorry.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

I'm going to press the hang up button which should be no good (08:56)

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 21417183 <GO>}

Don't worry. That's all good.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Good afternoon. So ﬁrst of all, on the reserve releases, UK APH, there's a charge in the
quarter of $70 million. I mean, it's not an overall book. I mean, APH in total is about $2.7
billion of reserves. I mean, it's paper things (08:48) that you don't do every year. Yes,
Page 4 of 18



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG
Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2014-11-06

(08:49) we did do it on a periodic frequency. I don't know if it's two years or three years. I
mean, it's typically three years. And so, I mean, it does come around from time to time.

FINAL

And I think as – I mean, as you're well aware, I mean it's pretty rare that someone has an
APH review and then it answers a reserve release. So, it's a risk factor, for sure. From an
overall perspective, I mean, – and I said this at Q2, so I'm obviously aware of repeating it
again.
But I mean, again, if I look through it, I can easily see that we're within the expected range.
So, I mean, I have no reason to expect anything diﬀerent from 1% to 2% in a longer-term
perspective, and we're not changing the game. But things like UK APH will come along
from time to time. But I mean I hope that's not everything is like APH. We will have reserve
reviews occasionally that do actually (09:43) But we expect 1% to 2%.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the tax rate, so – I mean, (09:52) but the tax rate comment today, I mean, isn't really
the result of the rate you see for the quarter. It's not really connected to that. I mean, the
rate we've seen, we have 33% for the quarter. We anticipate 29.4% for the full year. I mean
that's a mixture of impacts which range from, I mean, things you've heard of before like
Russia, changes in tax rates in Chile, the impact of things like Hurricane Odile and they
have to have a (10:23) low tax jurisdictions for us.
But I mean, structurally, I don't foresee the change. But we're looking through planning,
so we're obviously forecasting or estimating what we expect to be projecting for the next
two years to three years. And given the mix that we see, I certainly see a tendency for the
rate to rise. And again, just a note of caution around the fact that even if tax rates, I mean,
more generally falling than rising, I guess the tax base in most jurisdictions has been
broadened.
So, I mean, that is why I've increased the guidance today. I guess the most important point
to make though is this does not change our expectation of achievement of the target. So,
I mean, (11:13) part of it is mix, part of it is Latin American. And generally, they have higher
tax rates, but I need more proﬁts before I pay more tax.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 21417183 <GO>}

I see. So I should understand the tax comment as not as negative, but eﬀectively you're
saying the U.S. is going to deliver a lot more earnings.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Not quite the U.S.

Q - Michael I. Huttner

Yeah. So, I mean, if you look at the places with a higher tax, I mean, Latin America is the
place that stands out. So, mix means slightly more of expectation of proﬁt from Latin
America.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hello. Hi there. Two quick questions, George, sorry to go back to your transcript this
morning, the problem of getting the transcript out, we can look at every word. The
implication is that there's slightly more headwinds than maybe you felt from the operating
environment.
But is there – at least from what you've said, particularly the expression you used is
meaningfully improved eﬃciency. It seems that – have you discovered a new opportunity
in terms of, be it cost saves, re-underwriting? You said there's more headwinds in the
environment, but from a bottom-up perspective, is the growth more conﬁdent as you
found new opportunities to improve things bottom-up? That's what I'm reading from that,
but maybe that's reading too much, just clarify that.
Secondly, Farmers, I mean, is the beginning of a growth phase it too early to call that? Is
there any more conﬁdence? You had quite a lot of conﬁdence at Q2 and we've seen that
come through. What is the sort of new business indications or customer feedback
indications running at now in terms of future momentum? Thanks.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thanks, Andrew. So on the ﬁrst one, on the eﬃciency point. I mean, I'm expecting at some
point at the course of the call, someone's going to ask me about, say, 1% expense ratio in
GI. I mean, that's a logical well-thought through reason behind the expense level and it's
not that it just happened to be that number. So we are deliberately investing to try and
create the best platforms to make us more competitive in a number of markets. But, I
mean, that's not a sustainable level for the expense ratio.
I mean, we're certainly setting a hard target for a year. I know that when Mike Kerner looks
at it, I mean, he looks at the peer group. I mean, he certainly has the ambition to be at
least as good if not better than the peer group. And you know what type of number peer
group expense ratio start with. (14:05) So, I mean, we're not – I don't see a restructuring or
some brand eﬃciency plan today. But I think there are a number of areas where we have
Page 6 of 18

FINAL

an opportunity to be more eﬃcient and it's more important that we take them, given
some of the commentary that you have from me, I mean, not only me but from other
markets observers on rates.
So I think I wouldn't characterize it as a group who's just discovered them because we've
had a number of things pointed out just over some time. But I mean, we're going to do
the logical and obvious things to make sure that we can maintain the commitments that
we've made, and expenses will play its part in that process.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

And just a quick (14:44) one, when you talk about commitments, you're talking both the
ROE and the bulk growth commitments, is that – or do you put more emphasis on one
than the other?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So we have two sets of targets, one ﬁnancial and one strategic. And they're all equally
important.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

On the Farmers growth side, so I mean with the beneﬁt of hindsight, it seems obvious, I
mean if you look at the chart, it would be hard to believe that you couldn't have reached
this point, I mean, given what we see around retention, new business and agents, et
cetera. I mean, we remain optimistic, I mean, I want to avoid – I know that you say
something that target for Farmers today, obviously, we're looking for them to sustain what
we've achieved, but we'll have Jeﬀ Dailey at the investor update in December, and he'll
go into this in more detail there.
But obviously, we're very pleased with the fact that back in growth, I mean, ﬁnancially, it's
not immediately signiﬁcant impact there is, but I hope that from a sentiment perspective,
it gives people more conﬁdence that, I mean, we actually have a very eﬀective model here
on the exchanges.

Hi. Good afternoon. Two questions, please, one on capital and one just to expenses, to be
original. On the expenses, you have – the outlook across your business. It's hard to see
any major (16:28) momentum that won't be driven by self-help frankly, so your momentum
has to be driven by actions that you take.
Should we expect in the Investor Day that we get a little bit more speciﬁc guidance on
those actions being taken, because that still feels to me a little bit – that we've got
turnaround businesses but not totally clear beyond transaction, what you'll do there? Is
there any intention to set targets, you seem to be downplaying a little the degree to which
you can do this. It feels a little bit like you're talking about bits and pieces that you can do
rather than the great, grand plan. So just some guidance or thoughts around when we're
making some guidance from there
And on capital, you stress it frequently in the commentary this morning and you said it
again today about the ﬂexibility. I wouldn't expect you to be making any great
announcements to my question. But is that, for you, a key lever in starting to ease some of
your – some of the areas where there is a little bit pressure on the business? And if you
can give us any color on that, that'd be useful.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I mean it's amazing how two questions can seem to be a lot more than two questions. So
ﬁrst of all in the expenses, I completely agree with you. I mean I think this is – it needs to
be self-help. But I think the good news is it's not purely self-help around expenses and
that's why the comment on levers, many more than one.
So, I expect it – I mean I don't have much to add to what I said to Andrew a second ago. I
mean, I don't expect to take part of the team and to send or to cover expenses. I mean,
we'll have two of the business leaders there. I mean, the expenses may come up in the
context with the presentations they make. But I don't anticipate that we'll have a session
dedicated to expense management in the December update.
And as far as targets go, I mean – and I know it's clear if I set targets, but I mean I think the
group actually has enough targets already and I think our focus needs to be on achieving
them. And within achieving them, expenses plays its part. I mean it will get clearer as we
go. I mean, I'd like to deliver some improvements rather necessarily set out new numbers.
But I mean it's clearly an area where we have the potential to improve.
Maybe just to add a couple of other points and the other things so it's not just purely an
expense discussion. I mean, even though I'm not that conﬁdent on margin expansion
being oﬀered by the market environment, I don't believe that the growth completely
(19:23) to a whole either. I mean I think that we have an opportunity, for example, in
Global Corporate, there are a number of things that we can do to increase the number of
products that we sell to the clients. I mean, there's a number of things across the entire
client universe, I think, that will still lead to growth. And that would expand the absolute
economics even if rates don't help us.

FINAL

On the capital side, I mean, I don't really have much to add to what I said at Q2 around
priorities. I mean, I think you're aware, I mean, only dividends and growth, organic and
inorganic, and then if we have excess, the possibility of capital reclassiﬁcation.
I think, generally, though, I mean, I'm ﬁrmly at the belief that, I mean, dynamic capital
management is a key part of the management than the insurance company. So I mean
there are still things that we need to do to improve the allocation of capital over the
course of the next some 24 months. So I do see that as part of the answer to some of the
questions. It's not just an R issue; it's also an E issue.

Q - Andy D. Broadﬁeld

{BIO 7273415 <GO>}

And S&P still the main constraint on the capital side of the P because there were good
news on that earlier in the month, wasn't it, or last month?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yeah, it was. So I mean, as you cited, we've been moved to positive outlook and the S&P
is still the main constraint.

Next question from Farooq Hanif, Citigroup. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi there. Thanks very much. I wanted to just change direction a little bit. So in the Life
business, you've also taken some costs in the other line to do partly with in-force
management. And I'm just wondering, obviously, how long is this going to continue,
what's the scope of it, and what are you trying to achieve with this particular thing that
you're doing right now? So is that sort of expense reduction, capital release? If you give
some more information, that'd be quite useful.
And then, on large losses and just the point you make about it in terms of normalizing, if
we went back to the old language of the large loss ratio, where would we be right now?
Thanks.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So on the second one, you had me at a distinct disadvantage because I'm not that familiar
what the old language, to be honest. Maybe the IR team could help you afterwards,
Farooq, if that's okay.

Yeah. Sorry about that. So on the other course, on the Life side, so the – unfortunately, I'm
not going to give you much more satisfying answer to this question either. So, it's
relatively hard to talk about all the things that we're doing because if I do, it wouldn't
necessarily help us because (22:11) to the market ahead of time.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Yeah, okay. So, on the Life side, so is this going to be potentially, I mean, something that
we should bear in mind and hope it'll (22:26) happen again and recurring? So, when we
think about little one-oﬀs versus recurring items?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So, I think, I mean, what you see this quarter – well, I wouldn't immediately call it as oneoﬀ. I wouldn't expect it to go at the same level in all of the following quarters. I mean, also,
we're preparing for – I mean, what you heard from Kristof during Q2 in the targets – not
the targets but the planned improvement that he has on board. And so we'd take some of
this, I guess the proprietary steps necessary to work on the operational improvement that
he's talked about and also work on the capital sort of things for Life.
So, I mean, you'll see more of that in due course, and you'll deﬁnitely see more of that in
May next year, where Life will be one of the key focal topics.

Q - Atanasio Pantarrotas

{BIO 5933123 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you for taking my question. Good afternoon. I have two questions. One is
regarding your statement about the softening market in GI. I wonder if we have to
consider the current level of accident year loss ratio at around 64% as the bottom. So we
can expect to see some deterioration ahead and what could be the strategy of Zurich in
the case of a softening market? I mean, we have expected to see reduction in volumes to
defend the proﬁtability as we saw in 2009 and 2010?
Second question is on realized gain, I saw that you realized, this year particularly, high
level of gains both in below operating line and also in the Life business. And I wonder if
you, without this realized gain in the Life business, your net investment income is still
pretty much good or you need that to realize some gains in order to give credit enough
to your policyholder? Thank you.

So at least a softening market in GI, ﬁrst. So, and obviously these comment today, I really
like to (24:44) highlight that particular risk that you referred to. And if we do see a
softening market, what do we do? And I think many of the things I referred to earlier in the
call. So a focus on continued discipline in underwriting. I think you've seen the company's
track record here. We are not driven by volumes. We are absolutely focused on proﬁt.
Obviously, we have the same positions that we've created over time, but I mean we have
a focus on margin before anything else. I mentioned earlier the potential for eﬃciency
and then, of course, we also have the capital ﬂexibility that I highlighted earlier. So I think
all three of these things would play into our routine (25:30) to make sure that any
softening that we see in the market doesn't endanger the overall targets that we have.
On the Life side, you're right, there's a particularly high level of gains. If we focus ﬁrst on
the bulk component, I mean, that's really a policyholder piece of the equation and it's not
been driven by our shareholder need or expectation. So, I mean, I don't see it as a
particular issue for sustainability of the Life performance.
Both sides of BOP and in NIAS, I mean, you've seen – probably a reasonable level of gains
but I guess I'd highlight particularly in Q3 that, I mean, that's somewhat automatic. It's
more an outcome of the accounting than a decision that the company has made because
it's mainly the revaluation of property. So, unfortunately, we don't entirely control that. But
those are the drivers of the gains that you've seen.

Next question from Paul De'Ath, Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Paul C. De'Ath
Hi there. And just a couple of quick questions, hopefully. Firstly, on Farmers, just looking
at the margin, the 7% margin on there, you mentioned in the speaker notes that this is
kind of in line with long-term guidance. I guess in the more short term, is this kind of the
level that we should be expecting that margin to be at?
That's question one. And then question two was just very quick thing on the non-core
result, which obviously was one of the kind of swing factors in the numbers for this
quarter. Just if you could sort of elaborate slightly on that and where that number might
be going in the next few quarters, that would help a lot. Thanks.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks, Paul. So ﬁrst of all, in Farmers, I mean, yes, I would guide you to expect the
margin to be around that level. I mean, I think we've seen it around here in the past. Our
guidance was at 7%. It was sustainable and that's where we've ended up this quarter. So, I
mean, I would suggest that you use that as the forward-looking. (27:47)

On the non-core side of things, I mean, non-core is slightly diﬀerent. As you point out,
we've gone from, I think, it was kind of $24 million or $25 million proﬁt in the same quarter
last year to almost the same number the opposite same this quarter.
I mean we still have a number of portfolios in there. I mean the priority is to get rid of
them and ideally release the capital as quickly as we can. So you will still see a bit of
volatility in non-core, I mean, the decisions there will be driven by what we perceive to be
shareholder value.
But that doesn't mean it's relatively diﬃcult to predict the absolute impact in a given
quarter. I mean, having said that though, the maybe amounts that we have left are not
huge. It's unlikely, I think, that you'd see large – very large swings in proﬁts or losses on a
given quarter that I mean you might see a bit disturbance from time-to-time. So my
apologies that I can't really give you a clear steel (28:54) on the likely level for non-core
business.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you, good afternoon. Two questions. One on the General Insurance side, we
note that the main area growing right now is international market, 9% in local currency,
however, this is the weakest margin market. And I wonder whether we should expect,
hence, a deteriorating business mix and if this is sort of the right direction Zurich wants to
go.
And secondly on Farmers at 0.6% growth according to what we know, this means Zurich –
Farmers is still losing substantial market share in the U.S. And I remember from the
Investor Day last year that one of the actions management wanted to take was costcutting as Farmers to be more competitive. And I wonder if you could give us an update
where Farmers is on this cost-cutting journey?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thanks, Thomas. On the ﬁrst one, I mean for obvious reasons, it's not (30:04) to achieve a
deteriorating business mix. I mean, we're looking to allocate capital to areas that generate
rate returns. If we see growth whether it's in Global Corporate, NAC, international
markets, Europe or anywhere else, that we believe oﬀers attractive returns then we have
the capital to support it. But obviously, we're not looking to chase this turn (30:26) by
allocating capital to business that doesn't return the required level of return.

I think – so, it's fair to say that IM or international market is the lowest RE segment and also
looking just to the plain number like combined ratio net of nat cat is 102% which is
markedly above the rest of the group?

FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Yeah. I mean it's coming back to gross. I mean it's 9% from a low base but 2% adjusted in
Global Corporate and you can guess which one has the far more signiﬁcant contribution
in proﬁtability.
On the second question on Farmers, I mean I think if you still put the point sets, I think
you're right. But I mean I think we would go further than simply to look at the point sets.
(31:15) If we look at the core of what Farmers reached – have attained (31:18) over time. So,
therefore, we excludes the 21st Century brand which, of course, is not supported any
more. And we also exclude the business insurance ran through independent agents. We
see a number more like 2.6%. I mean we'd always be happy with a number that's higher,
but given where Farmers is coming from, I think we're very happy with the progress that
we've made. I mean we hope to see more. We hope to see it sustain what they've done.
But, I mean, for me, this is a relatively important watershed for Farmers.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the cost control side of things, I think things are broadly ﬂat. And Jeﬀ and the team
has certainly been looking at trying to optimize things in Farmers management services,
but I don't have a particular update for you. And of course, we'll Jeﬀ, again, with the
investor update in December, and we'll see if we can give you a bit more insight there.
Thank you.

Next question from Nick Holmes, Société Générale. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 21515144 <GO>}

Hi. Thank you very much. I just wanted to come back on the GI expenses. A lot of your
peers seem to be focusing on direct insurance. And really, you don't seem to be doing
this nearly as much as some of the other major European insurers. I just wondered if you
could tell us a bit more about the rationale for this. Because, I mean, it does seem to be a
very obvious way of managing expenses down. Thank you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thanks for the question, Nick. So the – I mean, it's not as though it doesn't have the right
insurance businesses. It does. It has one in Italy. It has one in Germany. I mean, but our
focus is typically on a diﬀerent segment of the market. I mean, Zurich is a – in terms of a
Zurich proposition, we normally oﬀer more than simply the (33:22) lowest-touch possible

product. And therefore, I mean, you don't normally ﬁnd us compete at the bottom-end of
the market, on lowest-priced, lowest-cost product. It just doesn't ﬁt with us.
So we're looking to – I mean, we've been doing a lot of work over the last two years to
segment the portfolio. We look for the customers that we think the value proposition ﬁts
best and then particularly, (33:47). And it does mean that in some markets, we run a highexpense ratio. But of course, we look for customers to pay for that, and we look to provide
the customers with the service that that would imply. And I think given the way that we
operate an expansion – a wholesale expansion of the business into what's really a lowmargin business on the direct side, I'm not sure it would make much sense for us.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 21515144 <GO>}

Okay. So you don't think that in personal lines, direct is sort of some – the big question
mark in Continental Europe that could change personal lines quite dramatically?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

I guess that's a much broader and bigger question. It's a question, I think, that we would
see the model that we've seen elsewhere, for example, in the UK or maybe in these
essential things like GEICO or Progressive in the U.S., importantly. (34:44) I'm sure, to
some degree, you will.
But do I believe that's the only segment in the market that would be open to a company
like us? No, I don't. Do I believe that we can ﬁnd attractive returns in the segments that we
have the proposition to satisfy? I absolutely do. So it's not that I ignore it. It's not that I
think it's unimportant. But it's a segment of the market where I don't think we are
particularly well-equipped to compete and we don't target that particular area. So we're
looking at a diﬀerent sector.

Next question from Stefan Schürmann, Bank Vontobel. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Stefan Schürmann
Yes. Good afternoon. I have two questions. The ﬁrst one is on basically the survival ratio of
your asbestos book. Can you maybe update on that now after having added to reserves
and the – sort of the three-year survival ratio?
The second question is on basically claims inﬂation. I mean, you clearly state that the
claims inﬂation is running below your average rate increases, but I mean, do you see any
maybe increasing signs on the claims inﬂation side which is part of your statement that
you see basically more headwind from the market environment?

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So, on the ﬁrst one, I don't know the answer to the question. And in fact, just before we
started, I've realized that we have not yet answered the question. We'll have to get back,
Stefan, on that one.

FINAL

Q - Stefan Schürmann
Yes, sir.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Apology. On the claims inﬂation side, I mean, I guess the break spot for the time being is
that, I mean, claims inﬂation still doesn't seem to be a major issue with the rate and loss
costs still seem to be in reasonable balance in Q3. And there's – I mean, if we look around
the portfolio, we don't see signs that claims inﬂation is eminent.
But having said that, I think we have to be cautious and we have to be cautious in some
particular areas, I mean especially, obviously, the long tail ones that we're particularly
exposed to. But I guess part of the current environment is that the, I mean, the trends are
really driven by competition rather than claim inﬂection.

Q - Stefan Schürmann
Okay.

Next question is from Niccolo Dalla Palma, Exane BNP. Please, go ahead.

Q - Niccolo C. Dalla Palma

{BIO 16052945 <GO>}

Good afternoon, everyone. I have two questions. The ﬁrst one on Global Corporate,
earlier in the year – actually, Mike Kerner showed an interesting slide on where you are in
terms of the international programs around $3.8 billion and how it had been growing for
the last few years. I wonder whether you could give us an update on how that is growing
now. And any comment you can make on the competition from the reinsurance sector in
today's business or from new players? Or whether it's still something you feel only a very
few players can oﬀer? Hence, the growth is quite sustainable at those, close to doubledigit levels.

And the second question on the APH reserves strengthening whether you could tell us
which of the three letters it was. The reason I asked is there is some discussions on
industrial deafness claims in the UK. Is that the reason or is it the asbestos part? I can
follow up with the IR team later if necessary. Thank you.

FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

No. No need to follow up, because that one I know. On the ﬁrst one on the Global
Corporate side, let's come back for an update on the $3.8 billion, I don't have that at my
ﬁngertips. On the competitive environment and whether this is a diﬃcult sector to charge,
I mean there are very, very few people who can do what our Global Corporate business
does. It's an incredibly high-touch business that requires an immense global network.
I mean, our risk engineers and in some cases, almost looking at integrated part of the risk
management with some of our clients, so I think it's a very diﬃcult business to replicate
that requires – it's a heavy administrative burden not only from policy issuance through
claim settlement. It's clear to me that there are a number of people who'd like to be in
this, but I don't think it's easy at all. I think the barriers to entry to this particular group are
extremely high indeed.
On the APH side of things, I mentioned earlier that we've added just under $70 million to
APH in the UK and there's a bet on the A, so about $30 million is from the asbestos side,
and the remainder comes from health-related topics.

Next question from Marcus Rivaldi, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Marcus P. Rivaldi

{BIO 5739374 <GO>}

Good afternoon, everybody. So just coming back to the comments you made about
achieving strategy, I mean only a few months ago now, I think in London, the sense I got
was that there's a very high conﬁdence within the group of exceeding the bottom of your
target range and the sense I felt was you already have, at your disposal, lots of levers to
drive the R element of that to a point where you can be achieving that? The terms today
(40:10) clearly is a lot more, I think, cautious and I think I'm just confuse about the reasons
you're giving out for that. It seems to be very apparent and have been there for quite
some time. So I was wondering if you're going to comment about that.
Secondly, you also – I think, the half of your questions lots and lots about capital
management and you gave a sort of structure of how you think about capital
management. How's the managing the E moved up the agenda in terms of the priority list
there? And then ﬁnally, just a question on the numbers, on Global Life, of the Europe was
a major contributor to improvement in the Q. Is there any way you can give some sort of

Page 16 of 18

guidance, soft guidance with regards to your new sources of earnings, disclosure about
what was driving that, please. Thank you.

FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So on the – so ﬁrst one, achieving strategies. So apologies that I have caused confusion, I
think – I mean, this probably might be enough (41:06) for communication. I guess what
we're trying to do today to actually do in the (41:13) communication, something that I think
we've been doing in the one-on-ones already. I mean, it wasn't really an attempt to
change tone but it really was an attempt to make it clear to the market in general that we
recognize what I think everyone else recognizes that I mean it won't get easier from here.
But I mean, it was actually aimed to be a slightly positive message around a negative one
and that I mean, as you pointed out, around Q2, that was – and I clearly told and I think
everyone I met that we have the levers out on disposal, that we believe will be suﬃcient to
get us where we need to be.

Bloomberg Transcript

So I mean this wasn't an attempt to change direction or somehow signal some fear that
the targets are not achievable. I mean, actually it was the opposite. It was trying to signal
that we're realistic about what's taking place and we believe that in addition to the
realism, we actually have the tools at disposal to address the issues that that realism
brings; so apologies for the confusion.
On the capital management, has the E moved up the agenda, absolutely not. I mean, E is
always really high on the agenda. And net – I think that, I mean, it's typically very diﬃcult
in an insurance company context, particularly in Life, to make signiﬁcant changes in the
capital allocation and the current environment is going to be relatively painful. It's going
to cause volatility in the reported earnings that would not be welcome.
But having said that, I mean, because very few people do it, I think if you can do it, I think
there's a beneﬁt to be had so I mean I'm a ﬁrm believer that managing the E is actually
more important than anything else for the business. So, if we look at the capitals
allocated, it has a return that generated, but E is just really high on my list of priorities all
the time.
Sorry. The last one was Global Life, but I didn't catch the question, Marcus. Could you
repeat it for me?

Q - Marcus P. Rivaldi

{BIO 5739374 <GO>}

Yes, certainly. So you just oﬀ the – Europe was a major driver for the improvement during
Q3 this year. And I was just wondering if you could give maybe some color around the
new sources of earnings disclosure. What may have been driving that particularly?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So I apologize. I can't connect it back to the source of earnings for you. We are always –
we're focused on a number of areas trying to improve proﬁtability. That obviously beneﬁts

FINAL

us. But I mean, there is more going on into Global Life than simply Europe and some of
the improvements that we see in other parts of the business is somewhat massed.
So for example, I mean, we've had very substantial growth in the contribution from the
Zurich Santander business. But it's not so visible because of the impact of currency. And
of course, currencies are risk that we take right in that business. I mean from a longer-term
perspective, I would expect to see Latin America be a disproportionate contributor to
what we see in Global Life.
But on top of that, I expect Europe to continue. I mean, the large part of what Kristof and
the team are trying to do on the in-force management side is focused around Germany
and the UK. We believe we can be a bit more eﬃcient. We can tackle some issue around
asset allocation and we can look at capital. So I mean I expect to see some of that
continue.
But I mean, apologies, I can't connect it back to the source of earnings for you.

Q - Marcus P. Rivaldi

Okay. Thank you very much.
