Welcome to the presentation of Topdanmark's results for the ﬁrst half of 2019. Proﬁt for
the ﬁrst half was DKK 831 million, up from DKK 630 million in the ﬁrst half last year due to
an improved nonlife and life result. The combined ratio improved from 80.7% compared
to 85.5% in the ﬁrst half last year. Premiums increased by 2.6% in both life and nonlife.
For the full year 2019, the assumed combined ratio has improved from between 86% and
87% to between 85% and 86% excluding any runoﬀ in the second half of the year.

Bloomberg Transcript

The proﬁt forecast model for 2019 remains unchanged between DKK 1.250 billion and
DKK 1.350 billion, excluding runoﬀ in the remainder of the year. These are the main points
of my presentation.
Pretax earnings increased by DKK 287 million to DKK 1.066 billion. The technical nonlife
proﬁt increased by DKK 243 million to DKK 904 million. The improvement was due to a
higher -- to higher runoﬀ proﬁts and a lower claims trend, especially on the SME and
agricultural business. On the other hand, the discounting had a negative impact on the
technical result due to a lower yield curve.
Investment return in the nonlife decreased by DKK 73 million to minus DKK 75 million. The
negative investment result was accounting-wise impacted negatively by DKK 260 million
due to a lower volatility adjustment component, primarily as a consequence of a change
in the method of calculation.
Proﬁt in life insurance increased by DKK 113 million to DKK 219 million due to a higher
investment return and an improved risk result. The claims trend improved 4.7percentage
points to 64.1% in the ﬁrst half this year. Adjusted for runoﬀ proﬁts, weather-related claims,
large-scale claims and other positions, including changes of risk margin, the claims trend
improved by 1percentage points to 69%. The claims trend improved because of a lower
level of claims in all major product lines, except house, illness and accident and workers'
comp insurance.
Furthermore, the yield curve used for discounting the reserves was lower compared to the
ﬁrst half last year, having a negative impact on the claims trend of 0.5percentage point.

FINAL

Premiums increased by 2.6% in nonlife. The premium growth was split between a 1.2%
increase in the private segment and a 4.2% increase in the SME segment. We continue to
assume a premium growth for 2019 higher than the growth of 1.7% in 2018. As stated, the
combined ratio was 80.7% in the ﬁrst half of 2019, an improvement from 85.5% in the
same period last year.
For the full year, we have adjusted the assumed combined ratio from between 86% and
87% to between 85% and 86%, excluding runoﬀ in the second half of the year. This
improvement is caused by the positive development in Q2, with runoﬀ proﬁts, a lower
level of large-scale and weather-related claims than assumed.
Proﬁt in life insurance increased DKK 113 million to DKK 219 million because of a higher
investment return and an improved result on insurance risk. For 2019, the assumed proﬁt
on life insurance has been upgraded by DKK 50 million to between DKK 300 and DKK
330 million. In the life company, premiums increased 2.6%, split between a 9.1% growth in
regular premiums and a 0.4% decline in single premiums.

Bloomberg Transcript

Adjusted for the loss of the distribution agreement with Nykredit, premiums increased by
5.1%. Single premiums decreased in the ﬁrst half of 2019 due to the implementation of a
new IT platform, which, as planned, caused a temporary stop in the inﬂow of single
premiums.
For 2019, the assumed growth in regular premiums continues to be around 10%.
Excluding life and adjusted for revaluation and return on nonlife insurance provisions, the
investment return for the Topdanmark Group was minus DKK 4 million. This includes the
result of the Topdanmark's asset management company of DKK 42 million. The
investment return was aﬀected by the change in the method for calculation of the VA
component and a market-based reduction in the VA component, which had a negative
one-oﬀ eﬀect of DKK 260 million. The changes in the VA component is solely an
accounting issue and has no impact on the cash ﬂow in Topdanmark.
Based on a number of assumptions described in the Q2 report, the assumed post-tax
proﬁt for 2019 remains unchanged between DKK 1.250 billion and DKK 1.350 billion,
excluding runoﬀ in the second half of the year, representing earnings per share of DKK 15.
