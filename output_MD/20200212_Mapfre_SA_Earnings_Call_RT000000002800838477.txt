Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Thank you, Natalia. And hello, everyone. It is a pleasure to be here with you for the
presentation of our 2019 full year results. Looking at the key figures. For the period, our
top line is growing at a good pace. Revenue is up over 7%, mainly due to the rising
premiums and also the rallying financial markets.
Overall, premiums are up 2.2%, with Non-Life growing nearly 3% and Life premiums
stable. The combined ratio was 97.6%, similar to previous year. Performance has been
excellent at the insurance units where the combined ratio stood at 96.5% with 130 basis
points reduction compared to last year. The net result of the EUR609 million is up by 15%.
And excluding goodwill write-downs, the net result was nearly EUR675 million, down
around 4%.
As we announced in December, the fourth quarter results had a large impact from the
Japanese typhoons and riots in Chile, which mainly affected the Reinsurance unit.
Shareholders' equity is up nearly 11% mainly as a result of the fall in interest rates. The
ROE excluding the goodwill write-downs, would have been slightly over 8%. Our capital
position continues to be strong with the solvency II ratio at over 194% at the close of
September, in line with our target.

FINAL

On the next slide, we'll take a look at the key figures by business unit. On the right side,
you can see the main figures. Regarding attributable result, I would like to highlight the
contribution from our insurance units. They reached EUR806 million. Iberia continues to be
the largest profit contributor with a net result of nearly EUR500 million, up 3.6%.
LATAM reached an attributable result of EUR215 million, up 37%, with strong
improvements in Brazil and Mexico. International reached around EUR94 million, nearly
doubling last year's results with a strong turnaround in the United States with the largest
result in six years.
I would like to point out the reduction of over 1 point in the combined ratio in the
international unit and nearly 4 points in LATAM while Iberia remains stable. All in all,
insurance operations combined ratios stood at an excellent 96.5%. MAPFRE RE results
were affected by typhoons Faxai and Hagibis and the riots in Chile with a total impact of
around EUR127 million. And the GLOBAL RISKS segment has also been impacted by large
losses this year.
In the system business, excluding the goodwill write-downs and restructuring charges
taken in the third quarter, there was a net loss of around EUR12 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

On the next slide, we'll take a look at the main drivers of the net result. The result before
taxes and minorities is down 4%, 11% excluding goodwill write-downs. Please note that
these impairments were booked in the Non-Life financial result last year. While this year
they were booked in other activities.
The Non-Life result is in line with the previous year. There had been strong improvements
in Brazil, North America and LATAM North. Even when excluding last year extraordinary
impacts in Brazil and USA, the underlying improvements have been significant. The NonLife result has also benefited from higher realized gains, mainly at MAPFRE RE.
Life results are down by EUR67 million. This is explained by the non-recovering reversal of
a provision in 2018 for EUR130 million in Brazil. Excluding this impact, underlying results are
up year-on-year as growing volumes are mitigating the increase in commissions in the
bancassurance channel. Regarding Iberia, Life performance is strong with a EUR57 million
increase in results.
The results of other activities has fallen EUR97 million due to first restructuring charges
and losses at MAPFRE ASISTENCIA, especially in the travel insurance business in France,
the UK and Belgium; second, increased expenses from strategic initiatives across the
group, mainly digitalization and innovation; and third, lower financial result of other
activities in Brazil, due to the excess of cash in 2018 for the Banco do Brasil acquisition.
Regarding taxes. In Iberia, there was a positive extraordinary tax impact as a result of
deductions from previous year booked in 2019 once all fiscal requirements were fulfilled.
In Brazil, there has been a reduction in the corporate tax rate as well as a lower effective
tax rate in the agricultural segment.

FINAL

Please turn to Slide 5 to look at the adjusted net result. For the second year in a row, we
had large cat losses affecting results with two more typhoons and the heaviest rain
storms in Spain since 2012. Regarding large manmade losses, the Chilean riots had an
almost EUR24 million net impact, mostly at MAPFRE RE. The reorganization of the US
operations had a positive net impact of EUR13 million this year compared to EUR7 million
loss last year.
2019 results had a positive EUR30 million net effect, mainly derived from the already
explained tax deductions in Iberia. We will -- write-downs this year include EUR66 million at
MAPFRE ASISTENCIA booked in the third quarter, and there were several important real
estates gains last year for around EUR51 million. And this year net real estate gains are
smaller and were booked mainly in the fourth quarter.
On the other hand, 2019 market conditions in the last quarter were favorable and we
finished this year with EUR120 million of net realized gains on financial investments, up
EUR36 million compared to last year. Excluding all these impacts, the adjusted net result is
down by around 3% to EUR671 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

Please turn to Slide 6. On the left, you can see the breakdown of the capital structure with
-- which amounted to EUR13.1 billion. Our credit metrics remain quite strong with leverage
up slightly to around 22.7%. However, we feel comfortable with this current level, given our
solid and high-quality capital position.
As you can see on the bottom left, the EUR300 million increase in debt corresponds to
new bank financing to fund 2019 acquisitions. The most relevant were the expansion of
our agreement with Bankia for the BMN businesses and the agreement with Banco
Santander in Spain. The cost of new debt was well below 1%.
On the next slide, we will take a look at our equity. Shareholders' equity is up around 11%,
reaching nearly EUR8.9 billion. The most relevant changes apart from results that
dividends are first: a EUR715 million increase of unrealized gains in the available for sale
portfolio, net of shadow accounting driven by the sharp fall in rates; and second, the
appreciation of the U.S. dollar and to a lesser extent the Mexican peso which offset the fall
in the Brazilian real and the Turkish lira.
On the bottom right, you can see the detail of the available for sale portfolio in Iberia,
which represents three quarters of MAPFRE's total available for sale portfolio. As you can
see, the majority of the group's unrealized gains are in immunized portfolios.
Please turn to Slide 8. On this slide, you have the solvency II information. As you can see,
the figures are pretty stable and there are no relevant changes to discuss.
Please turn to the next slide. On the right, you can see that assets under management
are up nearly 9% driven by improvements in stock and debt markets as well as currency
effects. We are also seeing positive net inflows in both pension and mutual funds. The
breakdown of the investment portfolio is on the left. Asset allocation has been stable

Page 3 of 22

Date: 2020-02-12

throughout the year and exposure to government and corporate debt remains mostly
unchanged.

FINAL

Largest exposures correspond to Spanish sovereign debt for a little over EUR18 billion,
and Italian debt around EUR2.9 billion. This investment are mainly held in immunized
portfolios.
Realized gains in the Euro area reached nearly EUR178 million. And in Iberia, they reached
EUR118 million, up EUR9 million, while, in MAPFRE RE, they reached EUR60 million, up by
EUR24 million. We continue with our cautious stance regarding asset sales as we prefer to
protect the recurring deal. So most of the gains have been in equity.
Please turn to the next slide. We have disclosed new information that some of you
requested in the past, separating burial from the other Non-Life portfolios.

Bloomberg Transcript

As you can see, burial is a long tail business where we apply a similar ALM strategy as in
the Life business. Regarding the Euro area actively managed portfolios. Accounting yields
are still relatively high, given the current market context, 1.95% in Non-Life and 3.5% in Life.
Nevertheless, the downward trend should continue to impact financial income. We are
mitigating this low deal trend by a slightly increasing duration.
As you can see, accounting yields in other main geographies are still well above those in
Europe, although we saw a sharp decrease in rates in Brazil in 2019. Duration are
particularly low in Brazil and LATAM North, which gives us room to take advantage of any
potential deal increases.
Please turn to the next slide. Before we move on to explain the business units in more
depth, I would like to take a moment to talk about MAPFRE's commitment to sustainability,
which is part of our DNA. We have been signatories to the UN Global Compact since
2004, and are committed to the UN's principles for sustainable insurance and responsible
investments, and of course, the UN 2030 agenda.
Regarding the environment, our goal is to be carbon neutral worldwide by 2030 and by
2021 in Iberia. We integrate environmental criteria in our underwriting and investing.
Quality employment and diversity are also very important for MAPFRE. Over 97% of
employees worldwide have permanent contracts. We also have targets to promote
women and have inclusion policies. We recently launched the first fund in Europe for the
inclusion of people with disabilities, which has been listed as best practice in the UN
Global Compact.
Please turn to the next slide. Let's start with Iberia. In Spain, Non-Life premium growth has
been excellent and we have outperformed the market for the last 10 consecutive
quarters. Growth in Life protection has been exceptional, up 10% year-on-year.
Regarding the motor business. Premiums are up 1.3% with good trends in both retail and
fleets in Spain. The combined ratio 93.7%, solid ratio in a very competitive market where
Page 4 of 22



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity
Date: 2020-02-12

we've seen some pricing pressure. We've seen rising claims costs affecting, property
damage and slightly rising frequency trends in full coverage products.

FINAL

In General P&C, growth was mostly driven by homeowners and condominiums, which
were up by around 5% and 9%, respectively. The combined ratio improved 1.6 percentage
points, thanks to homeowners and commercial lines. There was a negative impact in the
last two quarters as a result of the severe rain and storms in the Mediterranean area.
The improvement of the results of other Non-Life is due to strong improvements in
general TPL. The Life-Savings result has increased by EUR28 million, and this is explained
by three factors: first, realized gains are up EUR18 million mainly driven by asset sales
from surrenders; second, this year's results include the new Bankia subsidiaries acquired
in 2019; and finally, also in 2019, there was a high level of provisioning for actuary tables
compared to this year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Let's now take a look at Brazil. Premiums grew 2% in local currency with excellent
performance in Life Protection, Agricultural and Multi-Risk segments. There was a fall in
motor premiums as a result of greater underwriting discipline and cancellation of lossmaking accounts. The net result amounting to EUR97 million, up nearly EUR43 million. The
Non-Life result is up around EUR60 million, partly due to the absence of extraordinary
negative adjustments, but the underlying result also improved.
The largest profit contributor was in this year General P&C. Losses in motor are down with
a 7 percentage point reduction in combined ratio, thanks to stricter claims management,
greater underwriting discipline and new pricing tools. As we already explained at the
beginning of this presentation, profit benefited as well from a tax reduction.
Please turn to the next slide. In LATAM North, I would like to comment on the solid local
currency growth trends and the extraordinary combined ratio, which stands at 94.7% in a
better currency environment. We continue to develop a multi-channel approach in the
region, reaching new agreements with new financial institutions. Excluding the multi-year
Pemex policy, Mexico has had strong local currency growth of 16% driven by Life and
Property segments. The motor combined ratio improved over 6 percentage points to
below 95%, thanks to tariff and risk selection measures.
In Central America, the combined ratio has improved as well, as results are up. Panama,
Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are all seeing solid growth and profitability trends. In
the Dominican Republic, premiums are up 12% in local currency and the combined ratio
continues improving. Technical performance in Life protection was also very good.
Please turn to the next slide. Regarding LATAM South, we've seen excellent local currency
trends, but with some volatility. Average exchange rates from -- for the Argentine, Chilean
and Colombian pesos are down year-on-year, while the Peruvian sol is up over 4%.
Local currency growth is good in most of our main markets, and we continue developing
bancassurance operations and new agreements with car manufacturers.

FINAL

Peru shows excellent premium growth, especially in Life Savings. And in Colombia,
financial performance has been excellent in the annuity run-off portfolio with a better ALM
policy after restructuring the investment portfolio in July this year. We do not expect
further negative impact going forward. Results in Chile were impacted by the riots with a
nearly EUR4 million net impact.
The following results is explained by the 2018 real estate gains. Excluding this impact,
underlying results have been rather stable despite a higher combined ratio in motor. And
Argentina is currently affected by the hyperinflationary economy is doing very well.
Let's move to North America. The appreciation of the dollar has positively impacted both
premiums and results. Premiums are down around 9% in local currency as a result of the
exit from five states in 2018 and also the non-renewal of commercial lines in all states but
Massachusetts starting this year.
The attributable result is up over EUR49 million in the U.S. Last year was affected by
extraordinary winter weather as well as the cost of the exit of the five states. 2019 results
are benefiting from a EUR13 million net positive adjustments already discussed at the
second quarter. And excluding extraordinary impacts, underlying results have improved
over EUR17 million.

Bloomberg Transcript

Outside the Northeast, we've seen a reduction in losses and combined ratios across the
regions. And finally, positive profitability trends continue in Puerto Rico with over EUR20
million in results and a combined ratio below 91%.
Please turn to the next slide. Italy continues with strong improvements in the combined
ratio, down 3 percentage points. It is also important to mention that Italy is already
delivering over EUR2 million in profit on a standalone basis, I mean, without excluding
consolidation adjustments. As we announced last quarter, we're working on the process
of transforming our Italian entity into a VERTI Spain brand under EU regulations. The plan is
a little bit behind schedule, but it's moving forward.
In Turkey, we are still seeing a drag from exchange rates. We continue with our defensive
business model, reducing our MTPL exposures. The net result continues in positive
territory, but it is still down compared to last year. The drivers behind the falling results
are: first, inflation and currency depreciation, which are having a negative impact on spare
parts, and other claims costs, partially offset by investment in euros; and second,
MAPFRE's participation in the compulsory high risk MTPL pool which has had a negative
impact of EUR5 million, mainly booked in the second quarter this year.
In Germany, premium trends continued to be positive with an improving result and
resilient combined ratio.
Please turn to next slide, I will now hand over the call to Eduardo Perez de Lema.

FINAL

Thank you, Fernando, and pleasure to join you this morning. Concerning the performance
of MAPFRE RE in 2019. Premiums are up by 12% fueled by the reinsurance units, particularly
on the Non-Life business. Growth comes mainly through increases in shares on our key
client relationships, one large transaction in the US for the group and also is benefiting
from currency movements, especially for -- from the US dollar.
On the other hand, the Global Risks segment, premiums declined mainly due to the
transfer of the portfolio that MAPFRE Global Risks used to write through their European
branches to the reinsurance unit, which offsets the very strong pricing momentum on the
retained portfolio initiated in the second half year of 2019.
We continue working on the non-renewal of unprofitable business in the Global Risks
segment. And as we announced recently, we discontinued underwriting facultative
business in our London branch. As for the Life business, the fall is due to the timing
difference on certain large transactions. The combined ratio has been affected by several
large claims that exceed our annual large loss budget.

Bloomberg Transcript

The most relevant pre-tax impacts include the Japanese typhoons for EUR151.5 million,
the riots in Chile for EUR28 million, another number of large claims that almost amount
EUR80 million for -- compared to EUR65 million in 2018 and also the impact on our
agricultural business of the Brazilian drought that impacted almost with EUR15 million.
There also has been an increase in frequency of attritional claims compared to an
exceptionally low level that we had in 2018.
The results of the Life business is down due to the reduction in the financial income. The
underlying profitability of the portfolio, the Life portfolio remains strong. As for the -- for
net financial gains before tax are up by nearly EUR25 million, reaching EUR60 million in
2019.
Now I would like to switch to next slide where we would like to review the outcome of our
January non-group treaty renewals. As you know at year-end, we renew most of our nongroup treaty portfolio. In premium terms that represents above 75% of our premiums.
In general terms, it has been a very positive campaign for MAPFRE RE. We achieved
overall growth of more than 10% on our premiums while we were able to improve our
underlying profitability on our portfolio that we already consider to be balanced and
healthy. This was achieved both through moderate risk adjusted pricing increases on parts
of the portfolio, pruning of certain underperforming treaties and further lines of business
diversification.
We also were able to renew our Restoration Program with some optimization of our
structure, keeping stable retention levels, long-standing support from our main
counterparts and pricing changes that are in line with the ones obtained in our business.
Now I would like to hand back the floor to Fernando.

FINAL

Thank you, Eduardo. Quite clear, simple explanation regarding MAPFRE RE's figures.
On Slide 17, you can see the results from MAPFRE ASISTENCIA as well as the breakdown
of extraordinary items and underlying results by business region and product line. On the
left, you have the breakdown of the gross operating result excluding write-downs and
restructuring costs. As you can see the losses are concentrated in three countries, in the
travel insurance business, while most of the other operations are delivering positive
results. As we announced last quarter, we will continue streamlining the organizational the
structure exiting five countries. And going forward, the ASISTENCIA business will be
simpler and for sure, more efficient.
Please turn to the next slide for the closing remarks. Performance of the insurance
business has been outstanding, reaching a net result of over EUR800 million, up 18%. This
is our core business. The combined ratio of the insurance units fell to 96.5%, thanks to our
profitable growth strategy.

Bloomberg Transcript

MAPFRE RE will continue to be an important contributor to our earnings and a strategic
unit over the cycle and will reduce exposures in Global Risks in order to lower volatility. We
continue to be focused on technical excellence and profitable growth across the group.
We are an insurance company and our profits are mainly from the underwriting result.
Financial income is a complement to our technical result, but not our main goal.
Nevertheless, we have a privileged portfolio with our market deals and a significant buffer
of unrealized capital gains.
We will continue to create value for our shareholders, streamlining operations to increase
efficiency and profitability. Going forward, our transformation process is key based on
investing in innovation and digitalization.
Thank you for your attention. Now I will hand the floor over to Natalia.

(Question And Answer)
Thank you, Fernando. Thank you, Eduardo. Now we kind of start with Q&A session. First
question comes from Ivan Bokhmat at Barclays; Sofia Barallat at CaixaBank BPI. They have
asked regarding the positive tax impact register in this quarter. Should we expect any
recurring benefit from low tax rate offset in 2019, particularly in Spain?

FINAL

Thank you, Ivan and Sofia. I already know this is the -- what is going to be the first question
of the Q&A. This is the key extraordinary impact that we booked in the quarter and also
an important driver for results as well. As explained in the presentation this one, as this tax
issue was a one-off positive net impact.
The net was EUR13.2 million, and mainly was the result of the correction of double taxation
with regards to profit from MAPFRE Vida subsidiaries for previous fiscal years, mainly 2013
to 2016. The double taxation was a result of a complex interpretation of the law
applicable at this time, which is no longer enforced. And profits from this subsidiary were
non-taxable as the sale price, at the moment of the acquisition that we paid to the seller
including future profits. And the seller already paid taxes on this comp set because it was
realized gains for the seller, when accounting for the gain from this transaction.

Bloomberg Transcript

Since 2017, our tax audit is being carried out by the tax authorities. We expect this tax
audit to end in any week but very soon in the future. And the main problem is that we had
to wait for the routine ordinary tax audit to be completed before filing for this correction. I
mean during the moment the tax audit has been done, we can file additional or correcting
tax return in order to correct the mistake of the error.
So at the end of this quarter and once we obtain the proper tax fiscal documentation
from the seller for the third-parties, we agreed that it was 100% sure that this tax credit
will be affected in future tax return. So as well and since the tax audit was currently being
done by the tax authority, we reached with the tax authorities in this interpretation. And so
the relevant deductions were booked and apply in 2019. The EUR13 million is the net
effect of approximately EUR40 million tax credit and other some between 50 and 20 tax
liability, and also other extraordinary tax impacts were booked during the first and second
quarters in 2019. It's very complex, but I think this explanation -- I mean, will help you, I
mean, to understand this taxation.

A - Natalia Nunez

{BIO 22192909 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Fernando. This question goes to Eduardo, and it's coming from
Niccolo Dalla Palma at Exane. He would like to know your annual large loss budget to
which you make reference on Slide 18.

A - Eduardo Perez de Lema

{BIO 20385404 <GO>}

Well, we disclosed that figure on the Investors Day last year, the large loss figure that we
that -- the budget that we had is EUR275 million pre-tax for the reinsurance unit only. That
doesn't include the GLOBAL RISKS portfolio which is different. And last year, what we had
in 2019 is pretty similar to 2018. Actually on the cat side of losses is almost exactly the
same figure because both years we stopped our cat losses and the deductible of both
our occurrence and frequency covers. So both years are very similar in size in terms of cat
events. On the GLOBAL RISKS side, the large loss figure was significantly higher in 2019
compared to 2018.

Thank you very much, Eduardo. Next question comes from Ivan Bokhmat at Barclays and
Sofia Barallat at CaixaBank BPI have sent these questions regarding gains. What run rate
do you anticipate for 2020? Should 2019 serve as a reasonable base? Do you reiterate
your guidance of EUR100 million of realization gains per year?

FINAL

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you, Ivan and Sofia. As we already explained and in previous presentation,
realized gains for MAPFRE are permanent source income in our results. But as you know,
our financial targets are focused. And I said on of technical profitability, we focus on
underlying results. Financial results particularly realized capital gains are a complement. I
know that the number is pretty high because we have a lot of exposures on equities, but
we should assume that this is a more complement of our underwriting results.

Bloomberg Transcript

Over the last three years, we will reach a significant net realized gains. The range is
between EUR120 million, EUR130 million more or less net of tax with a combination of
both real estate and also financial investment gains. As I said at the third quarter and
fourth quarter presentation, we had as available-for-sale some large units in the real
estate markets and we expected to complete some of this transaction. Unfortunately, we
didn't do it and the offer we got, they were enough, I mean, for us to take it. And so as
you may see, the figure for real estate gains is quite modest. It's just above EUR10 million,
including part of the release of provisions.
On the other hand, 2018 was quite active in terms of real estate gains. And if I remember
well, the amount was over EUR50 million with relevant units sold in particular in Chile. The
units that we expected to sell in the fourth quarter, that is still in the market and the
relevant ones. And we are pretty optimistic that we can make some of them throughout
the 2020. Regarding the level. We consider EUR100 million net on realized gains a
reasonable level. This is mainly the track from previous year. This is the number that we
made in previous year.
Our portfolio is quite flexible and we can mix real estate and financial investment as well.
At the end of last year, we finished with nearly EUR50 million in unrealized gains on equity.
So we've got a good buffer for this 2020 year. We take advantage of market
opportunities as we said as well in equity and bond portfolios. Last quarter, the fourth
quarter was pretty good, I mean with the rally in the equity markets and we took
advantage of this situation. But anyway, we maintain a prudent approach to gains and
talking about the bonds, and we prefer not to touch our fixed income portfolio because
our main goal is to protect our recurring ordinary deals and to protect recurring financial
income.
Thank you very much, Fernando. Next question is for Eduardo. Ivan Bokhmat at Barclays
asks do you believe the increased prices and better terms and conditions covered
increase in loss cost inflation and better costs for 2020? How much of a benefit to
combined ratio do you expect from January 1 renewals?

FINAL

Thank you. Well, what I would say, first of all is that we really don't expect any loss cost
inflation or loss creeps to affect us on the events that we had both in 2018 or 2019
because we are fully reserved up to the level of where our protections would attach.
We're not going almost into the protections, but we reserved that to the deductible. So
we don't expect any impact on or we wouldn't have any impact on loss inflation.
What refers to our retro cost for 2020, we didn't suffer significant retro cost improvement
-- increases, although, we know that the market has been tough in that part of the
industry. Main difference for us is that we haven't almost ceded any claims to our retro
program since 2011. So our retro program has been profitable for our reinsurance, so we
didn't have to go through massive adjustments. What refers to the wider market, we
haven't seen really hard market across the whole reinsurance market. We have been
seeing improvements. We have seen some segments where there have been massive
price increases, but not across the whole market. I would say the portfolio overall is
somewhat better than the year before, but not massively different to what we had
before. To measure that in terms of combined ratio is a very difficult one and not easy to
answer. I would say with the current portfolio, we think we can achieve margin levels in line
with the historical profitability of MAPFRE RE. That's what I would say right now.

Thank you very much, Eduardo. Next question comes from Niccolo Dalla Palma is
regarding Brazil. The first one is pricing minorities. How much of the EUR230 million
minorities can we attribute to the non-life business and how much to the life business?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Thank you, Niccola. After the restructuring of shareholdings with Banco do Brasil, the final
agreement with MAPFRE and Banco do Brasil. The minorities are mainly in the agricultural
and life protection business. I mean, we're running both line of business as well in MAPFRE
channel or in the MAPFRE 100% shareholding. But the majority of the agricultural, we have
25 agricultural and life protection, majority, we have a 25% economic shareholding. You
can find the attributable result net of minorities by line of business for Brazil on the
presentation.
As you may notice, I mean, we don't disclose line of business by Bancassurance channel
and MAPFRE channel because is also reported. I mean the numbers in a separate
presentation. So basically, this is the information that we can give you at the moment. But
any additional information, we will get back to you after the call and Natalia will give you
more explanation.

A - Natalia Nunez

{BIO 22192909 <GO>}

Sure. Thank you, Fernando. This one is the Brazil combined ratio. How much of the 92.2%
is due to a better than normal year in the agro segment? How would you quantify the
normalized combined ratio for the region?

FINAL

Well, first of all, we're extremely happy with the 92% combined ratio in Brazil. If -remember at the Investor Day, we said that the combined ratio target for the three-year
period was 96%. Unfortunately, I mean we're still working on automobile, which is with
combined ratios well above 100%. But on the remaining line of business combined ratio is
well below the combined ratio target of 96%.
So the improvement in general P&C combined ratio is driven by basically the several line
of business, transport and other retail multiple lines as well. And from a combined ratio
perspective, I mean 2019, it wasn't a great year for agricultural due to the droughts and
rains during the first half of the year. My view is that it doesn't make sense to talk about a
normalized combined ratio at reinsurance since this particular line of business is subject to
a lot of volatility because there are seasonal effects throughout the year. So I don't think
it's correct, I mean, to talk about the combined ratio, normalized.

A - Eduardo Perez de Lema

{BIO 20385404 <GO>}

And also if you allow me to jump in on this one. On this agricultural segment in MAPFRE
Brazil, the businesses there is not only crops which is volatile by nature and we know that
and very well protected through insurance. But at the same time they have a large part of
the portfolio that is other kind of business of P&C linked to the agricultural sector that is
much more stable, and that will give -- it's very profitable and very -- giving -- very stable
results over time.

{BIO 22192909 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Eduardo. We continue with the questions regarding combined ratio
in Brazil. And the next one is the combined ratio, it comes from Edward Morris from JP
Morgan. The combined ratio appears to be running well ahead of the target 96% for the
group. 92.2% for full-year '19. What drove this? And do you see this as sustainable?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you, Edward. As I mentioned, general P&C ratio was the star last year and with
a significant improvement in this current year. On the other hand, the Motor combined
ratio is still pretty high well above 100, it is like 107%. I mean, let's say that we expect both
combined ratios, I mean, to convert in more reasonable long-run trends. So we are
keeping I mean, our objectives to lower combined ratio in automobile, in order to achieve
100% in the two remaining days -- years. But frankly, I mean, the general P&C combined
ratio, which is currently at 79%, to me sounds quite unsustainable in the future. So it's
quite similar to what happened in Spain as well. And probably we will see some increases
in P&C combined ratio in the future.

A - Natalia Nunez

{BIO 22192909 <GO>}

Thank you very much. We continue with the combined ratio topic in Brazil. On a quarterly
basis, MAPFRE Brazil's combined ratio deteriorated. Could you elaborate on the reasons
behind this performance?

FINAL

Yes. Thank you, Sofia. There were -- it was two relevant fact. I mean not very important,
but they affected the fourth quarter combined ratio results. First, it was the uptick in
growing insurance in the fourth quarter. And also it was a sliding commission adjustment
from reinsurance. We usually -- I mean, the standard in this industry is to wait till year-end
in order to slide -- to adjust the reinsurance slidig commission. So we booked this positive
effect at the end of the year. Eduardo?

A - Eduardo Perez de Lema

{BIO 20385404 <GO>}

Negative.

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Negative. Sorry. Positive -- I would like to -- positive effect, it was negative, sorry about
that.

A - Natalia Nunez

{BIO 22192909 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Now one more question regarding Brazil. Ivan Bokhmat at Barclays
has a following question. Interest rates in the country continued to come down along with
further ForEx headwind of weaker real versus euro. How much of an impact do you now
expect from lower investment result in 2020?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yes, Thank you Ivan. Our studies and research department is forecasting for next year for
2020 quite stable real rates. So we shouldn't expect a relevant impact on -- from currency
and also as well for I mean talking about the U.S., we expect the U.S. dollar to be quite
stable as well. On interest deal is completely different. And two years ago the Selic rate
was well above 12%. Currently, it's four point something and 4.2%, I guess. And so we
probably -- we expcet further reduction. We will depend on the current expectation of
GDP growth in emerging countries. And the current situation worldwide is quite difficult, I
mean, to see what is going to happen in Brazil. In any case as we disclosed in our
presentation, in Brazil is pretty low, and we're still keeping a good accounting deal, well
above 5%. So we can take advantage of any further market opportunities to keep a deal
or to increase rates, increase in duration.

A - Natalia Nunez

{BIO 22192909 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much. Now we have one question also for Eduardo. Paz Ojeda at
Sabadell has this question USA, MAPFRE RE. Could you confirm your exposure to the U.S.
casualty business? Do you think that the increase in results could be a risk for you as we
are seeing in other insurance companies?

A - Eduardo Perez de Lema

{BIO 20385404 <GO>}

Well, specifically on our reinsurance portfolio, the exposure is nil. We don't write any US
casualty at all and never have done it. So we don't have any exposure to that one, right
now and not foreseeing to have it. I can cover also the insurance side. I would say for what
we are seeing in the U.S. casualty development, doesn't affect also our insurance
operation. Our insurance operation is almost exclusively a personal lines operation, very
Page 13 of 22

heavy driven by motor. And we are not seeing that impact that's severely our insurance
portfolio either. So I think, it's a significant market trend, but not a MAPFRE event.

FINAL

A - Natalia Nunez

{BIO 22192909 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Eduardo. We have now a question that it has a lot of people asking
about that is Niccolo Dalla Palma, Edward Morris, Ivan Bokhmat. They want to know more
about 2019, 2021 targets. You said, you could update on your public objectives. What can
you tell us about the new objectives? What indicators are you most concerned about?
Should we expect a 10% ROE target will revise down to 9% or lower? Could you update
on your view of the 96% combined ratio target? And how much of the underperformance
this year has been driven by one-offs versus structural factors? So tough questions, but I
guess you can group them.

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Thank you, everybody. I mean I expected this question as well anyway. And as we
said in previous presentations and also is included in the relevant fact filed with the CNMV
at the -- in December. If any, I mean we will update our targets and objectives for the
strategic -- three-year strategic plan at the AGM. Having said that, I mean we shouldn't
expect any relevant change in the basic the KPIs. I mean KPIs, I we publish that mean for
our strategic plan is the basic of the insurance industry, and we will keep talking about the
combined ratio, total shareholder return, net equity, premium growth and so on.
And we're currently analyzing and we have to present first to the board and then to the
AGM is if there is any change in the metrics regarding these indicators, which is the more,
the toughest. And as we mentioned, I mean, ROE seems to be quite tough at the current
moment, at the current situation due to the extraordinary events that we suffered during
the first year of the new strategic plan. But then, frankly, we will give you more color at the
AGM. At the moment I mean, that's what I can say. That's it.

A - Natalia Nunez

{BIO 22192909 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Fernando. One more question about MAPFRE RE and from Paz from
Sabadell. In addition to the cancellation of facultative intra insurance, have you planned
any other restructuring or cancellation measures?

A - Eduardo Perez de Lema

{BIO 20385404 <GO>}

Yes. Mthank you, Paz. First of all, we have discontinued facultative reinsurance in London
only. We continue writing facultative business elsewhere and we will continue to do so. We
discontinued our facultative book in London, because obviously, results haven't been
good. That's a fact. But also it didn't strategically fit into the portfolio under the new
structure of MAPFRE RE and MAPFRE GLOBAL RISKS. We see other places where we can
deploy our capital more efficiently. So that was the reason why we canceled our
reinsurance operation in facultative.
Apart from that, there is no plan for a major restructuring anywhere else. What we do is
we review constantly our portfolio and our individual relationships. And where we see
profitability or margin issues, we try to negotiate restructuring of treaties or better terms.
Page 14 of 22



FINAL

Company N ame: M apfre SA

And if that is not possible, we eventually cancel our relationship. We had quite a few of
them during renewal season that were under review. We can say, fortunately enough
especially in some markets that were under review, we were able to obtain
improvements in conditions and structures that allow us to continue on the treaty, but this
is a normal work that we have to do every year on our portfolio. So to answer the
question, there is no plans for further restructuring or cancellation structurally on MAPFRE
RE. Of course, constantly, we review individual relationships and treaties and see how we
can obtain the margins that we need.

A - Natalia Nunez

{BIO 22192909 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Eduardo. Now one question from Niccolo Dalla Palma and it's
regarding Italy. Several years after the acquisition, the profitability is still quite poor. What
structural actions have you put in place to address this?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Thank you, Niccolo. First of all, I would like to elaborate a little bit longer regarding
Italy. As you remember, I mean Italy was a strategic acquisition at that point in 2015 if I
remember well. I mean rather than starting a digital business from scratch as we did in
Spain from VERTI, we acquired a company with a lot of structural inefficiency. It's clear, but
with a very good client-based platform in order to convert into digital business following
the Spanish VERTI standards. This is a process that is taking probably longer than we
expected, but it is moving forward and is following, I mean, the deadlines that we've set.
We have seen relevant technical improvements in Italy. The combined ratio is down 3
percentage points this year, but it is still I mean, it is above 100%. It means that the more
action has to be taken in order to reduce and to get an acceptable level. Local accounts,
as I said, Italy operation is reporting a good profit I mean, EUR2 million and also needs
generating cash. So let's say that the part of the is done and the turnaround is already
made.
Also we are investing in Italy. And as you know, there is a new IT platform that and also
some of the cost has been reduced, particularly the headcount in the past, and we're
quite positive with -- in the near future. And we believe that we could reduce -- we will be
able to reduce costs and also to convert into a profitable business. Transformation of
VERTI Italy at the moment is key, and we would like to have it converted this year into a
VERTI Spain branch under EU regulation. It will be an important driver to help consolidate
all the digital operations at the group level and also to take advantage of potential cost
savings and also synergies within MAPFRE Spain group.
Thank you very much, Fernando. We have now a question from Edward Morris from JP
Morgan, regarding the reinvestment portfolio. What is the investment rate on the fixed
income portfolio for non-life overall? Can you quantify the year-on-year headwind to your
financial income from the current level of interest rates? And what structural actions have
you put in place to address this?

Page 15 of 22



Company N ame: M apfre SA
Company Ticker: M AP SM Equity

FINAL

Yes. Thank you, Edward. First regarding expectation in the future, our survey and study
department as well, they're expecting the 10-year Spanish bond to be at the end of the
year nearly 70 basis point, which is an important increase compared to the 0.47% at the
beginning of the year. So the investment -- the reinvestment yield will be within this range
between 45 and 70 for Spanish bonds, and it will be higher for corporate bonds and also
for service in other countries.
You can see the figures for our main investment portfolio in Page 10 of our the
presentation. The non-deal is slightly under 2% and around 3.5% in life. Accounting yield
has decreased approximately 22 percentage points this year is one of the lowest for the
last five years. And it's part of the -- we're harvesting the fruit of protecting our recurring
deal in the past.
Regarding duration, we have increased duration not that much, I mean to mitigate the
falling rates. And you can see as well in the presentation. And as I mentioned particularly in
LATAM, we have still room to increase higher deal, diversifying portfolios with alternative
investments and also increasing the ratio, particularly in LATAM South. We have an over
EUR1 billion budget approved by the Board for alternative asset. Approximately EUR320
million, they're already been invested, and they're delivering yields, a good yield in our
balance sheet. And the majority of this investment, a large share of this investment is in
real estate, with yields between 4% and 4.5%.

{BIO 22192909 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much. Now we have one more question for Eduardo Perez de Lema,
Alfredo Alonso at BBVA has sent two questions. How are the measures taken on GLOBAL
RISKS affecting the performance in 4Q '19? What are your expectations going forward? Is
the improvement in premium sustainable?

A - Eduardo Perez de Lema

{BIO 20385404 <GO>}

What, I would say, well, the measures taken on GLOBAL RISKS are starting to see -- we're
starting to see them. Unfortunately, on insurance and reinsurance, things take a bit longer
to go through the accounts. But very clearly we are seeing specifically on that segment
that is what I said before in general for reinsurance industry, it's not exactly a hard market
yet. But specifically on the segments that MAPFRE GLOBAL RISKS is operating is
significantly harder market or we could also call a hard market. And our expectations are
positive on the outcome of that specific part of the portfolio because really there, the
conditions have changed dramatically since mid last year and very significantly into
renewals into 2020. So with the conditions that we are seeing on renewals depending on
segments, but are very significantly different today than they were a year ago, and that
will definitely go through the accounts.
Regarding how sustainable those improvements are, I would say they need to be
sustainable because the good or bad thing is that it's not MAPFRE GLOBAL RISKs
probably. I mean it's an industry-wide problem. And across the industry, the results have
been poor in that segment for a long time, and I think, there is a very clear message
everywhere that there is a need for improvement and that to be sustainable. So we are
confident that on the portfolio that we will remain, we will see improved performance for
Page 16 of 22

FINAL

sure and that should be a little bit longer sustainable. And -- but at the same time, we
have to be aware that is probably the most volatile portfolio that this we have in our -- in
the company, and they're subject to large losses any time. Even with the best pricing, we
will see years with really outstanding performance. And yes, with that performance, yes,
depending on volatility of normal claims activity.

A - Natalia Nunez

{BIO 22192909 <GO>}

Thank you very much, Eduardo. Now we go to North America. Alfredo Alonso at BBVA has
the following question. What are the main reasons for the quarterly deterioration in North
America? What are your expectations going forward?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Thank you, Alfredo. Yes, it was a slight deterioration in the fourth quarter, but the context
was very positive. Let's say that there is a general improvement in the year in the United
States, and we're very happy with the performance given by this unit in 2019, and they
may be quite clear. I mean, let's say that the US has fulfilled the expectation that we have
for this year.

Bloomberg Transcript

Usually, the fourth quarter of the year is typically the quarter in the year because the
seasonality and also the winter effect. And usually there is snowstorms, freezing
temperature as well, and this is the main reason for this deterioration. Going forward, I
mean, we're still transforming our business in the U.S. As I said, in the presentation in 2018
was the exit of five states that we performed this year.
In 2019, we announced the non-renewal of commercial lines in all states but
Massachusetts. We are looking into and analyzing, I mean, our current footprint in the US.
And frankly, currently, there are three states in the radar. First is Arizona second is
Pennsylvania and the third is Florida. Pennsylvania had to clarify that Pennsylvania is the
state we were running VERTI operations. And we are looking into the traditional business
in Pennsylvania, which is running from the former commerce business.
Analyzing means that we are looking for different opportunities in order to find, I mean, a
solution to this loss making operations. And probably in the future -- in the near future, we
see there is appetite for other players in order to reduce our exposure in the U.S. with
further exits. Obviously, I mean the process is pretty low because we need some actions.
It requires some approvals from the supervisor in each state. But probably, I mean, we will
move forward in order to reduce our footprint in the states. I mean, the strategy is pretty
clear. Those states that they're loss making operations, and they don't achieve the
minimum size in order to be profitable in the future, they are in the radar. And the radar
means that we are looking for potential opportunities in the market, I mean, to find a final
solution.

very early. Are you expecting any impact from the adverse weather in So Paulo and Peru?
Or are these weather events in regions where you are not exposed to.

FINAL

A - Eduardo Perez de Lema

{BIO 20385404 <GO>}

Well, thank you. The easy question is we are exposed both in Brazil and in Peru to weather
events both on insurance and on reinsurance. But honestly, they happened two days ago,
I think. So it's extremely early to see where they exactly affected and to what extent. So
right now it's impossible to say, if there is any meaningful exposure to -- that can affect us.
My impression would be that it -- if any, it should be something within the attrition of
natural tariff exposure that we have in a given year, but I would be very careful with any
expectation on that.

A - Natalia Nunez

{BIO 22192909 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much, Eduardo. Now we are going to Iberia. We have some
questions coming from Ivan Bokhmat at Barclays, Alfred Alonso at BBVA, Paz Ojeda at
Sabadell and Sofia Barallat at Caixa BPI. They have the following questions regarding P&C
and Motor dynamics in Iberia. P&C combined ratio has increased in Q4 '19 despite
relatively mild weather. Could you talk about the dynamics in Motor segment in particular?
How much did you increase prices in 2019? And do you believe these covers pick-up in
frequency and severity? Should we still consider the 94% combined ratio to be a good
target for 2021. What are your expectations for motor insurance premiums in Iberia in
2020?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Yes. Thank you. Ivan Alfredo, Pat and Sophia. If I may disagree, in the fourth quarter it
wasn't mild weather. I mean we didn't have mild weather. Yes, the other hand, I DANA, we
that we call DANA, that was severe weather, big storms and rain over the Mediterranean
area and particularly affecting the south of Spain and also Catalonia. And the trends follow
us, as you probably are aware of. And January is still, I mean with a in terms of severe
weather over Catalonia. I should say it as well that most of the damages coming from this
severe weather are coverage by the consorcio which is the cat pool in Spain, particularly
wind and flood damages.
But anyway, I mean, the rain is affected the loss ratio in automobile because of the car
crashes and also more frequency in this business. Regarding the outlook and let's say that
-- to report to a combined ratio of below 94% in these circumstances, I think is very good.
And obviously there is an increase, but what it wasn't sustainable is combined ratio below
90% as we reported in previous years. The market is still very competitive with a lot of
pressure on prices. Probably you are aware, but two peers has worked on the large
competitors as well in out of the top 10, and they're reporting increases in loss ratio, and
also is being affected by a lot negative -- loss negative developments derived from the
variable which is not affecting MAPFRE, obviously.
Regards motor dynamics, as I mentioned, some increases. We have seen increases in
material damage claim costs as well as frequency. We consider this trend more structural
than temporal as a result of the aging over the Spanish fleet. 2019 figures regarding new

Page 18 of 22

FINAL

cars sold weren't good because of the lack of fiscal incentives in order to renew the fleet.
And also it's affecting -- the situation is affecting the Spanish fleet, which is the second
oldest in Europe, if I remember after Pol.
We consider the Motor combined ratio in a range between 94% and 92% to be
sustainable. The lower range will be perfect, I mean for expectations. But that we -- this
range we consider reasonable. And also we expect as well some volatility on a quarterly
basis because of the severe weather and also seasonality. And regarding pricing and
MAPFRE is focused on increasing our share in more experienced drivers. So there is a
slight decrease in average premium because those drivers that kind of reduced their
premium and we live in some segments of young people which is more difficult, I mean to
handle as well. And so this is the main reason for the decrease in premiums. Anyway, I
mean 2020 renewals in terms of price, we're increasing, I mean, based on inflation on
cost and also the increases of material damages basically LIBOR increases and also
increases in frequency.

A - Natalia Nunez

{BIO 22192909 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much. So more or less you have answered. The next question is
about how much of the deterioration in the combined ratio comes from pricing pressure.
Do you want to elaborate more on that?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

They are the three factors. I mean prices, they're very competitive, but also there is an
increase in frequency and also on cost as well on property damage.

{BIO 22192909 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much. Also we have a question from Sofia Barallat, Paz Ojeda, about
Gloria storm. Do you have any initial preliminary estimate on the potential losses related
with the damages resulting from the recent Gloria storm? Can we expect a similar impact
from that of the DANA?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

We do not have any estimation, but it won't be that big like the one that we had in
September and October. So we shouldn't expect any relevant impact from those storms.

A - Natalia Nunez

{BIO 22192909 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. This question is about DANA and the consorcio. Which lines affected by
DANA were not covered by the consorcio? From the Q4 impact, do you expect to recover
anything from the consorcio?

A - Antonio Huertas Mejias

{BIO 15896108 <GO>}

Well, as I said the consorcio, which is the cat pool in Spain and is compulsory, covers wind
and flood damages from storms a certain limit. And basically, the damages that they are

Page 19 of 22

not covered, and they're converd by the private insurance business, in leaking in

What are your expectations on the life business? How could you mitigate the impact from
the flattening interest rate score?

A - Fernando Mata Verdejo

{BIO 19676348 <GO>}

Well, I don't have a crystal ball. We are doing our best effort in order to grow this business.
Life business is key for MAPFRE. It's one of the strategic lines of business, particularly in
Spain, when we have relevant Bancassurance agreement with Bankia also and Bankinter.
We focus on life protection, and we reported significant growth in both distribution
channels, I mean, the MAPFRE's agent channel and also Bancassurance.

And regarding savings, it will depends on our ability or capacity, I mean to market
attractive products usually unit linked in order to cover any particular demand from policy
holders, which is very unlikely, I mean to assess at the current moment. But we are
working pretty hard, I mean, in different products and we trying to keep the current
pipeline of new products throughout the year. But currently, it is very difficult to forecast
any particular rate of growth for life savings in Spain.
