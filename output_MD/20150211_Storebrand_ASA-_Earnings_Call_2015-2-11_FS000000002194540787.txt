Operator
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Storebrand Analyst
Conference Call. My name is Ann, and I will be your coordinator for today's conference.
For the duration of this call, you'll be on listening only. However, at the end of the
presentation, you will have opportunity to ask questions. I will now hand you over to Kjetil
Krøkje to begin today's conference. Thank you.

Kjetil Ramberg Krøkje
Welcome, everyone, to Storebrand's fourth quarter 2014 conference call. My name is Kjetil
Ramberg Krøkje, and I'm the Head of Investor Relations at Storebrand. Together with me, I
have Group CEO, Odd Arild Grefstad; CFO, Lars Løddesøl; and Head of Guaranteed
Pensions, Geir Holmgren.
In the presentation today, Odd Arild will give an overview of the development in Q4 2014
and Lars will give some more details on some of the elements in the results this quarter.
The slides will be similar to the Analyst Presentation released this morning and are
available on our Web page as well.
After the presentation, the operator will open up for questions. To be able to ask
questions, you will need to be dialed into the conference call. I now leave the word to
Storebrand's CEO, Odd Arild Grefstad, who will start the presentation on slide two.

Thank you, Kjetil, and welcome, everyone, to the presentation. The results of Storebrand
is strong, totaling NOK923 million for the quarter and NOK3.032 billion for the year. The
results are aﬀected by some special items, which Lars will comment on in more detail. The
transition of Storebrand's own pension scheme is the largest item in the positive net
NOK477 million that we characterize as special items. We have reached the cost target of
NOK400 million and will follow up the cost going forward related to a relative basis, a
cost-to-income ratio of 60% as we announced in our Capital Markets Day. The transition
from guaranteed to non-guaranteed – and insurance in the balance sheet and the result
continues.
The result from the segment savings increased with 44% compared to last year. There is
strong sales and return in the balance sheet and in the P&L, and the strong growth in
asset under management with more than 10% growth for the year.

Bloomberg Transcript

We have started up with paid-up policies with the investment choice, and I'm very happy
to report that we have transferred close to NOK900 million for the full year. The buﬀer
capital situation has strengthened signiﬁcantly in the fourth quarter by NOK10 billion. And
we have also set aside now NOK6.2 billion altogether for longevity reservation. That is half
of what is required altogether. Despite falling interest rate, we have managed to increase
the Solvency II ratio up to 148%. It means that our internal measures have canceled out the
eﬀect of the falling interest rates.
We now go to page number three. This shows Storebrand strategy, and it's still to manage
the guaranteed balance sheet with more than 130% of Solvency II margin and to continue
to grow our savings and insurance business.
Let's ﬁrst take a look at the guaranteed part of the business, that's on slide number four.
We have transferred out approximately NOK30 billion during the last two-and-a-half year.
In 2014, we moved out NOK15 billion from the guaranteed book of business. NOK11
billion was from the public sector – guaranteed public sector in Norway, NOK3 billion was
in the Swedish business and NOK1 billion, as I already have mentioned, was then the
paid-up policies converting into investment choice in the fourth quarter.
I'm also very pleased to see that NOK8 billion of our assets within the public sector have
moved into closed pension fund solutions that was sold to municipalities during 2014. The
cost program is completed with more than NOK400 million delivered. And we also see
that we have been able to take some additional measures when it comes to risk reduction
also in the fourth quarter, reduced equity exposure, and better tailoring the assets to the
liabilities of the business in a more segmented way.
Then, I – yes. That was slide number four. Then, I move to slide number ﬁve. And this is an
important picture for us. The focus in the fourth quarter has very much been to strengthen
our solvency capital position in a falling interest rate environment. The eﬀort to strengthen

FINAL

the solvency position has been a clear target above the prioritize the short-term IFRS
proﬁts.
Some of the most important measures, consolidations we have made is; one, to increase
the longevity reserve instead of leaving results to the risk equalization fund and for proﬁt
sharing. We have also signiﬁcantly strengthened the buﬀer capital that is mainly the
market value adjustment reserve, but also additional statutory reserves, and excess value
on bonds at amortized cost. Increase on these three element is more than NOK11 billion in
the third – in the fourth quarter.
And we have also done some strengthening of the technical provisions in SPP, where we
have been able to use the conditional bonuses into the technical provisions, that has also
strengthened the solvency position altogether. And this is done also altogether with a
better risk management after matching principles altogether.
So together, all these measures has contributed to the strengthening of the Solvency II
position, with approximately 20% points. This compensates the reduction in the fall in the
Solvency II position as a consequence of the decline in the interest rates.

Bloomberg Transcript

The Solvency II position, inclusive transition measures, is limited. The Solvency II position,
inclusive transition measures, is very limited impact by the changes in the interest rate
level and by the ﬁrst – all the way up to the 1st of January 2016. And it's now estimated to
148% and that is approximately 20 basis – percent point, the increase from the third
quarter.
If we then move to slide number six, we have a total reserve strengthening of NOK12.4
billion to do for longevity. The longevity reservation is strengthened by NOK2.7 billion in
2014. There's been a direct contribution on NOK121 million in the fourth quarter. That is
the NOK90 million that we used to see and, of course, the basis. And on top of that, we
have included NOK31 million that is supporting the transfer of the paid-up policies into
paid-up policies with investment choice.
There is also some indirect contribution like the foregone proﬁt sharing. And also, as I
already have mentioned, the use of the risk result directly into reservation. I'm we're
pleased to see that now, after the ﬁrst year of this program over seven year, we have been
able to reserve half of the total amount needed. We also know that we are expected to
contribute NOK2.2 billion with the results over the next six year, and after that, it's NOK4
billion left for the last six year to reserve made up of additional return on the
policyholders' funds.
If we then move to slide number seven; this is an illustration that shows the expected
return in the most challenging portfolio, the paid-up policies, going forward. Of course,
the low interest rates is challenging for a business with annual interest rates guarantees.
However, we have been able to build up an asset allocation and a proﬁt capital situation
in this portfolio that ensures good returns going forward.

FINAL

The expected return in the paid-up policies is high enough to cover for the interest rate
guarantee and also the needed buﬀer building for longevity over the next period until
2020 when this is expected to be ﬁnished.
Then after 2020, we know that the interest rate guarantee will fall down to approximately
a 3% level – down below the 3% level and expected return even with today's very low
interest rate level, going forward, should be enough to also cover for interest rate
guarantee thereafter. And also know that there is a big shift in the balance sheet from
guaranteed to non-guaranteed. So, we feel very comfortable about the capital situation
altogether even in a low interest rate level.
If we then move to slide number eight, it's to point out that the growth side of the
business are experiencing very strong growth, especially in our asset management
business and with our unit-linked reserves.

Bloomberg Transcript

And moving into slide number nine, you see that the paid-up policies with investment
choice has been a very important focus area for us in 2014. The early stages of this
process has been very promising, around 3,500 customers and NOK900 million have
been converted to paid-up policies in the fourth quarter. And so far this year, together
with the fourth quarter, we have been able to convert NOK1.5 billion and almost 5,000
customers all together.
Moving into slide number 10, we see that the growth in the unit-linked premium has been
strong in 2014 and it's expected to also be very strong in 2015, also because we
experienced a very strong sales, new customers coming into the company and increased
savings rate and income growth altogether. It's worth mentioning that this is the ﬁrst year
where we see unit-linked payments exceeds their guaranteed premiums altogether. And
this shift will, of course, continue as we see it into 2015.
So, that's so far. And I now leave the word to Lars that will give more insight into the
numbers and the results for the fourth quarter.

Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
Good afternoon, everyone. If you look at key ﬁgures on page 12, you see how the result of
NOK923 million is composed by net proﬁt sharing and loan losses by mainly discontinued
business and one-oﬀ items, which is a fairly large item of NOK477 million this quarter, and
the result before proﬁt sharing and loan losses which is the highest quality component of
the earning.
And even in a quarter where we've had a low ﬁnancial return and where we had to
strengthen our -we had a weak disability result and strengthened disability reserves, we
still have a quite strong underlying result before proﬁt sharing and loan losses.
On the lower part on the left-hand side of this picture, we see the solvency ratio over the
(0:13:25) group and the solvency capital has been built up consistently quarter-by-quarter,

Page 4 of 18



Company Name: Storebrand ASA

FINAL

and indeed by 20% or NOK10 billion through the year of 2014 according to the work and
the priorities that Odd Arild has been through.
On earnings per share, I'd like to – these are our earnings per share after tax. And I'd just
like to comment that the tax cost has been estimated to around 20% for the year 2014.
When it comes to customer buﬀers, there's been a decrease in buﬀers in Sweden –
customer buﬀers in Sweden and an increase in Norway. And the reason for the decrease
in Sweden is because we've strengthened longevity reserves for certain portfolios. And
we've been able to take the reserves strengthening from these customer buﬀers in
Sweden. The consequence is an expected higher result going forward and an improved
solvency position.
Moving over to page 13, the numbers. However, due to the one-oﬀ eﬀects or the special
items that we have brieﬂy commented upon, these numbers are diﬃcult to understand in
terms of value drivers going forward. Therefore, I would like to move you over to page 14,
where we talk a little bit more about the special item and thereby be able to see the value
drivers in the underlying proﬁtability afterwards.

Bloomberg Transcript

So, basically, the special items can be contributed to three diﬀerent things. The ﬁrst and
most important thing is that we have closely deﬁned beneﬁt plan for Storebrand in
Norway. The consequence is the positive eﬀect in the accounting of NOK571 million,
which is accounted for as a lower-operational cost.
It is a one-oﬀ item in the quarter. However, with the change from deﬁned beneﬁt to
deﬁned contribution scheme, we will see less volatility and, over time, lower-operating
cost in the company. So, this is part of the cost reduction and cost control program.
The second item I would like to point out is that in Sweden, we've done a review of the
reserves in diﬀerent parts of the portfolio and versus dissolved ATP compensation. That is
a historic coverage that is no longer needed and that is no longer given to Swedish
employees. And we've been able to dissolve the reserve related to ATP compensation. As
I said, it's no longer an insurance that we give.
On the other hand, we have strengthened longevity reserves and also reserves for future
costs related to tax that is accounted for here under what's called special items ﬁnancial
results SPP. What we've done is that we've strengthened the reserves by a total of NOK1.3
billion, and then we've taken NOK1 billion out of the conditional bonuses of the client,
which we saw on the previous page, and NOK300 million or NOK322 million of
shareholders' contribution in order to strengthen these reserves, and that comes in termsit comes as a negative ﬁnancial result.
So, for the Swedish business as a whole, the plus NOK322 million and the minus NOK322
cancel each other out. It's actually coincidental that these numbers are exactly the same,
but the eﬀect is therefore neutral for the Swedish business, but it comes on through
diﬀerent proﬁtability lines.

FINAL

The third and last special item that I would like to comment is what Odd Arild has already
commented upon, that previously we've been able to build part of the result in the
guaranteed business to a Risk Equalization Fund, which is 50% of a surplus. On the other
hand, 50% has been given to policyholders.
Through a letter from the FSA received in October is that we should not bid the risk
equalization fund as long as we're under reserved for long life. And, therefore, the NOK98
billion is given back to customers, as well as NOK98 million contributed into the risk
equalization fund is now being – is being put into longevity reserve strengthening, and
will continue to be done so for the next years. So, this will reduce income from the risk
result in this period.
So, all in all, these items account for NOK477 million. And if we deduct them from the
result lines and the Storebrand's overall results overview on page 15, we see that the fee
and administration income is up 0.4% year-on-year. It's actually if you deduct the
corporate bank and the public sector of 5%, so when you take out the discontinued
business. The risk result life and pension has stronger than last year due to the fact that
we now have longevity tables, and despite the fact that we have taken out the risk
adjustment – the risk equalization fund that I mentioned.

Bloomberg Transcript

Insurance payments and claims account for putting in (18:59) together, insurance results.
And we can see that there's been higher claims in the fourth quarter because it's cold and
slippery in Norway, and also, the disability results are weaker, and we'll continue to build
disability buﬀers which we started in the third quarter. We now feel that the buﬀers are
adequate and are – that are ﬁnishing this part of the disability reserves strengthening.
On operational cost, they are down for the full year. It's up in the fourth quarter compared
to the fourth quarter 2013, and that is a result of more market spending and more market
activity connected with all the stakes that we've achieved in the fourth quarter.
The ﬁnancial result is strong for the full year, somewhat weaker in the fourth quarter giving
a result before proﬁt sharing and loan losses of NOK541 million for the quarter. The net
proﬁt sharing and loan losses, that's primarily proﬁt sharing for Swedish business, which is
again strong for the full year. That is weaker than the market has reason to expect in the
fourth quarter due to the sensitivities that we've given in the supplementary information.
The reason why it's weaker than we can expect on the sensitivities is due to the very
signiﬁcant fall in interest rates and the turbulence in the ﬁnancial market in the fourth
quarter, where our sensitivities has not been given – has not been giving a full picture on
when that movement are as big as they were.
Provisions for longevity, you are used to see NOK90 million per quarter on this line. As
Lars said a moment ago, the charge is NOK31 million higher now due to the fact that we
have transferred NOK900 million into paid-up policies with investment choice. And some
of these paid-up policies have been under reserved for long life, and we have on average
contributed about 3% of the reserves to strengthen longevity before the transfer. That
gives us a result before amortization and write-downs, excluding non-recurring items, of
Page 6 of 18

Date: 2015-02-11

NOK445 million, and you add on the special items and you end up with NOK923 million
for the quarter.

FINAL

So, that's just a brief overview of the result. And you will ﬁnd, on the following pages,
more breakdown into diﬀerent (0:21:26) and value and business sectors, but I won't go
through that in detail now. We'll be happy to take any questions.

Kjetil Ramberg Krøkje
Operator, we'll now open up for questions.

Please go ahead, your line is now open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi. Good morning. I just have three questions on – all on solvency, actually. You
mentioned earlier about three or so key measures that you've taken over the course of the
quarter to oﬀset the 20 percentage point drag from lower rates. Could you just give us a
feel for sort of the – roughly how much each measure contributed?
And then secondly, can you just comment on the sort of ongoing P&L impact that we
should expect as a result of these measures that you've taken, so looking into next year?
And then lastly, I guess, on the sensitivities, the updated sensitivities, the growth impact
from a further 50 basis point decline in interest rates is, I guess, broadly unchanged. But
just wondering how we should think about the net impact going forward, i.e., are there
any other oﬀsetting measures or internal measures that you can take to reduce this gross
20 percentage point impact for every 50 basis points? Thank you.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Thank you. Try to comment on this and also, of course, we'll use some of the rounding
here (0:23:13). Starting with the solvency numbers; I think it's quite evenly on these four
diﬀerent elements that I have spread out, that's up to around 20%. We have been able to
strengthen longevity above the level we were supposed to do during the year. And I'll say
there's the full eﬀect of that, but that was somewhat underestimated when we came out
with our numbers in the third quarter. So it's more a full eﬀect of the total NOK2.7 billion
build-up compared to the NOK1.8 billion that should be built up during this year. So, that
is an important part of it. That is, more or less, one part of it.
Then it's also the case that we have been building other buﬀers, like in special the market
value adjustment reserves. That is a very strong increase in the fourth quarter. And we
have been very focused on measuring that. We have realized some losses also to make

Page 7 of 18



Company Name: Storebrand ASA
Company Ticker: STB NO Equity
Date: 2015-02-11

sure that we have build-up the market value adjustment reserve, and that together also is
a very good impact on the solvency position and gives 3% to 4% points altogether.

FINAL

And then, it's clear that the issues that we have done in Sweden, where we have
introduced conditional bonuses that has not been very eﬀective for solvency purposes,
been able to transform that into technical reserves on the insurance side is also a very
strong eﬀect on the solvency sale (0:24:51) ratio.
And then, altogether, all the small items with segmentation, making sure that we have the
right risk matching of asset/liabilities in the diﬀerent portfolios, altogether it's also some
reductions of equity portions, because when we are more tailor-made, we can use – we
have use of the excess return that we can take out the expected from the equity market.
So, that, altogether, is also a very important element in it. It's also, of course, we were
working to the model altogether. So, it's somewhat changing the model in itself, but this
is the main element. It's actually things that is done with the business and it adds up to a
20% point increase.

Bloomberg Transcript

Going forward, on the P&L eﬀect, I would say it's – what brings into my mind is two
element that goes the diﬀerent ways. As we have said, we use to take a part of the risk
result over the P&L. It's more like an hybrid type of equity because it's equity that we build
up in this place. And there is a reserve that is not common multiple to use for everything.
It can only be used for negative risk results. So, in that way, it's something between equity
and debt actually.
But anyway, it's been under IFRS, to taken over in the result, NOK98 million this year. It will
be lower numbers going forward. But this is an element that we not – will expect to see for
the next couple of years through the P&L.
On the other hand, the strengthening of the reserves in Sweden should bring into a
situation where we have stronger risk result in Sweden going forward that goes in the
opposite direction. I don't know if Lars or anyone has other elements from this that they'd
like to draw – bring forward?

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
Yes. No, we will continue to build this underlying solvency through continued building up
of capital and results and the whole (0:27:10) part of the results back in the life business.
And the transition to non-guaranteed products continues and the growth in non – sorry,
the growth in non-guaranteed products increase. And the guaranteed products are slowly
maturing in terms of shortening the duration and lowering the guarantees.
So, there are a number of things that over time will decrease the capital charge related to
the guaranteed products and the capital build-up from the non-guaranteed products. So,
these are some of the measures that – and we will look at other things as well in terms of
fully coordinating our models with the ﬁnal Solvency II requirements, et cetera.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

FINAL

I'll also say that when we do our planning or forecast on solvency ratios, of course, we
expect to have increase (0:28:01) in the underlying solvency ratio during 2015. There's a
lot of measures that is under performance to come into the balance sheet results. And as
we have shown in the fourth quarter, we are also working with this to be completed and
give eﬀect in ﬁrst quarter or second quarter and the rest of the 2015.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
And in terms of sensitivities, you can see on slide number ﬁve that when we managed to
keep the underlying solvency without transition rules stable from Q3 to Q4, the eﬀect of
the transition rules increased from approximately 24 percentage points to approximately
47 percentage points. That is a consequence of the diﬀerent capital position in the
Solvency I and Solvency II and the traditional – sorry, the transitional rules take one minus
the other and add it on to the capital and then you write it oﬀ over the next 16 years. And
so, this is the way the transitional rules work.
So, if the interest rate that will fall or one of the other sensitivities happen in the ﬁrst
quarter, and you may see that you have an underlying movement, which is impacted
pretty much according to the sensitivities shown here, while the eﬀect with transitional
rules up until January 1, 2016 will be rather stable. So – but after 2016, then these
sensitivities will be registered also for the headline number.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Daniel A. Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Okay. But just a follow up, I guess I was just wondering, if over the course of the quarter
we see another 50 basis point decline in interest rates, I understand that the ratio with
transitional rules would remain broadly unchanged, but the line (0:30:08) would come
down by roughly that sensitivity, so 20 percentage points?

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Everything equal, it will come down with that sensitivity. But as we have shown this
quarter, of course, we will perform a lot of measures also going forward that will – where
we will try to mitigate such movement in the interest rates.

Q - Daniel A. Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Okay. Understood. All right. Thank you very much.

The next question comes from Matti Ahokas from the Danske Bank. Please go ahead. your
line is now open.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Yes. Good afternoon. Three questions, if I may? Firstly, just technically, the paid-up
policies with investment choice, they're now booked, I guess, under unit-linked Norway, is
that correct? And then, there was an NOK4.2 billion increase in unit-linked Sweden on the

Page 9 of 18



Company Name: Storebrand ASA
Company Ticker: STB NO Equity
Date: 2015-02-11

reserves, on other, and it's a fairly sizeable ﬁgure quarter-on-quarter. I was wondering if
you could explain that a bit.

FINAL

And the third question is regarding page seven. It's a very interesting chart you are
presenting here. Could you talk a bit about the assumptions that you are using this – in
this expected return? And for example, what are the current reinvestment yields that
you're able to generate in Guaranteed Pension Norway? Thanks.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
The ﬁrst question on paid-policies with investment choice, yes, they are a part of unitlinked Norway. And the second was Sweden. I guess you have both an eﬀect from
currency in the quarter. That, as Lars said earlier, was pretty neutral during the year, but it
increased quite a lot in the quarter and we use end-of-quarter numbers on the balance
sheet. So, a part of that (0:31:56).
And when it comes to returns and what we can reinvest to, I guess, the Norwegian swap
rates now are at 1.7-ish (32:13). And over that we have diﬀerent normalized risk premiums
depending on diﬀerent asset classes. More or less that (0:32:22) we are selective on
where we invest now, given the current interest rate environment and our need for
reinvestment.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

It's also our portfolio that is declining, not increasing, so that is also an element,
altogether with the total guarantees book of business. When it comes to the assumption,
when it comes to return to build up this 4.2%, 4.1% return, it's very much based on heldto-maturity bond portfolio. That's typically 50% to 60% we assume out of this portfolio.
Then, we have the real estate portfolio in Norway having a direct yield of around 4.8%,
4.9% that is added here, and that's also a substantial part of it. And then it's bonds at
mark-to-market with actually a market value you have under that. And then, it's – it's very
much – when you look at the paid-up policies, it's very low allocation to that. I will expect
extra 5%, 6% to the point when it comes to these paid-up policies. So, of course, that is
the element that might have some changes in the values here, it's a normalized
expectation. But for 94%, 95% of the total portfolio is very much quite robust and quite
secure return that we have added on as expected return going forward.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
And it's based on current interest rates also going forward.

A - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Yes.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

So, Matti, basically looking at the actual yield in the diﬀerent portfolios and the bonds that
amortized closely is stable. And stable portfolio is a duration of some six-and-a-half years.

Page 10 of 18

So – and then whatever come out of that and maturities reinvested at today's interest rate
level.

FINAL

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

So, basically, the portfolio, currently, I remember, was it 4.8% was the – was the held-tomaturity portfolio running yield, and this is basically based on the redemption of that
portfolio?

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Yes. Because it's based on the chart; based on both the redemption on that portfolio, it is
also – it's also based on the issuance of new paid-up policies, which we reinvest at the
current yield curve.

Q - Matti Ahokas

{BIO 2037723 <GO>}

Great. Thanks a lot.

Q - David T. Andrich

{BIO 15414075 <GO>}

Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my questions. I was just wondering, in terms of
the internal measures you implemented to help keep Solvency II stable on a look-through
basis, so without the transition rules quarter-over-quarter, I was just wondering how far
can you kind of shift the needle going forward? Say like on a scale from one to 10, how
high can you turn up the volume on that? Are you kind of already at a nine then in terms
of what you've achieved, or do you feel there's a lot more that you can achieve there?
And then second of all, I was wondering, in terms of the higher incidence of disability in
the quarter, is that coming through mainly kind of on the DC side, or on the DB side, or

We have a toolbox of available tools to strength Solvency II. And there is – there are
uncertainties still related to the ﬁnal outcome of how the rules will ﬁnally be set. And the
eﬀect of – or how many tools to use in the toolbox depends on the interest rate level and
on the ﬁnalization of the rules. Obviously, we've done a lot of the easy stuﬀ so far, but
there are still things we are working on. And I don't want to go into detail about that.
But Solvency II is quite a sophisticated and complicated set of rules. And as we go
through our economic models and adapt it to Solvency II, we do see ways to improve
product proﬁtability in diﬀerent scenarios as set under Solvency II. And we see ways that
we can introduce management actions and pricing features that are meaningful under
Solvency II regime.

So, the purpose of Solvency II is to improve risk management and long-term proﬁtability
in the insurance business, and we see that Solvency II has helped us to become even
better on this. And we will continue to strive to be excellent.
With respect to higher disability, we see higher disability, ﬁrst and foremost, in the – both
Swedish and Norwegian unit-linked portfolios. And it's not like it's a huge diﬀerence, but
margins in this business are thin. So therefore, when you see an increase in disability, and,
at the same time, we're strengthening some reserves, it does impact the quarterly results.

Bloomberg Transcript

Thanks. Thanks very much. Good afternoon. I've got a couple of questions left. A lot of
them have been asked. Firstly, on the transfers paid up with investment choice, I was
wondering what impact did that have on your economic capital numbers given that you
did almost NOK1 billion. It wasn't something you talked about having an impact. But I
wonder if it did move the needle.
Related to that, given you're targeting NOK5 billion for this year, would you – or to get to
NOK5 billion for this year, would you expect that to increase further the cost of the
longevity provisioning? And again, related to that, are you still conﬁdent in your initial
expectations as to how much of that book can actually be moved ultimately?
And then, I think I had one further question. Just on – again, just coming back to the new
money rates, what you're investing money in today. You talked about the swap rate being
at 1.7 plus a normal risk premium. I guess plus some real estate, et cetera, are you able to
get the new money yield up above 2.5% to possibly 3% at the moment, or is that too high
in this market? Thank you.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Okay. Let's start with the transfers. And yes, we have the target of NOK5 billion as we see
it now. Around 3% of the assets that's been moved we need to top up with the long life
resource. So that gives you the number, you saw NOK30 million and around NOK1 billion
now in the fourth quarter. And we expect that ratio to be the same also going forward for
the assets that we moved from and hopefully into paid-up policies within the investment
choice.
And yes, we have our segmentation model and we still have the same target. We expect,
of course, this also to continue oﬀ to 2015. We have put the target up for 2015. We also

see that it's important for us to be in good contact with the companies and the employees
in the company when they do change this from deﬁned beneﬁt to the incentivized
contribution, then everyone will have a new pension scheme like we do in Storebrand
ourself these days.
And that's a very good situation to do works at marketing to really make sure that we give
the total message to all the employees in the company. And if this moves then the needle
when it comes to Solvency II, well, one thing it will happen in the ﬁrst quarter and the
NOK1 billion in itself doesn't, of course, oﬀset anything much. But going forward,
expectation of being able to move this and also for the new paid-up policies that comes
in, in a conversion from deﬁned beneﬁt into deﬁned – into unit linked result. That gives of
course a very important toolbox to also make sure that we have a good situation
Solvency-wise out of the new paid-up policies. I don't know if anyone like to...

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
Yes. I think we – on – on Capital Markets Day, we said that the old paid-up policies had up
to 20% capital charge. So, if you have NOK1 billion time 20% capital charge and you
transfer that into a new product, that has a negative capital charge or it contributes capital
in a large company, then you can look at some of the capital consequences by using
those numbers.

Bloomberg Transcript

And in terms of reinvestment hurdles (0:42:04), I can conﬁrm that between 2.5% and 3%
is a reasonable reinvestment level at this stage.

Q - Blair T. Stewart

{BIO 4191309 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. Just coming back on the paid-up book, would you still expect the net –
net-net for the book to continue to increase over the next coming years? Because whilst
you're transferring out, of course, there's further transfers in from the closure of active DB
schemes. How do you see that book evolving in size over the next two to three years?

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
Yes, Blair. As we showed on the illustration on the Capital Markets Day we expect this to
increase over the next years and go up to somewhere around NOK110 billion. But then
there is a big uncertainty here relating to when transfers happened for deﬁned beneﬁt
and also how fast people move in to paid-up policies with investment choice. So, it could
be bigger and it could be smaller but I think that is the best guess for the three to ﬁveyear period. I don't know if any of you...

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

I also want to say that, that (0:43:22) taking into account (0:43:26) numbers. So, that is
what we have put into our models. If we are to succeed with even a higher person into
paid-up policies with investment choice or keep the assets longer in DB schemes that will
be an upside on that calculation.

The next question comes from Paris Hadjiantonis from KBW. Please go ahead. Your line is
now open.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Paris Hadjiantonis

{BIO 19703051 <GO>}

Yes. Hello and thank you very much for taking my questions today. I just have two. The
ﬁrst one is from this indirect charge where you used the risk result now rather than the
equalization fund, and you have NOK98 million for this year. Is this a good number where
we can do our forecast for the next few years or does it largely depend on what happens
with the foregone charge – the charge from the foregone proﬁt sharing which was
NOK230 million this year?
And the second question is on the solvency. Basically, if you could give us a kind of an
idea of the measures we have taken, whether these have impacted the required capital
side or the available capital side. Thank you very much.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Okay. I can start with the ﬁrst question about the risk equalization fund. For 2014, we spent
NOK98 million (45:24) that in – we used as – which is the longevity reserves. And we
expect that number to decrease going on. What you also can say is that when the contract
on DB and paid-up policies are truly reserves regarding longevity, we don't need to use
the risk equalization fund to the longevity reserves, and we have to look at that contract or
contracts which means that going on the next years when more contracts are fully
reserved, we will increase the risk result, decrease the amount spend to the longevity
reserves, which should in – otherwise would have been (0:46:22). So, when we look at the
number, NOK98 million for 2014, it will slowly go decrease during the next years.
I can also add that we have already some contracts that are fully reserved. And for these
contracts, we are actually, also in 2014, put in a position where we, in some way built a
little bit into the risk equalization fund. So, it's fair to say that this number will go down in a
slow pace during the next year.

And with respect to the risk capital or the solvency question you had, it's both this
available capital and it reduces required capital. So, it's a balanced answer to that
question. I don't want to go into a lot of detail on that. It becomes extremely complicated
to do on a phone call.

line is now open.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. So, good afternoon from me, as well. I have a couple of questions, I guess, on the
same tune that we have been discussing until now. Just perhaps a little bit more precise.
This sensitivity you're showing, 50 bps down, it's around 20% on the solvency margin.
Basically, the internal measures you have taken in this quarter have improved the solvency
margin by around NOK5 billion. Would it be – how should we look at it? If rates go down
50 bps, do you have another NOK5 billion on internal measures that would put the
solvency margin excluding transitional rules around 101%, or even a bit better, considering
return earnings? Or, well, actually, you don't have another NOK5 billion to ﬁnd like this.
How we should really think about it.
And even more importantly, back to the dividend situation here, I think in past discussion
the assumption that you should have had a solvency margin excluding transitional rule
above 100% with some buﬀer to sort of make the FSA happy before paying dividend was
the right assumption. In conversation that I had today, I don't know any more what is the
right assumption. Can you spend some more in trying to tell us how do you see this point,
which, I guess, is quite important? Thanks a lot.

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Okay. Well, I think we have answered already on how we are building buﬀer capital. We
are focusing on doing that every day, and that has been the main focus throughout fourth
quarter. And have put emphasis on that rather than building short-term IFRS result. We
will continue to do that. I think both me and Lars has given you some examples of what
are working with, and we are very dedicated of doing that also going forward, even if the
interest rates falls or rises as such. Okay, so...

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

That's not easy (0:49:32).

Yes. It's not easy to ﬁnd NOK5 billion every quarter. I agree on that. But this quarter, we
have been really also positive when it comes to the ﬁnancial markets. They've been able
to build buﬀers above the levels that should be expected in normal situation both in
market value adjustment reserves and also when it comes to longevity reservation. And
we have also been able to do some reclassiﬁcation of the properties in Sweden.
This is some example of what we are doing. And as Lars said, we have a toolbox done.
We have used a lot of the tools, of course, the easy way out, as they are still working for
this on a daily basis, and I am conﬁdent that we'll also ﬁnd build and solutions and good
measures that we'll keep strengthening the Solvency II position going forward.

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
And if I may add, the way – the question forward, it seems to indicate that we ﬁrst
neutralize whatever comes. Obviously, we can't do that. We are working very – in a very
high quality way to improve our length, to improve the product and improve the solvency
position. It so happened that that neutralized pretty much 100%, the – all of interest rates
in the fourth quarter. But it's quite obvious that we will be able to ﬁnd either we're less
than whatever comes from the interest rate sensitivity in the quarters ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

When it comes to dividend discussions, we have basically a target forward saying that we
should be at par. We're 130% in the regulatory solvency position. That is the target we are
watching when it comes to solvency. And of course, the movement in the fourth quarter in
itself is very positive moving towards our dividend position.
Then, of course, it will be a powerful view from the board when that is the time for looking
at that. And that will be forward-looking. It will be based on buﬀer capital situation,
interest rates and everything. But the number that will measure us around is the headline
solvency ratio of 148, as we speak.

Q - Gianandrea Roberti

{BIO 6786731 <GO>}

Just one follow up on this, what happens if your solvency ratio excluding transitional rules
fall to 90%, as an example, at the end of 2015, just to make the hypothesis here, right?
How do you see that situation where one ratio it's well above what you are targeting and
the other one is at 90%? How do we need to think about this?

A - Odd Arild Grefstad

{BIO 5483351 <GO>}

Well, of course, a regulatory number is the headline number. That is what is put forward
and that is what is needed and, henceforward, make sure that we have the right transition,
16 years period into Solvency II. And that is what is really the regulatory framework that we
are measured against. Then again, of course, we also need to look forward how will, on a
yearly basis, that headline solvency ratio evolve and we both will be in a situation where
we are able to keep up the solvency ratio going forward.
So we have to take a total view of the company, of the results of the balance sheet in such
a situation. But it's hard to just answer that question based on a point number of the
headline solvency number and the underlying solvency number.

The last question for today comes from Daniel Do-Thoi from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
Your line is now open.

Q - Daniel A. Do-Thoi

{BIO 17019775 <GO>}

Hi. Daniel Do-Thoi. Just a couple of follow-up questions. The ﬁrst one was on – I want to
ask about the operating cost this quarter, which I guess on an underlying basis was quite
a bit ahead of what you had been reporting in terms of a run rate year-to-date. Also, in the
context of – or at least my expectation that a lot of the cost savings that you were – that
were scheduled for this year were very much back-end loaded. That was the ﬁrst question.
The second one is on the Moody's credit rating downgrade. I just wondered if that had
any impact in terms of your day-to-day operations, whether that's trying to win new
business or whether – or growing in diﬀerent parts of the business. And then I guess
related to that, and the previous question on the dividend, how do you think about that
when it comes to the year end, i.e., if you are ahead of your 130% with a good outlook,
but you are still below your target A rating, how do you take that into account then? Thank
you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Lars Aasulv Løddesøl
With respect to the operating cost, as I mentioned, we've had a very, very high market
activity in the fourth quarter, which has resulted in signiﬁcant improvements in sales and
also sales bonuses to the sales force. So, that explains most of the increase in operating
cost in the fourth quarter. And as we have mentioned or as we have pointed out to you on
the Capital Markets Day, we will continue to follow the cost level of group very closely, but
we are allowing ourselves to look at this on the cost-to-income ratio as the result of the
consequence that we see a lot of investment opportunities in new sector and new
customers. And we need to be able to meet those customers in a prudent way. So, we will
continue the cost focus. You do not expect cost to go signiﬁcantly up, but we will measure
this on a cost-to-income basis going forward in order to allow for proﬁtable growth.
In terms of the Moody's downgrade, we have not seen that that has impacted sales or our
daily operation in anyway. We've been on negative outlook for a long period of time, and
as Moody's write in their report, basically, Storebrand and management of Storebrand
does right things in a challenging microeconomic environment. They are concerned
about low-interest rates, and that's certainly something that we are working on every day
to deal with as well.
And on dividends, I don't know if you want to add anything more than what we've already
said about it.

I think we're already been into that discussion. The number we are following very closely
is the headline Solvency II number, and are very pleased to see that – this develop our
130% (0:56:11), that is a very good starting point for being able to take up dividends again.
Credit rating, we have our ﬁnancial targets. So, a A target is absolutely a part of our
targets. But that is also to be in a dividend position to pay dividends. So, I'm not sure that
I can add anymore to that discussion at this point of time.
