MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, good morning. Welcome to the Half Year Results 2017 Analyst
Conference Call. I'm Elona, the Chorus Call operator. I would like to remind you that all
participants will be in listen-only mode and the conference is being recorded. After the
presentation, there will be a Q&A session. The conference must not be recorded for
publication or broadcast.
At this time, it's my pleasure to hand over to Marc Kaiser, Head of Corporate
Communications & Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.

Marc Kaiser

{BIO 15056036 <GO>}

Thank you and good morning, everybody, to this analyst call for the half year results 2017
and follow-up. It's a pleasure to have you all online. On this occasion, I would also like to
draw your attention to a new product we have in our webpage called C-Level Insights,
which gives you a little bit broad context of the story behind the success of Bâloise on the
topics we are currently working on and the themes will likely also take oﬀ in the following
road shows.
I would now like to hand over to Gert with a short summary and then we head into Q&A.

FINAL

Thank you, Marc. A very warm welcome to all of you from my side. Together with me is
Marc Kaiser, as he made the introduction, but also Matthias Henny, our Chief Investment
Oﬃcer; and Carsten Stolz, our Chief Financial Oﬃcer.
I am very pleased and very satisﬁed with the half year results, mainly for two reasons. One,
we've proven again that the core of our business is reliable and produces strong results
over and over again. And secondly because our new Simply Safe strategy is taking more
and more concrete forms, we've seen a number of examples and innovation projects over
the last couple of months, and I will come back to that in the end of this short summary.
In terms of results, I wanted to highlight on one side growth, the non-life and the life
technical results and our capital strengths. And then, as already said, in the end, I would
like to name a couple of examples of where our new strategy is taking us in terms of
alternative business models and innovation.

Bloomberg Transcript

In terms of growth, we are growing exactly where we want in our target segments. In local
currency, close to 2% in non-life, so the P&C business. And in everything, which is
investment terms business unit-linked business, we're growing over 4%. So, we are
growing where we want to grow.
In terms of technical results in non-life and life, you've seen the combined ratio of 89.7%,
that is almost 3% lower than 2016. So, technically, operationally, a very strong P&C book.
One of the bests in Europe. But also our life business has delivered a very strong result
with an EBIT of CHF 150 million linked to three things: one, lower reserving as last year;
two, a very solid interest margin; and three, a much better business mix, with less
guarantees or guarantees limit in time, which also led to a higher new business margin of
close to 25%.
In terms of capitalization and capital strength, Standard & Poor's has reconﬁrmed our A
rating with stable outlook and a AAA rating in terms of capitalization. Belgium has got
also a speciﬁc A rating and Germany an A-minus rating with stable outlook. And if you
look at our Swiss Solvency position, we are, in all scenarios, in the green, even in a stress
scenario with a 100 basis points lower interest rate and a stock market crash of 50%, we
would still be in the green. So, from an operational point of view, core of our business
performing very solid and very strong.
And the new strategy Simply Safe where we focus relentlessly on customers on
simplifying products and processes, and on additional solutions and services for our
customers, we've improved throughout the whole group over the last couple of months
of a lot new initiatives, new innovation projects. To name a few, our Mobile Insurer FRIDAY
in Berlin, the acquisition of MOVU, the digital moving platform in Switzerland, the ﬁrst
private cyber-insurance in Switzerland, the watch insurance with photo recognition, which
makes a lot of possibilities open.

And then other ﬁelds, of course, could drive our ﬁrst telematics product in Luxembourg,
Monviso which is a robot asset management advisor in Germany, and SafeHome (04:52)
which is in ﬁrst Internet-of-Things property insurance in Belgium. You see that our strategy
is starting to work, so we're not only conﬁdent in the near future, but also very conﬁdent
in the long-term future given our success of the new strategy.

FINAL

I would leave it to that and actually would be glad to open up for questions.

Q&A
Operator
We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The ﬁrst question is from Guilhem
Horvath from Exane. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Guilhem Horvath

{BIO 18460437 <GO>}

Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, I'll start with two. The ﬁrst one is
on loss ratio, and I'd like you to maybe explain the rather

Bloomberg Transcript

important deterioration in Switzerland loss ratio, because I guess in the press release, you
explained the Luxembourg one, but I didn't ﬁnd anything on Switzerland?
And on loss ratio still, can you discuss a little bit the runoﬀ proﬁts, because it's, I think, the
second year in a row excluding the reduction ceiling (06:17) in Germany last year that you
are well above what you described as a normal level in terms of run-oﬀ proﬁts. And I'd like
to understand where is this going and what we should expect for the future, and also if
you released something in Germany this half year?
And the second question is on the life EBIT, because you still, I think, have a guidance of
CHF 200 million, and you printed something like CHF 115 million in H1, which is well
above what you did in the last couple of years and it looks well ahead of the full-year
guidance. So, maybe if you can elaborate on this full-year guidance and explain where we
should expect the balance to be at year-end and if this guidance is still in force or not?
Thank you.

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Let me pick up the ﬁrst wave of answers, and I'm sure that the colleagues will add to that if
required. In terms of loss ratio in Switzerland and the run-oﬀ proﬁts, I think we need to be
careful, we're talking here about the half-year results, which means that we don't steer to
the half-year results, so there are seasonalities in there and we should be careful.
I think if you compare Switzerland to last year's – 2016 ﬁrst half year was a very, very
exceptional year with a lot of reserves wins and a very, very benign claims year. So, I think
if you compare it to half-year 2015, which was around, combined ratio in Switzerland,
about 85%, we're clearly below the 2015. So, 2016 ﬁrst year half was very exceptional. So,

Page 3 of 17



Company Name: Baloise Holding AG

Date: 2017-08-30

FINAL

we need to be a bit careful there. Runoﬀ proﬁts are indeed high (07:57) again, it's half
year, it's volatile. We don't steer to that. So, we expect a 2% to 3% actually prior year loss
development to be the normal thing.
So, coming to your Germany question, there have been no reserve releases in Germany
to achieve the 99.5% combined ratio. So, the reserving we did last year are still intact. In
terms of life EBIT, the CHF 200 million guidance is indeed our guidance. And we are
conﬁdent that we'll actually get to that point at the end of the year. But additional details,
Carsten or Matthias.

A - Carsten Stolz

{BIO 6055047 <GO>}

Maybe just heading to what has been said on the life side, obviously, it all depends on the
further development of the interest rate environment. The half-year results you've seen in
the slides shows substantially lower interest rate eﬀect than the ﬁrst half 2016. So, a lot will
depend on where interest rates will go until year-end. Maybe that's just as an additional
remark to what Gert just said.

Q - Guilhem Horvath

{BIO 18460437 <GO>}

Okay. Thanks.

Operator

Bloomberg Transcript

The next question is from Daniel Bischof from Baader-Helvea. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Daniel Bischof

{BIO 17407166 <GO>}

Yeah. Good morning, everyone. A couple of questions, the ﬁrst one is on Germany. I
mean the overall proﬁtability improved, combined ratio are below 100%. If you look at the
expense ratio in isolation 38%, I mean that's more than 10 points above the market
average. How do you look at this?
The second one is on the cash remittance. So, your (09:46) target here is around CHF 400
million per annum. I guess after the ﬁrst half, you should have a pretty good idea
where you land this year. I mean, some thoughts about this would be helpful.
And then, the last one is on FRIDAY. Could you talk a bit more about the developments
there? And (10:05) mentioned that the progress so far is encouraging. But I'd be
interested to know how the market responded, how many clients you've won so far,
whether the business is performing as expected, just some additional comments here
would be helpful. Thank you.

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Thank you, Mr. Bischof. Germany, I think what is clear in Germany is that we're actually
delivering against what we said and we promised and we planned, which is the shift in the
portfolio in non-life, which is on its way. That means away from the volatile industry
Page 4 of 17



Company Name: Baloise Holding AG

Date: 2017-08-30

FINAL

business, so we have actually 13% less premium this half year than last half year, but we
are growing where we want to grow in retail and SME, in retail with 6% compared to last
year, in SME with 5% compared to last year; overall, plus 3%.
So, we're moving away from the volatile industry business, and we're investing heavily in
the private and in the SME business. And that's also the main reason why the cost ratio
has gone up. We're actually investing in additional contacts with brokers. We're investing
in the segments in non-life which are the most proﬁtable, but that also means that we pay
slightly higher commissions, which is actually the reason why cost ratio has gone up.
I'll leave the cash question to Carsten. Maybe a few words on FRIDAY. FRIDAY has actually
been launched in an early bird stage in March-April this year. The objective was to actually
have a number of tens to hundreds of clients in which we were testing the processes and
the product, and actually continuously seeing where to adapt. So the real go-live (11:53) of
FRIDAY will be in this autumn when the renewal season for car insurance in Germany will
start. With what we see, although we are still in an early bird and in a pilot phase, is that
we are growing the number of clients per week that we're actually acquiring is growing
steadily.

Bloomberg Transcript

We will launch the pay per kilometers insurance which is a very strong innovation in the
German market. We have insurance for additional drivers. So, it's not only from a digital
point of view, a very strong innovation also from a product and a process point of view,
and making it very simply for our customers, FRIDAY is an example. Over to Carsten on
the cash question.

A - Carsten Stolz

{BIO 6055047 <GO>}

Thank you for the question. With regard to cash remittance half year, we have had a good
start into the half year as Gert said. Yet, I would like to remain cautious and would like to
look at this question based on the full year results. We have seen many, many years ago
that even end of December, tremendous winter storms can hit. So, I would like to have a
look at the full year situation ﬁrst, before answering this question fully. But certainly, we
had a good start into the year and, therefore, we'll hope that we can continue this way this
year.

Q - Daniel Bischof

{BIO 17407166 <GO>}

All right. Thank you very much.

Operator
The next question is from Peter Elliot from Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Perhaps if I could ask one on the life margin, ﬁrst of all, and that was
very strong. You attributed part of the improvement to model reﬁnements. I was
wondering if you could just explain what those reﬁnements were? Second thing was on
the share buyback. Well, I guess, (13:58) have been below the required run rate. I was
Page 5 of 17



Company Name: Baloise Holding AG
Company Ticker: BALN SW Equity
Date: 2017-08-30

wondering if you could just elaborate on what drove the timing of those and what will
drive the timing of those? And then ﬁnal question on the upcoming referendum on
pension reform, I was wondering if you just give us your thoughts on what's (14:18)
outcome might mean for you? Thank you very much.

FINAL

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Let me go ﬁrst on a number of points, I'll leave share buyback to Carsten and also
additional details on life also for Carsten. I think if you look at the life result and the new
business margin, if you look – there are actually three main reasons why we achieved this
strong life results.

Bloomberg Transcript

One is we are clearly moving into a better business mix away from guarantees and limited
guarantees in time. That's one. Given the interest rate environment, we have made less
reservations in the life book, although we voluntarily reserved also this year about
approximately CHF 70 million and totally our interest rate margin is – the diﬀerence
between the guarantees, we actually deliver. And the asset management returns are 115
basis points, so a very strong result. If you look at the model changes last year in the life
business in Switzerland, they would account approximately for I would say 50% of the
improvement. And all the operational things I just mentioned account for the other 50%.
In terms of the pension reform, so the third question, we support fully actually the opinion
of the Swiss Insurance – I don't know how you said it – Association indeed. Thank you. This
means that we have a very neutral position. There are a number of elements in the
proposed reform which are positive. There are a number of elements in the proposed
reform, which for a life insurer or a group life insurer are not that positive. So, we actually
follow the opinion of (16:07) also the Swiss Insurance Association. Carsten, maybe on
additional details or the share buyback?

A - Carsten Stolz

{BIO 6055047 <GO>}

Yeah. On the share buyback, as you've seen, we have started the buyback and up to now
we have bought back 8% of the up to 3 million shares. The buyback is executed in the
context of the stock price market development aiming at buying back the shares below
the volume-weighted average price over the whole time horizon where we buy back.
And, in that context, we adjust our buying back behavior depending on where the share
price goes up or down. That's the pattern which we've largely followed. We follow this
pretty closely, me and also Matthias Henny from the Asset Management Department, and
therefore, the share buyback is going to continue.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Thank you very much. Could I just come back perhaps quickly on the ﬁrst one? So, do I
understand from your answer that actually that the model changes that you made had a
negligible impact on the life margins, but it was all due to other factors?

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

And so, if you look at the new business margin, the change we did in 2016 in the Swiss
model indeed accounts for 50% of the impact on the new business margin. The other
Page 6 of 17



Company Name: Baloise Holding AG
Company Ticker: BALN SW Equity
Date: 2017-08-30

50% are exactly the lowering guarantees, better business mix, less reserving and higher
interest rate margin we have. So, 50/50 more or less.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

FINAL

Right. Sorry.

A - Carsten Stolz

{BIO 6055047 <GO>}

And the model reﬁnement have been done in the full year closing 2016 and has not been
in eﬀect in the half year numbers 2016 that you see on the slide. So, that gives a little bit of
a distorted picture there if you compare half year to half year because the modeling
reﬁnement has been eﬀected in full year 2016.

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

I think we also discussed that at last year closing that the business model changes that we
did were fully in line with the market in the sense that before that, we actually were very,
very conservative on the model assumptions. So, we brought them actually just in line
with what the normal market does. So that's actually the impact of the model change.

Q - Peter D. Eliot

{BIO 7556214 <GO>}

Yeah. Thanks so much. Sorry for missing your ﬁrst comment there. Thanks.

The next question is from Jonny Urwin from UBS. Please go ahead.

Q - Jonny Urwin

{BIO 17445508 <GO>}

Hi there. Good morning. Just one last for me, please. So, just going back to the
underlying loss ratio development in non-life, so it obviously got a bit worse year-on-year,
almost 2 points. But I understand this can be volatile, but I'm just checking in to make sure
you're not seeing any sort of negative trends on claims inﬂation or anything on that. Could
you give us a quick rundown of where you see price increases running versus claims
inﬂation in each of your non-life markets, please? Thank you.

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

I think the markets in which we operate are always competitive, so there is always price
competition going on. That's, I think, not diﬀerent than before. It depends a bit on the
countries and on the branches, so they vary a bit. To give an example, the competition in
Switzerland in car business is now pretty strong. In Germany, the competition is overall
strong. Belgium, it's strong especially in SME and industry business, transport business.
So, it depends a bit and it varies also year to year. But we don't see a sort of a negative
trend, both in terms of claims inﬂation or in terms of price erosion. So, it's pretty stable. I
think looking at the half year numbers again, there are seasonal, there are sometimes
inﬂuenced. So, I think we should look at it at the NDF. So, this kind of volatility is pretty
normal half year.

Yes. Absolutely, they balance out.

Q - Jonny Urwin

The next question is from Michael Huttner from JPMorgan. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Michael Igor Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Fantastic. Thank you very much and well done for lovely results. Three, on the life – on
capital and solvency and then very brieﬂy on innovations. On life, the CHF 70 million, if
you hadn't added CHF 70 million, would we have seen a proﬁt of CHF 185 million? So,
that's the ﬁrst question.
The second is on the solvency. Will you say even after stress test should be above a 140%?
And then, quite a severe stress test, and then you say within the S&P model, you are at
AAA. Can you give us a feel for the stress test to look at? Because I know the next step, as
you say, is – or when I discussed with one of your colleagues, if you stress it again, you'd
still remain in the green. So, that kind of gives me the feeling that each of those stress
tests is about 30 points, 35 points, something like that. But to understand a little bit your
thinking here. And then, ﬁnally, on innovations, if you could give us two ﬁgures, maybe
the total investments so far in innovations in the digital and all these partnerships, and so
far also the revenues? Thank you.

A - Carsten Stolz

{BIO 6055047 <GO>}

Yeah.

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

You go ﬁrst, Carsten.

A - Carsten Stolz

{BIO 6055047 <GO>}

Oh, yes. Absolutely. Thank you for your question. First, on the life question. The answer is
yes. If we wouldn't have had the reserve strengthening of around CHF 70 million, then,
obviously, the results would have been higher. So, it's a yes. And on the solvency
question, that is a little bit more tricky. The numbers you mentioned, it's diﬃcult to
conﬁrm them because the stress test don't behave in a linear way. So, why are we taking
these stress tests, and they are both on the stressing relevance variables on the market
risk side or on the asset management side with stressing the interest rates and stressing
the share price performance. This is because this is big building blocks that has a direct
Page 8 of 17



Company Name: Baloise Holding AG

Date: 2017-08-30

FINAL

impact on the SST, much stronger than technical stress tests. So, that's why we take these
to excess. And with this 140%, we are – that translate more or less in one-in-25-years event,
bearing in mind of where we stand. So, that's the logic why we take these sensitivity
testing for showing our sensitivity to the regimes. The underlying calculation regimes are
still a moving target. So, that's why we remain cautious, but we are very close to what's
going on.
Innovation?

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Maybe on the innovation part, it depends how you deﬁne innovation and digitization in
terms of what are the investments. If you take a couple of examples, we have in our
partnership with Anthemis, we're investing CHF 50 million in European and U.S. start-ups.
First investment has been made in (24:08). If you look at MOVU and FRIDAY, those are
also investments in the true sense of the word, but they are less important.
If you look at FRIDAY today, we have invested approximately CHF 20 million. We have
also invested a lot in other new solutions, alternative business models, small insurances
for mobiles, for bikes, for watches and so forth. And in those small innovation projects,
additional services and additional insurance products, for every Swiss franc we invest, we
obtain CHF 3 of premium. So, actually, they are indeed proﬁtable, but they're all
investments in the future, and they require some time to mature.

Q - Michael Igor Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Great. Thank you very much. And just going brieﬂy back to solvency, if I may, only if I may.
But you have – S&P says you're AAA balance sheet but a single A rating. Where is the
diﬀerence? What do they not like about you?

A - Carsten Stolz

{BIO 6055047 <GO>}

I'll take the question with pleasure. Yes, we do have a AAA capitalization under the S&P
terms, but in the framework, they're looking at other variables as well, how the business
portfolio is constructed, what is in the business portfolio, what are the diﬀerent sources of
earnings. And it's more on the operational side, but they also looked at us. But with a
twinkle in my eye, maybe you ask them, and I would be interested in the answer as well.
That's the non-factual answer.

Q - Michael Igor Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Okay. Okay. Thank you. I'll try and do that. Thank you very much. Thank you.

A - Carsten Stolz

{BIO 6055047 <GO>}

But to be serious, again, I think it's – they do the combination of their diﬀerent criteria, and
the capitalization is outstanding, risk management as well. And if they would look at us,
they would certainly prefer to have a more and even more balanced business portfolio
from a geographical perspective I think.

The next question is from Stefan Schürmann from Bank Vontobel. Please go ahead, sir.

Q - Stefan Schürmann
Yes. Good morning. I have three questions. First one on the reserve releases again, the
5.2%. Can you provide us a bit more granularity of where that comes from by country or
maybe frequency or, again, claims inﬂation.
The second question on the life part, when I look at the proﬁt by source, risk result and
savings result is down year-on-year. Can you give some more details there, if there are
some one-oﬀs or if that's a trend?

Bloomberg Transcript

And the last one, just a small one on the third-party asset management. I see that basically
assets under management remain around CHF 5 billion. Can you give some indications
about net new money there or the whole development in general?

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

As Matthias hasn't said anything, let me propose that he starts with third question related
to asset management.

A - Matthias Henny

{BIO 17600048 <GO>}

Yes. Hello. Thanks for the question. We are currently in the process of building up our
third-party asset management capabilities. This naturally takes some time. We have built
up a sales force of three people to tackle the institutional market in Switzerland. We're
also in the process of transforming the real estate department in funds management
company. And the third initiative out of couple of initiatives that we're undertaking is the
Monviso robo advisor that we launched together with Deutsche Asset Management.
Currently, for a ﬁgure on net new assets under management, it's too early to tell.

Q - Stefan Schürmann
Okay.

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Your question with regard to the savings results and its development year-on-year, the
development is explained by that we have lower realizations in the ﬁrst half 2017 in

Page 10 of 17



Company Name: Baloise Holding AG
Company Ticker: BALN SW Equity
Date: 2017-08-30

comparison to 2016, as well as a little bit lower on current income as well. So, these two
factors explain the diﬀerence on the savings result.

Q - Stefan Schürmann

FINAL

Yes. Okay. And the risk result is down quite a bit as well. I mean, that's normal as expected
or...

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Yeah. The development on the risk result, if I may take this up right away, is mainly
explained by last year, because we had a positive one-oﬀ eﬀect in the ﬁrst half 2016 of
around CHF 40 million in the risk result. So, it's rather there where the
year-on-year comparison diﬀerence stems from – with regards to risk result development.

Q - Stefan Schürmann
Okay. Yeah.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Carsten Stolz

{BIO 6055047 <GO>}

In terms of the reserve releases in non-life, as we said before, it's half year. We don't see
those results to half year, so it's pretty volatile and there are seasonal eﬀects in there. I
think there's what we have seen and then that's also true for the last couple of years that
in Switzerland, (30:02) cases where actually there's still a number of reserve is being
released. In marine and transport, there are a number of reserve releases. So, there are no
big changes in terms of the sources. We consider them as normal, and we expect actually
the run rate of the reserves to be, on an annual basis, in the area of 2% to 3%.

Q - Stefan Schürmann
Okay. Yeah. Very helpful. Thanks.

Operator
The next question is a follow-up question from Guilhem Horvath from Exane. Please go
ahead, sir.

Q - Guilhem Horvath

{BIO 18460437 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you. The ﬁrst one, if I may, is going back on SST, maybe I missed it, but I
guess it's the ﬁrst time you mentioned this 140% as a bottom level. So, if it's the case, why
did you decide to speak about this 140% instead of just saying remaining in the green
zone? And does this mean that you are going to gradually communicate more and more
about SST going forward? And when should we expect you to give more granularity on
this?
And the second is, could you elaborate a little bit on M&A? And what you see as
opportunity? Then maybe speaking about Belgium a little bit, because there were some
Page 11 of 17

A - Matthias Henny

{BIO 17600048 <GO>}

Yes. Thanks for your follow-up questions with regards to the SST disclosure that you've
seen, we have disclosed a similar picture in the context of the Investor Day in August
2016, so we build on this. And if you look at the disclosure we had in the Investor Day
August 2016, if you half the distance between 100% and 200%, it's more or less where the
140% sits, but it's more connected to this one-in-25-year event consideration, and that's
where we think that we are going from green to blue.
And I think it's important if you compare these two disclosures from October 2016 and
2017 now to have a look in the bottom left-hand corner, which shows that the sensitivity
has decreased with regards to the impact of these scenarios on SST.
It is a small next step in terms of disclosure. We certainly need a sound and stable
disclosure environment. And, there, I'm referring mainly to substantial model discussions
still unresolved, but we'll follow up on this certainly. And as the view gets clearer, the
disclosure will step by step follow. If nothing substantially changes, then we will probably
disclose like this again in the full year. So, remains to be seen. I hope you can understand
this.

Q - Guilhem Horvath

{BIO 18460437 <GO>}

Yeah. Absolutely. Just going back on this. On the discussions regarding the standard
model for group life in Switzerland, what's your view on this? Do you rule the, I would say,
industry view which is that this will not lead to a more capital consuming model going
forward? And when do you expect this to lead to a ﬁnal implementation of the standard
model? Yeah.

A - Matthias Henny

{BIO 17600048 <GO>}

Yeah. It's an active and ongoing discussion between the regulator and the industry, as we
speak. And I would like to wait until the end of these discussions, so that we then can see
what the framework is going to be going forward.

Q - Guilhem Horvath

{BIO 18460437 <GO>}

Okay. And on M&A, please.

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

On M&A, I think, in the four countries we are active, we have always been looking at
opportunities. We'll continue to do that. Meaning, the business case and the cultural ﬁt
needs to be appropriate, but we're looking at all the opportunities that are presenting
itself in our four core countries. That's one.

Secondly, what else needs to be taken into account is that we see more and more, what I
would call, atypical M&A, which is alternative business models, which are initiatives like
FRIDAY or the acquisition of MOVU in Switzerland or the acquisition of DrivOlution, which
are more platform businesses. So, it's a combination, and I think that the M&A will be
balanced in between what we call the traditional M&A in which we are interested in our
four countries, and these alternative M&A models, where we are looking into alternative
business models and additional services.

The next question is from René Locher from MainFirst. Please go ahead.

Q - René Locher

Bloomberg Transcript

Yes. Good morning, everyone. Just a follow-up question on the life business on slide 19.
So, Gert, you just explained that the saving result is down due to lower current investment
income and lower realized gains in (36:18). I'm referring to page 21. So, perhaps, Mr.
Henny can explain to me. When I go to other in the current investment income last year,
other current investment equals CHF 137 million. And this year it's CHF 99 million. And I
guess, apart from ﬁxed income security, this is the main reason why the current
investment income is down. So, just wondering what are the main drivers here.
And it's amazing. Here, again, a follow-up. When you are telling us that if you don't have
to increase reserve like CHF 70 million in H1, then the EBIT would be CHF 185 million. So
this is amazing, because I was just checking in my model, and I'm looking at the period
2004 to 2006. So, the average EBIT was at CHF 226 million. Now, if we assume higher
interest rates, then I mean, EBIT life would go up to CHF 300 million, CHF 400 million or
is this too easy?
And then, yeah, perhaps quickly on this unit-linked, no, on the realized gains and losses
on investments, I mean, IR explained it to me this morning. So, the increase is mainly due
to the unit-linked business where investments are valued at market and, at the end of the
day, this is then (37:52) in the group P&L? Thank you.

A - Matthias Henny

{BIO 17600048 <GO>}

So, I would start with the question on current investment income of other. This had to do
with our shift or the change in structure of our senior secured loan investments. We were –
up until end of 2016, we were invested in third-party institutional funds and they were
classiﬁed in this other section. And as of this year, we have set up our own senior secured
loan fund which we can fully consolidate. And now, the income of these senior secured
loans is shown in ﬁxed income securities.

FINAL

Q - René Locher
Thank you.

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

And with regard to your question on the dynamic of the life results, on the back of higher
interest rates, we would see higher results, that's clear, further enhanced by our ambition
to improve our business mix with regard to lower guarantees in the new business
underwritten, as well as the run-oﬀ of the guarantees in the back book. When and
to what extent that will impact the EBIT, I wouldn't dare to say.

Q - René Locher
Yeah.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

But the direction is certainly right. And then, it certainly would also help cash generation
coming out from that, which is the key perspective. And the third aspect on the
development of the unrealized capital gains, it's correct, as you say. It's a combination of
the unit-linked business as well as of the other business, so there is a (40:06) in the
balance sheet on that.

Q - René Locher
Okay. Thank you. And then, very quickly, I mean, the shift in business mix, shouldn't I see
sooner or later an item, fee income, your proﬁt by sources in the life business?

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

Yes. It is – I mean, the fee income is currently in the diﬀerent driver, so...

Q - René Locher
Okay.

A - Gert De Winter

{BIO 19720616 <GO>}

...don't see that separately.

helpful just to show it as a stand-alone item.

The next question is a follow-up question from Michael Huttner, JPMorgan. Please go
ahead.

Q - Michael Igor Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Thank you. So, your competitor, Swiss Life, they calculate the return on equity excluding
bond gains and shareholders' equity excluding unrealized gains and bonds. I just
wondered what that ﬁgure would be for you. So, you had CHF 5.8 billion stated equity,
but if I exclude unrealized gains and bonds, I don't think it's a huge diﬀerence because a
lot of your bonds are held for maturity, but maybe you'd have a ﬁgure.
And then, if the – assuming the life proﬁtability is – the CHF 70 million was kind of very
voluntary (41:58) so, maybe, we'd be looking at CHF 700 million run rate in terms of
proﬁts. So, that would give me a (42:07) Swiss Life will be 10.5% or maybe 11%. And here,
the question is, can you enhance that more quickly by doing more of this innovation stuﬀ
or by accelerating your CapEx?
And then the ﬁnal question is what – in Germany, at one stage, you had said that you
could achieve – the aim would be to achieve proﬁtability similar to Belgium, which is
around CHF 50 million for half year, so CHF 100 million for full year in terms of EBIT, I
think. How far are you from kind of thinking that this can be achievable in Germany?

A - Carsten Stolz

{BIO 6055047 <GO>}

With regard to your question on ROE, in half year, we do not annualize ROE ﬁgures. So,
we like to look at these ﬁgures on a full-year basis. And then, that's – in that context, we
would like to look it as – our focus is on the cash generation currently. So, I would like to
look at ROE on full year terms, prevailing the guidance that we've given of 8% to 12% over
the cycle ROE, if you want to look at it from an accounting perspective.

Q - Michael Igor Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

Okay.

FINAL

And with regards to Germany, the focus is really on shifting our non-life portfolio into the
more proﬁtable segments and out of the volatile segments. So, what is more important is
that we actually start to generate a stable income and a stable cash generation out of
Germany, and we do not necessarily target fewer EBIT numbers, to be honest. So, focus is
on the core of business, the non-life change in portfolio and on generating cash from
Germany, which has not been the case over the last years.

Q - Michael Igor Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

And on the cash, if I may ask, so we've had a few references to it. I was wondering if I
missed something. Have you given the ﬁgure at the half year for this?

A - Carsten Stolz

{BIO 6055047 <GO>}

No. We don't have a cash disclosure half year yet. This is certainly one of the perspectives
that we will go deeper in the full year result with regards to referring to the CHF 2 billion
cash remittance target that we will look at in the full-year disclosure.

Q - Michael Igor Huttner

{BIO 1556863 <GO>}

And the CHF 2 billion, that's a ﬁve-year target?

A - Carsten Stolz

{BIO 6055047 <GO>}

Correct.

So, if there are no more questions, thanks again for the questions and the input. Again, I
think we've delivered in half year a very strong operational results as shown by the ﬁgures,
and we are very – we trust that we can actually continue 2017 to become a good year, and
are looking forward into the long-term future with our new strategy, which is delivering
the innovation in the digital world. Thank you very much.
