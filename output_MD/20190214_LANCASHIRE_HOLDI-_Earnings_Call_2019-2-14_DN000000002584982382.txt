Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to
today's Lancashire Holdings Limited Fourth Quarter 2018 Results Call. At this time, all
participants are in a listen-only mode. There will be a presentation followed by a question
and answer session. (Operator Instructions) I must advise you that this conference is being
recorded today, Thursday February 14, 2019.
I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Alex Maloney,
Group CEO. Thank you, and, please go ahead, sir.

Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for dialling in. During the fourth quarter of
2018, the insurance industry witnessed another series of cat events, with hurricane
Michael landing in Florida, and devastating wildfires in California. These insured losses will

FINAL

mean that 2018 is an above average year for losses and 2018 and 2017, are the highest
consecutive level of CAT insured losses on record.
Against this backdrop, I'm therefore delighted that the Lancashire Group has returned to
profits for the 2018 underwriting year, with 92.2% combined ratio, and a 2.4% return on
equity. The events of 2018 provided another important test of our risk management. We
have digested multiple large losses, still generated an underwriting profit, and we have
navigated volatile investment markets and still generated a positive return on
investments.

Bloomberg Transcript

We have grown our top line premiums by 8% this year. But the real growth is closer to
20% when we adjust for variables such as multi-year premiums reinstatement -- and
reinstatement premiums, et cetera. This has been driven by positive rate increases across
the majority of our product lines and the investments we made in three new underwriting
teams during 2018. We are seeing more new business than we have seen for a long time.
Some of which is adequately priced now rate increases have been achieved, but we're
still declining a large amount of new business that needs much more aggressive repricing
before we are prepared to accept these risks.
We have always said that we would adjust our underwriting, according to the market
conditions, the momentum we are now seeing is a clear indication of our view of the
underwriting environment and that it has improved but we are clear that after years of
rate reductions, there is still much work to be done to address underwriting profitability.
As the industry addresses the sins of the past, we believe that we will see a return more
sustainable returns with a balance of risk and return metrics will enable us to provide
better returns for our shareholders. The momentum in our business leaves us positively
positioned for the next stage of the underwriting cycle and we will look to maximize
opportunities. Our strategy will always remain the same. We will continue to demonstrate
the underwriting and capital discipline that we have had since the inception of our
company. Finally, I'd like to thank our shareholders for their support of our company and
our people for their commitment and dedication to our company. On our pass over to
Paul Gregory.

Thanks, Alex. Whilst 2018 has not seen the same loss quantum of natural catastrophes
2017. It has been above average loss share with natural catastrophes in numerous
territories providing another testing year for underwriting portfolios. In addition, there has
been a high frequency of risk losses in many of the specialty insurance classes adding to
the pressure to deliver underwriting profitability. With this in mind, I'm pleased with the
2018 combined ratio of 92.2% which demonstrates the quality of our inwards underwriting
and our reinsurance buying strategy.
2018 was the first year for many years where we seeing positive rate movement across
the majority of our portfolio. Albeit there was a clear difference in trend between
catastrophe exposed reinsurance lines and Specialty Insurance. In general, the reinsurance
lines saw better rate movement at the start of 2018 with price rises less pronounced as
the year progressed. Whereas in the majority of the specialty lines, the rating

FINAL

environment gradually improved as we progressed through the year. Across our entire
renewal portfolio we still right increases of approximately 5% year-on-year, it is in the
specialty insurance lines, that we expect to see continued incremental improvement in
rates through 2019.
Area showing the more significant rate rises on those lines, that have seen capacity
withdraw such as cargo, aviation, and specific areas of the D&F market, other lines such as
downstream, energy, and power are also seeing rate rises following a number of years of
poor underwriting performance and an increase in loss activity. This is all incrementally
positive for us.
Specialty insurance lines and now approximately two-thirds of our underwriting portfolio,
we have a strong track record of producing underwriting profitability in these classes,
even in the past five years, where rates have been historically low, our combined ratio for
specialty insurance has been in the low 80s. Therefore any positive movement in rate is
good for us.

Bloomberg Transcript

Last quarter, we stated we expected a flattish property market for 2019, and that is
effectively what we saw at 1.1. With some loss free territories such as Europe, some flat to
low-single-digit rate reductions and loss impacted territories and accounts seeing some
rate increases. It wasn't element of dislocation in the retro market 1.1, with rates increasing
and product offerings and structure changing. This combined with catastrophe events in
2018 working their way through the system, may provide fresh impetus for property cat
rates as we move through 2019, or albeit at this stage, our expectation remains for flattish
pricing in property cat.
Given the dislocation in the retro market, we were able to grow Kinesis at 1.1 for the
second year in a row. It was particularly pleasing to secure additional support from Kinesis
Capital providers, given the loss events over the past two years, as this support allows us
to grow our footprint in an area of the market, that's seing rate improvement.
We've also grown our footprint in the Specialty Insurance arena, adding three new
product lines during 2018. Our timing of entry into downstream energy, power, aviation
deductibles has been opportune, as we were entering these classes when the rating
environment in each of these products is improving. We were pleased to secure the
aviation deductible team in time to 2018 renewal season, which has allowed us to access
business a year earlier than expected.
This premium accounts for a large proportion of new business seen in Q4. Overall, our
three new product lines contributed approximately $40 million of gross written premium
in 2018. Importantly, these product lines have light capital requirements as the natural
catastrophe footprint is relatively limited compared to other lines of business.
As Alex mentioned, gross premiums have grown 8% year-on-year, underlying growth is
closer to 20%, once multi-year premium and reinstatement premium impact has been
catered for. The combination of an improved rating environment and new business has
delivered this growth -- whilst we also always very pleased to see rate improvement and
Page 3 of 16

FINAL

premium growth in all product lines. As always, we are fully cognizant of the base levels
from which we are coming from so we will continue to maximize risk and return and focus
on underwriting profitability and not just top-line growth. We remain cautiously optimistic
about 2019, given the improved rating outlook in specialty lines and the three new teams
being fully embedded within the business. I'll now pass over to Elaine.

Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Thanks, Paul. Following the third quarter's CATs closed out 2018 with wildfires in California.
Like last year, the wildfires in isolation would not have had the particularly significant
impact on the group. But in another well above average year losses they added to
mounting tally. The fourth quarter also included Hurricane Michael which occurred in early
October. Across the quarter loss events, we've recorded a net loss after recoveries of
$48.8 million. The fourth quarter also experienced significant volatility in the investment
markets and our investment portfolio lost 0.1%.

Bloomberg Transcript

Our RoE -- for the quarter was therefore negative with an RoE of negative 1.4% however
with lower overall losses for the year, we remained profitable for the year with an RoE of
2.4%, our combined ratio for the year was 92.2% and our investment return was 0.8%.
While the RoE we produce has clearly been impacted by the run of losses over the course
of the year. We remain pleased with the way of book performed across those events.
We've produced an underwriting profit. Our underwriting portfolio performed as
expected supported by our reinsurance program and also had a few nice reserve
releases come through this year as some older claims finally concluded.
On the investment side of our business, our portfolio structure protected the downside
as it's designed to do. Also pleasing was the grown in our gross premiums written in the
quarter. While we saw some strong new business flow in the property political risk book,
the new underwriters we've added to the business got off to a good start introducing
over $40 million dollars of new business to the group this year. While it will take some
time to build those books out and for the premiums to earn through, there is a
meaningful impact on our top line, particularly given that the fourth quarter is typically our
lowest volume quarter. We also had some to favourable reinstatement premium and prior
underwriting year adjustments in the quarter. It's only a small offset from the impact of
multi-year deals.
And as a reminder, the fourth quarter of 2017 was negatively impacted by some premium
adjustments to prior year (inaudible) offshore pro rata contracts due to the cancellation of
some projects. Our premium CDs increased this quarter largely due to increased
reinsurance and the new lines of business, we do have a significant quota share
partnership arrangement on our new aviation deductible book. The net impact of all that
was an increase in net earned premium relative to the fourth quarter of last year. Although
a lower percentage of earned to written given the higher relative volumes in the fourth
quarter of this year. Our acquisition cost ratios high again this quarter.
The fourth quarter of 2017 was somewhat artificially low given the adjustments made to
prior underwriting year contracts. The fourth quarter this year was also impacted by a

Page 4 of 16



Company N ame: L ancashire H oldings L td
Company Ticker: L RE L N Equity
Date: 2019-02-14

small number of contracts, with high brokerage and commissions, which skewed the ratio.
I would anticipate the ratio trading back to around 27% next year.

FINAL

As in previous years, we don't provide top-line guidance. However, we do expect to see
the benefits of the new teams we've hired in 2019, a continuation of the rate increases in
our specialty lines plus some new business opportunities across the rest of book.
As ever we will have some impact from the timing of multi-year and non-annual deals,
plus non-renewing lines of business like the political risk book. In 2018, the net reduction
on gross premiums written for multi-year and non-annual contracts, is about $60 million,
and I would expect the impact in 2019 to be slightly lower than that.
Our losses from Hurricane Michael on the individual wildfires are not significant. We've
broken out the impact of the combined events in our press release. The net loss of $48.8
million contributed 45.5% to our loss ratio for the quarter. Offsetting those losses, we had
net favorable prior year development for the quarter of $39.9 million. We had a 2009
accident year energy claim settle in our favour, some favourable development on last
year's CAT events, plus some general IBNR releases due to lack of reported claims
coming through.

Bloomberg Transcript

The succession of losses this year again meant we booked some losses under aggregate
covers. These are not individually significant. But I would characterize them as larger than
pure attritional losses.
However receipts, plus a slight uptick in attrition in the Cathedral book, our attrition
appears to be running higher than we've been guiding. When those are stripped out, we
remain comfortably in the mid 30s for attrition. We may see that tick up a little bit next
year though as the new lines of business, we are adding are a bit more attritional in
nature.
As I mentioned, investments produced a 0.1% loss for the quarter, driven primarily by
widening credit spreads and the sell-off in equities impacted our risk assets. The fixed
maturity portfolio performed well though -- and the overall portfolio structure mitigated
the downside impact of volatile quarter. While we expect volatility to continue and further
rate increases, we remain well positioned for both of those. We'll also have the benefit of
reinvesting at a higher rate and will gradually increase our duration to take advantage of
those higher rates. No changes in our investment strategy for 2019 though.
Our G&A ratio is reduced due to reductions in variable compensation and consulting fees
in the quarter. And financing costs for the quarter increased largely due to the mark-tomarket on our interest rate swaps and also some LSE costs. Lastly, on capital, we're
comfortable with the level we're carrying and that we still have plenty of capital to
underwrite the book we expect to underwrite this year. While maintaining our usual buffer
for other opportunities that may arise.
The new lines of businesses we've been adding are certainly not capital intensive. So we
don't need more capital to grow those. We're declaring our normal final ordinary dividend
Page 5 of 16

of $0.10 per share or $20 million and as ever, we're monitoring underwriting opportunities
and adjust our capital accordingly.
With that, I'll now hand over to the Operator for questions.

Questions And Answers
Operator
(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Kamran Hossain of RBC.
Please ask your question.

Q - Kamran Hossain

{BIO 17666412 <GO>}

Hi everyone. Two questions from me. First one is, the talk about new business, obviously
it's great news that business is coming back. And you're seeing it. Could you maybe give
a flavor or sense of where that business is coming back from? Is this kind of U.S. domestic
players et cetera, where that's coming from? And the second question, you're probably
unlikely to give me an exact answer. But if we think about Q1 pricing. Is it safe to say that
the Q1 RPI probably gets a bit of a bump from marine numbers, given kind of wasting of
things there -- just any kind of colour on that would be helpful. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

So I think on the new business front, I think what's happening at the moment in the market
is, as people are pulling out of lines of business, or just reassessing profitability. And just
generally cutting back, we are seeing new business opportunities. So a real life example
would be Cargo. So our cargo team will see a lot more new business. And some of that
new business with adjusted rate increases will hit the metrics we need. But there's still a
lot of business that needs much more aggressive re-pricing, we are modestly sort of like
confident about rates going in the right direction, and that's great. But we can't forget
where we're coming from. So I think that what the industry needs and what everyone
needs to do is just look at where rates are and some product lines need probably
multiples of where they are or some individual risks need, huge rate hikes to get to
something that's adequate and other businesses -- better priced. So yes, we are seeing
new business, there's still an awful lot of that wouldn't hit the metrics that we need but, it
is a clear indication that things have changed and the industry as a whole is trying to
increase the profitability after two very tough years. Paul do you want to talk about the 1:1?

A - Paul Gregory

{BIO 16314515 <GO>}

Yes, So. Hi, Cameron. In Q1, there will be some loss impacted marine business. So on the
marine, RPI that will obviously come through the numbers and you'll see that on the next
earnings call. As an overall comment though, 1:1 across the portfolio, you're taking
everything into account, everything's premium weighted and you're kind of in the mid
single-digit rate rises across the whole portfolio. So that's kind of what we're seeing at the
moment, obviously we've got some more Q1 business to go. But that's what we're seeing
at the moment, and basically, and in line with commentary, you will see in terms of the
specialty lines, seeing rate increases, reinsurance lines outside of Retro, broadly flat. So
Page 6 of 16

Company Ticker: L RE L N Equity
Date: 2019-02-14

that's kind of where you're getting the balance, also remember that in some of the new
lines of business, particularly power and aviation deductible, albeit aviation deductible isn't
really a key one. Issue --not all the business we write will come through in RPIs, because
it's new business, and RPIs are only based on renewal business.

Brilliant. Alex, Paul, thanks very much for your comments.

Your next question comes from the line of Thomas Fossard of HSBC. Please ask your
question.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Thomas Fossard

{BIO 1941215 <GO>}

Good afternoon everyone. Two or three questions on my side. The first one, would be on
the PML, looking at the changes in your PML exposures. Could you explain what has driven
the 2025 reduction in the US and European hurricanes and windstorm risk for the 100 year
return period and a bit more for 250 years? And connecting to that, second question
could be, would be on the capitalization of the Group. So, could you please update us on
the Q1 capital position of the Lancashire at the end of the year on the S&P model, which
remains your binding constraints. I think that S&P in its last report was pointing to the fact
that you had a 10% redundancy over the year. AAA confidence level. So any update on
that would be useful. And, the last question would be on the credit quality of the
investment portfolio. It is slightly down from the AA Minus to A Plus. So anything specific to
mention here? Thank you.

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Okay, Thomas. So just one thing on PMLs, that I just want to make very clear and then I'll
hand over to Paul and then Elaine will clearly answer the other questions. Is that when -our PML's can move around at anytime and Paul explain why they've moved, but when we
look at PML's and the way we think about PML's, it is one measure of how we look at our
business, and we have pretty much bought exactly the same reinsurance program as we
have done year-on-year. So there's no massive material change there, although the PML's
have moved. So the PML for us when we're thinking about our business it is one measure,
we look at and I just wanna be clear -- clear on that. Paul, would you just want to explain--

A - Paul Gregory

{BIO 16314515 <GO>}

Yeah, I mean there are, there out there are some movements as you say,Thomas and
some of that relates to inward changes in the inward book at 1:1, there were some areas
where there was some opportunity to write more business and others where we decided
to write a little bit less and that is mainly driven by the rating environments that we saw
there. As Alex said reinsurance across the Group is broadly the same, but there are some
changes in some areas, which also kind of feeds through to the PML's. So there is a
number of moving parts.

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

And on the capital side of things. S&P wouldn't be the primary measure that we look at,
we look a lot of different models and a lot of measures around capital AM Best is
probably one that we pay the most attention to, and generally, we are thinking about
capital, we look at where we are in the AM Best model, stress it and then put some head
on, on top of that, and that, generally means that we're comfortable under the other
models as well. So, and I wouldn't expect any material change in the S&P model. And then
on the quality of the investment portfolio, Denise is here, so I'll let her take that one.

A - Denise O Donoghue

{BIO 18659727 <GO>}

Hi Thomas. Essentially there is not much difference -- like there's a fine line between the
double A minus and A plus and we just liquidated more agency debt and treasuries for -to fund some of the payments we had going of Q4 with the volatility we just chose to
take less risk like take the quality securities out but it'll it rebalance and probably jump
back up to double A manner, Q1, Q2.

Q - Unidentified Participant
Okay, very good. Thank you.

Thank you, and -- Next question comes from the line of Edward Morris of JP Morgan.
Please ask your question.

Q - Edward Morris

{BIO 16274236 <GO>}

Hi, thanks everyone for taking the questions. The first, I just, I know you wouldn't give us
sort of proper guidance on premiums. But I wondered if you could just help us a little bit,
think about the trajectory going forward, because you've talked about this 20% underlying
growth, obviously, we have this dynamic to think about with the multiyear effects. Can you
just sort of give us a feel for what you think is realistic to expect over the next few years,
given the teams that you've added, presumably we should expect growth to continue,
but some sort of range would be helpful. And secondly, a question on dividends, please
for the last two years, your dividends have been -- DPS has been higher than EPS and
actually, I think if I go back the last 4 or 5 years, that's been the case. Looking ahead, if the
growth outlook changes, can you just give us a feel for what we should expect in terms of
dividends, should we, I mean I usually pencil in something close to a 100% payout ratio.
But if you start growing, is this too optimistic or just a feel for where we are on the
dividend outlook would be good. Thank you.

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

So, I am absolutely not going to give you any kind of range whatsoever. (Multiple

FINAL

Perhaps maybe a very brief -- just rephrase slightly then, the 20% underlying growth that
you talk about for the year, is there any reason why we should expect on an underlying
basis that not to continue going forward. Will the new teams that you've added, is it
purely the reflection of adding those new teams, does that imply anything for the
trajectory going forward?

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

We've had some growth in those teams this year and there's also our kind of normal new
business run rate, if you like. So we said because of the $40 million of premium for the
year, 40, 45 in the new teams and there's probably about 55 or so just kind of our normal
and run rate. Now, those new teams have come in early, we've got them in and managed
to get some premium in this year. So that book will renew into the next year, so there will
be an element of new business, but probably not the same kind of magnitude as we've
seen this year.

Q - Edward Morris

{BIO 16274236 <GO>}

Okay, a little, thank you.

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

And then dividends -- I'm not going to give you any guidance on that either.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

But one point on that, it will always depend on what line of businesses we invest in,
because the lines that we have invested in, in 2018 as I said in my commentary, are
relatively capital light, so you don't need additional capital particularly to underwrite the
specialty insurance lines of business. So it's always worth bearing that in mind, obviously if
opportunities come up in capital heavy lines retro property CAT. Then that's a different
story.

Q - Edward Morris

{BIO 16274236 <GO>}

Yeah, okay, fair enough. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Andreas van Embden of Peel
Hunt. Please ask your question.

Q - Andreas van Embden

{BIO 1795530 <GO>}

Hello, good afternoon. I have two questions please. One is on the attritional loss ratio,
could you maybe describe the difference between the attritional loss ratio on the new
business as being put on the books, relative to your 35%, which should in theory or mid
'30s run rate?

Page 9 of 16

And the second question is, I see that the actual holding has become group supervised
by the BMA on January 1 and then your tax resident and Bermuda -- does that change
anything, at all? Thanks.

FINAL

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

So, let me answer the first one. On the Group supervision Andreas -- it doesn't actually
change anything for us. I mean, we are -- we've always had a big presence in Bermuda
and that continues. So it doesn't change anything really. I suppose, the Bermuda model
fits the way we think about our business. So it's probably easier for us to sort of translate
when you think about the way a regulator will look at Lancashire, is just a bit more relevant
to way we think about our business, but there is no changes that will be obvious or
necessary. So it's pretty much business as usual.

Q - Andreas van Embden

{BIO 1795530 <GO>}

All right, thanks.

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

And in terms of the attritional loss ratio. The new lines are a little bit more heavy in the
attrition, and if we've been guiding to kind of 34, 35 before then. I would bring that up a
little bit, so maybe a look at some small like 36, 37 going forward.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Unidentified Participant
Andreas, on that, every product line has a different profile and some of the new lines that
we've invested in are a bit more volatile and heavier on the claims experience. So if we
add new product lines or the business mix changes, we'll always reassess where we're at,
and in the same way that, if we've -- if there was an opportunity to write lots more
terrorism business and then obviously that would move numbers around again. So it just
depends on the business mix on whether our--

Q - Andreas van Embden

{BIO 1795530 <GO>}

Would that -- sorry, as a follow-up, would that mean that your attritional, the volatility of
your attritional claims is going to increase as well? Particularly man-made losses?

A - Denise O Donoghue

{BIO 18659727 <GO>}

I wouldn't see the volatility increasing I think -- and it just acknowledging that there is
higher attrition that comes through generally on those lines of business.

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Yes.

Q - Andreas van Embden

Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ben Cohen of Investec. Please ask
your question.

FINAL

Q - Ben Cohen

{BIO 1541726 <GO>}

Thanks very much. It was really just a point of clarification, at this point. Just to come back
in terms of the growth that we can expect next year. I think, Elaine you said that there's
$45 million coming from new teams. I wonder, how much of that was in 2018 and of the
sort of the new business in Q4, that you had from those new teams. How much, if we go
forward a year, how much would you expect that there will sort of naturally be a growth
just from the fact that sort of further bedded down when we're year further out, or
maybe it's really just the clarity about where that $45 million splits between the two years
that I haven't quite got hold of ? Thanks.

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Ben. So the $45 million was all in 2018 and if you take a look at the Premium page in
our supplement and you can see the aviation deductible lines split out, there was a little
be that was done in Lancashire and a little bit that was done in Cathedral. You will see the
onshore energy line of business under Lancashire which is new staff. And then within both
marine and energy under Cathedral this new business coming through in there too, also
little bit more in the aviation line of business. We'd expect that business to mostly renew
and also to have a bit more new business on top of that. Mostly from the aviation
deductible line of business.

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Yes. So, Ben if you think about it. We went into onshore energy at the start of the year. So
we have had a full year on that class. But we would expect to see some modest growth in
that through the year because the rating environment has improved and we were year
end. So, we'd expect to see some new business. And power we started halfway through
the year. Well, in May, so pretty much halfway through the year. So again, we would expect
to see some modest growth in that as we have the first half of the year, renewals to go
through that is a smaller line of business, we were able to get the aviation deductible
team in for Q4 renewal season. Which is, you know, is the big aviation renewal season. So
we've picked up a lot of that growth a year early. They should still be some growth on that
class next year, but you wouldn't expect to see that until Q4 '19 which is the big renewal
season for aviation. Does that help?

Q - Ben Cohen

{BIO 1541726 <GO>}

Yes, it does. Absolutely. Could I just ask, just as a follow-on question on the aviation
deductible. You mentioned a relatively big quota share on that, on that book. Could you
just talk us to why, why you do that, is it can it just be very volatile how, does it fit into your
sort of overall sense of risk, if you like?

FINAL

Well, for every line of business, we obviously look at what's the most appropriate
reinsurance structure and for that class we deemed the quota share option to be the
most appropriate, we were able to do that with some existing reinsurers that we have
that know that team and know the Lancashire Group well, and that class business just
more suited to that type of arrangement. It is obviously a new class of business for us as
well. So when we get round to next year we will obviously review if it's still appropriate,
but at the moment. That's the of most appropriate reinsurance structure for that class.

Yes, hi. From my side as well. The first question will be on dividends basicly, historically you
been paying a special after Q3, mainly because you were quite exposed to hurricane risk
in the US. As the portfolio is changing, as you are buying quite a lot reinsurance right now,
do you think there is any rationale around changing those specials into year-end. And just
to double check, knowing what you know today about the level of large losses of that you
have incurred in Q4, would you still have paid the dividend that you did last quarter.
And then the other question would be on Kinesis, you have said that, you have ordered
new business there. Can you give us an update on AUM or additional AUM for 2019?

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Okay, Elaine do you want to comment on this one?

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Sure, and in terms of the dividend that we paid last quarter, absolutely would still have
paid it, when we look at -- the thing about dividends is about the capital that we need to
underwrite the portfolio, a buffer on there for any opportunities and then kind of what's
left on that. So, and we had capital in excess of the dividend that we paid out and we're
more than comfortable with that. And in terms of timing, I think timing of dividends,
special dividends is always going to be dictated by outlook. If we think that we can and
better underwrite opportunity at 1:1 then individually a special, if we think that we have a
really clear outlook then maybe we would stick with the normal timing.

A - Darren Redhead

{BIO 17995744 <GO>}

Hi it's Darren from Kinesis -- so regarding the AUM, as my colleague Elaine says, we never
give you guidance pre an AUM, but it's gone up 20% year on year.

Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Joanna Parsons of Canaccord.
Please ask your question.

Q - Joanna Parsons

{BIO 1558226 <GO>}

Thank you. Couple of questions from me. Just in terms of your gross premium written
split going forward now that you've added these new teams on, is there going to be any
notable shift in the timing of the premiums being written, because obviously as you say,
aviation deductible is a 4th quarter. But do the teams that you've added elsewhere in the
book, do they change that at all? And then on Kinesis, you talked when we met in January
better about the potential improvement in the outlook, especially on the Retro, but there
has been comment about more of that to come. Could you give us a bit more of a feel of
what you are expecting through the rest of this year for Kinesis. Thank you.

A - Elaine Whelan

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi, Joanna, I think typically our first half of the year, we'd write about 63%, 64% of our
book, and it kind of moved a little bit this year, with the new lines of business, and it will
still sit in that kind of 60% to 65% range for the first half going forward, and obviously with
the aviation deductible team that's a big Q4 renewal, that we do expect to see some
more new business coming into through the rest of the year.

Q - Joanna Parsons

{BIO 1558226 <GO>}

Okay, thank you.

A - Darren Redhead

{BIO 17995744 <GO>}

Hi, Joanna, it's Darren. Yes, we said, we grew our year end by 20%. We think, as Paul
touched on earlier, we've seen good opportunities within the sector, that Kinesis
underwrites we've seen pricing up 10%, we've actually taken chance to de-risk our
portfolio a little bit. Regarding opportunities during the year. Yes, we think will be a few
hopefully the market keeps on its positive trend. Florida will be a fascinating sector, but
we'll look to -- might deploy more capital if we see more opportunities during the year.

(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Joanna Parsons. Please
ask your question.

Q - Joanna Parsons

{BIO 1558226 <GO>}

So one last question from me, I'm coming back to the dividend. Actually you've had a
stated policy of the low base dividend and then the specials. Would you ever consider
increasing the base dividend a bit and then bringing back the size of the special you pay
out, and if not, could you explain a bit, your philosophy behind your dividend policy?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Sure, Joanna. I guess, the approach the order of the dividend has always been to do a
small amount so that we're in complete control of our capital. I mean, arguably we could
increase a little bit, but we like to have the -- ability to make a decision on the special. So if
we want to keep more capital for underwriting, then we're not tied down to a committed
dividend amount.

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Yes, Joanna -- I think our current policy just gives us maximum flexibility and that maybe
what we like.

Q - Joanna Parsons

{BIO 1558226 <GO>}

Hi. two questions please, first of all, I'm not sure if I missed it, what kind of rates did you
achieve on the new business at 1:1, and secondly, can you talk about your reinsurance

spending for 2019? And is there any changes to the structure? Thank you.

FINAL

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Yeah, on the first question we got asked, we talked about the RPIs at 1:1 across the
portfolio there, they're broadly in the mid-single digit range, as in positive. Specifically with
regard to the new business lines, in areas like onshore energy we are seeing rate
increases in the double-digit range. That market is starting to move again coming from a
very low base in the power class we're seeing rate rises in the mid-single digit ranges and
in aviation deductible, albeit there not huge amount at 1.1. But what we saw in Q4 was
pricing improvements in the double digit range. So on the three new classes of business
that's what we're currently seeing in the market. And sorry, what was the second question.

A - Elaine Whelan

{BIO 17002364 <GO>}

Insurance spend -- as Alex said, we have kind of broadly renewed our reinsurance
program as it was, a few changes around the edges but you should expect to see
reinsurance spend go up a bit next year, given the new lines of business that we've got
and the reinsurance support for those, particularly given aviation deductible, remember
we mentioned that the significant growth share on that.

Thank you. And your next question comes from the line of Nicholas Johnson of Numis
Securities, please ask your question.

Q - Nicholas Johnson

{BIO 1774629 <GO>}

Hi -- just very quickly, I was wondering if you could just give a bit of an update on what
you're seeing in the offshore energy market -- obviously I think the oil price has come
down a bit since the last quarter, just wonder if you could update on what levels of
demand you're seeing as you go into the April renewal season. Thanks.

A - Alex Maloney

{BIO 16314494 <GO>}

Hi, Nick. And I'll take that. So you're right, the oil price has reasonably volatile through '18,
we are still seeing increases in demand from our clients and the tone from our clients
remains more positive than it has been in recent years, adjusting with the volatility, some
of that demand coming through may take a little bit longer. But we are seeing some of
our clients do, going back to work, drilling more wells, it's just maybe a little bit slower
given the recent volatility in oil price. But the trend is positive, which is good. And then in
terms of rating environment, the upstream energy market continues to be positive, it's
low-single digit rate rises, which is the second year, we're seeing that. But that's
effectively because we haven't seen any significant capacity leave the upstream energy
market. But we are seeing demand increase incrementally, and as I've said rates are
slowly improving, so it's a better story, but it's just a slow burn.
