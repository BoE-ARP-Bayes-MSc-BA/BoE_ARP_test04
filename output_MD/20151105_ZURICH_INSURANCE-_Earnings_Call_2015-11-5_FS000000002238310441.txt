conference is being recorded. After the presentation, there will be a Q&A session. The
conference must not be recorded for publication or broadcast.
At this time, it's my pleasure to hand over to Mr. James Quin, Head of Investor Relations
and Performance Management. Please go ahead, sir.

James Quin

{BIO 18345789 <GO>}

Good morning, good afternoon, and welcome to Zurich Insurance Group's Q3 Results
Presentation. I'm joined by our CEO, Martin Senn; CFO, George Quinn; and Kristof Terryn,

the CEO of the General Insurance business.
Martin will make a few short comments before handing over to Kristof and then George.
We'll then take your questions. As usual, please keep to two questions.

FINAL

I'll now hand over to Martin.

Martin Senn

{BIO 3241585 <GO>}

Thank you very much, James, and welcome to everyone on the call on my behalf as well.
Zurich's operating results for the third quarter of 2015 are a disappointing outcome for
the group. As we announced on September 21, results for our General Insurance business
has been impacted by adverse claims experience in certain portfolios, including a further
increase in large losses in comparison to the ﬁrst half of the year, negative prior
development in some portfolios in North America and $275 million in claims relating to
the Tianjin Port explosions. These factors have, in aggregate, led to our GI business
reporting a loss of slightly less than $200 million and a combined ratio of around 109% for
the third quarter.

Bloomberg Transcript

While we are not satisﬁed with the outcome, this result is in line with our preliminary
announcements. In response to the recent performance issue within General Insurance,
we commenced an operational review of the business in early September. This review has
led to an agreed set of comprehensive actions to improve performance and to get us
back on track.
Kristof will give you more information on this review shortly, but I'm very encouraged by
the response of the business, and I'm absolutely convinced that we have the actions in
place to start rebuilding the credibility of our GI business with investors. Equally, while we
need to improve proﬁtability in certain parts of General Insurance, this should not detract
from the good progress in other parts of the group or from our continued capital strength
and excellent cash generation track records.
For the nine months ended September 30, our life business has reported 18% growth in
both business operating proﬁt and in new business sales at constant currency. And at
Farmers Exchanges, which we do not own, modest but steady growth in gross premiums
is starting to translate into higher revenues for Farmers Management Services.
In terms of our ﬁnancial position, solvency, as measured by the Zurich Economic Capital
Model, was slightly above the top of our target range at the end of June. While this is
likely to have dipped slightly due to the weak Q3 results and recent market movements,
we continue to be in a very strong position. In addition, while GI's challenges will likely
have some impact on cash remittances in 2016, we still expect to generate an excess of
$10 billion of cumulative cash remittances in the three years from 2014 to 2016. This is
more than $1 billion ahead of our target.
These strengths enable us to reiterate our commitment to deploying $3 billion excess
capital by the end of 2016, and this remains a key step in how we want to improve returns
Page 2 of 25



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG
Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2015-11-05

and achieve an ROE within our target range of 12% to 14% next year.

FINAL

As mentioned in the results commentary, we will set out how the $3 billion of excess
capital will be allocated between organic or inorganic investments and cash returns to
investors of both our ordinary dividend with full year results.
And with that, I will hand over to Kristof now who will give you some more details about
the outcome of his review of the GI business. Thank you very much.

Kristof Terryn

{BIO 17664174 <GO>}

Thank you, Martin. Now, as highlighted earlier, the recent performance of our GI business
has been disappointing and the review we initiated in Q3 built on some of the actions that
were already underway at the half year. Now, this review focused on ﬁve elements, from
understanding the ﬁnancial strength of the business all the way to governance. However,
the two most important elements that we focus on were the improvement of our
underwriting performance and an accelerated drive towards greater eﬃciency.

Bloomberg Transcript

Now, while the underwriting review is broad in nature, the immediate focus has been on
the 16% of our business that is generating the largest underwriting losses. For these
portfolios, we've put in place some very concrete actions for underwriting improvements
with detailed weekly tracking, leading up to the January 1 renewal.
Now let me also stress here that this is not just about exiting underperforming portfolios.
It is about focusing our eﬀorts and taking tough underwriting actions where it make
sense, while considering achievability and our long term customer relationships. That
being said, we have made decisions to exit portfolios where we think it is not realistic to
turn them around. Some of these we've already mentioned, for example, the U.S. trucking
business and the standalone global corporate boiler or machinery line.
Now, within the overall targeted portfolios, we will be focusing on achieving rate and/or
lift, recognizing that in some markets and lines of business, rates are still softening. Now,
this is where tiering will be a key lever with a particular focus on ﬁnding a better balance
between risk levels and pricing. And for some of the bottom tiers of our underperforming
portfolios, this will mean some very signiﬁcant rate increases, often at the expense of a
signiﬁcant drop in retention levels.
Now, while the core focus is on restoring proﬁtability, inevitably, we will see an impact on
top line, but this is not about shrinking to success. We are taking a targeted and
diﬀerentiated approach, and we will continue to invest in those areas where we are
getting traction and delivering top line at the hurdles we expect. Examples of this are our
Swiss business and our North American commercial business.
Now, with regard to eﬃciency, there were a number of actions already taken, which we
expect to start showing through in 2016 and continue beyond. Some of these initiatives
addressed a layer of expense about the businesses in both the regions and at the center,

Page 3 of 25



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG
Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2015-11-05

but we are also reviewing our footprint and reassessing some of the investments that we
have made or intended to make.

FINAL

And ﬁnally, we'll continue to reduce our expense base beyond 2016 as part of the group's
overall ambition to reduce expenses by at least $1 billion by the end of 2018.
Now with these actions, I believe we can achieve the required short-term proﬁtability
improvements while positioning the business for long-term success. And with that, let me
hand over to George.

George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thanks, Kristof. And before we turn to the questions, let me make a couple of quick
comments on the results.

Bloomberg Transcript

As you all have seen, the results for GI are in line with the preliminary indications although
there are some changes in the mix of the numbers. To be more speciﬁc, we've
incorporated an expectation of normal nat cat losses for September in the preliminary
indication. But in the ﬁnal event, we've actually had very limited nat cat losses in
September. We also took a decision after the end of the quarter to be more prudent in
one speciﬁc sub portfolio of our construction liability business in the U.S. These two items
oﬀset each other. I'm well aware that the second set will further fuel a debate about the
overall reserve position of the choices available to us this seemed to me to be the best
one.
I want to reiterate a couple of points about the reserve position. First, I mean, there are a
number of well-known one-oﬀ factors in Q3 but most portfolios are showing expected
modest releases. Secondly, we believe we have prudently reserved and our reserves are
set above the midpoint in the range.
Third, we believe the reserving process is robust and we have multiple levels of both
internal and external reviews in place with a generally consistent view of overall reserve
strength. Obviously, we need to demonstrate a more consistent track record in the
coming quarters and to actually deliver PYD within the 1% to 2% range that we've guided
to. Of course, no one could predict how our reserves will evolve precisely but with the
actions taken in Q3, I believe we're in a stronger position and with lower levels of
expected volatility.
Together with the underwriting expense actions that Kristof's highlighted, we are
conﬁdent that we can improve our combined ratio by 2 points to 3 points in 2016 from the
adjusted starting point of a 99.5% combined ratio, taking into account expectations for
top-line evolution and what we can see today in the external market environment.
With that, we look forward to answering your questions.

We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The ﬁrst question is from Farooq
Hanif from Citigroup. Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Hi there. Thanks very much. I'll just keep it to two. Can you talk about the top line. In your
pre-prepared statement you used the word modest top-line decline, and it just seems to
me, especially what you're saying now as well as such a large portion of your portfolio is
making kind of 140% plus or whatever the combined ratio of that, yet it seems to me that
the risk there is quite signiﬁcant that you see quite – a more major drop in top line. So
could you just talk about why you think that might not happen?
And then secondly, how conﬁdent can you leave us that you don't need to extend this
review of businesses to other areas such as EMEA? I mean, I know the ratios right now are
good and therefore the immediate kind of evidence is that they are working well. But
given the history of the group, why are you not extending that? Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - Kristof Terryn

{BIO 17664174 <GO>}

So maybe let me take that question. So ﬁrst of all, on the top line, I mean as I said, we will
have a very diﬀerentiated approach, and clearly, some of the areas that are
underperforming will see the business shrinking in the single digit percentages, probably.
And I don't have an absolute top line number for the business for next year. I mean, the
key focus really is on getting the proﬁtability, the underwriting proﬁtability of all the
business ﬁxed.
Now, again, even within some of the portfolios that are underperforming, we are very
diﬀerentiated. I mean, we look at lines of business as part of an overall client relationship
from a distributor angle as well, and we'll take very diﬀerent actions on the bottom tiers of
those portfolios than we will on those that are actually performing. So I think, in
aggregate, a modest decline is probably still the best view that we have. That being said,
clearly, the focus will be on proﬁtability and restoring the business to proﬁtability.
Now, on extending the review, I want to make one thing clear. While we talk about 15
underperforming portfolios, I mean the underwriting review that we did was broad in
nature and covered all of our portfolios. Now, the actions are targeted towards those 15
portfolios, but we are comfortable with what we're seeing in some of the other portfolios.

Q - Farooq Hanif

{BIO 4780978 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you very much.

The next question is from Daniel Bischof of Helvea. Please go ahead.

Q - Daniel Bischof

{BIO 17407166 <GO>}

FINAL

Yes. Good afternoon. Two questions, please. The ﬁrst one on the competitive situation in
Global Corporate. Some of your peers noted that this remains an intensely competitive
area. So in your combined ratio forecast, what sort of range changes are embedded for
2016 especially in Global Corporate and North America Commercial?
And then the second on M&A, I think in one of your earlier comments you mentioned that
the most likely development of deploying excess capital is a combination of bolt-on
acquisitions and cash returns. So, how do you see the M&A market these days and where
do you see opportunities?

A - Kristof Terryn

{BIO 17664174 <GO>}

Maybe let me take the ﬁrst question on the competitive situation in Global Corporate. So
it is true that this is a competitive market. There's quite a bit of capital available within this
market, and so the pressure on rate is likely to continue.

Bloomberg Transcript

I mean as I said before, the impact on our portfolio will be diﬀerentiated. And given some
of the underperformance in some of our Global Corporate business, particularly on the
property portfolio and in North America, that is where you are likely to see some
signiﬁcant impact.
The improvement of the portfolio is not dependent – just dependent on rate. A lot of the
improvement we are likely to see from lift, which is really a shift in the proﬁtability of the
portfolio through the tiering exercise. Because, I think it is unlikely to see a big change in
what the market will tolerate in terms of rate increases going into 2016.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Daniel, on the second point on M&A, let me just reiterate, that the priorities for us for the
use of excess capital haven't changed. So, ﬁrst of all, growth, organic and inorganic; and
then second, the return to shareholders, the excess that we can't use in supporting the
growth of the business. As you've seen, we've set a clear time horizon for us to reach a
conclusion on that, so it has an impact on 2016.
From an overall M&A market perspective, I mean, I think it's very hard to judge. I mean
you can see the transactions that I can see taking place. I guess what's most important to
us is that I mean if we did commit capital in M&A, we'll apply the discipline that we've
talked about before, so the level of returns that we achieve on the invested capital is very
important to us, and the benchmarks that we use to establish those returns are also very
relevant. And, of course, one of the most important ones is our own share price. So, I
mean, more than that in terms of the , we won't know it at this stage.

Q - Daniel Bischof

{BIO 17407166 <GO>}

Excellent. Thanks a lot.

The next question is from Andy Hughes from Macquarie. Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

Hi. Thanks very much, guys. And I guess the ﬁrst question was on the increased
reinsurance you're planning to buy on the kind of Global Corporate business, does that
have a beneﬁt to the capital position? And also is there kind of a cost to that? Or is that
oﬀset by the falling reinsurance prices?
The second question was on the kind of commercial auto business. I guess peers have
seen similar problems in commercial auto, so I was a bit surprised when you sort of talked
about a 4% rate increase. And I thought it could be a lot more than that. So, I guess I'm
interested in how much the transportation book has caused of the losses you can see on
slide 25? And does the business work very diﬀerent ex the transportation book? Thank
you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

So, on the ﬁrst one, I guess, just to avoid that I give the signal to our insurance partners
that we're willing to buy reinsurance at any price. We are evaluating the risks in sort of
buying more reinsurance. But again, given the accumulation of large losses and some of
the things that Kristof has talked about is actually focused on the incoming business to try
and reduce the exposure that we have to some of those. And then beyond that, we would
like to try and reduce the volatility generally. And I think in that way, reinsurance can play
a role.
I mean, I guess the challenge is that doesn't come free of cost. I mean, I think obviously I
mean the market is softer than it's been for some time, to make anyone say give it away –
that we would expect to have some beneﬁt in the capital position but again it depends on
the lines of business that it attaches to. But it would come at some marginal cost to the
sum overall, would be our best expectation at this time.
On commercial auto, I mean obviously, commercial auto is one of the triggering points of
the preliminary release of the Q3 that we made in September. It was a large part, both the
current year and the prior year of the $300 million charge that we identiﬁed there net in
the GI business. And in fact, about $140 million of it was driven by commercial auto.
If you go back to some of the comments that Kristof made about particular lines of
business, I mean, obviously you'd expect that there are some sub-segments of the
commercial auto market where we see the most signiﬁcant negative loss cost trends are
going to be very high on the list of priority for us to target. I mean, we have a particular
exposure on some of the larger trucking end of the market and that's an area that we're
going to tackle with vigor before we go into next year.
So, I mean, again, I think through a combination of that and pushing across the board on
commercial auto, we expect to see a signiﬁcant improvement. On the rate that you're
seeing, remember, I mean the rate picture is obviously backward looking. I mean the

Page 7 of 25

Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2015-11-05

exact extent of the issue that we face in commercial auto, I think, became clearer to us
during the quarter. You're going to see more radical action from this point onwards.

Q - Andy Hughes

{BIO 15036395 <GO>}

FINAL

Thank you.

The next question is from Andrew Ritchie, Autonomous. Please go ahead.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Hi, there. I wonder if you could just give us a bit more detail. One of the points of the
normalized review was on organization and governance. And I wonder, what was the
weakness identiﬁed in organization and governance? And how do you think you've
solved it, because I guess, there's not a lot of detail on that, I'm just curious to know what
was the problem identiﬁed.

Bloomberg Transcript

And then, in terms of the speed of any improvement, on the portfolio, you've identiﬁed
the 15 portfolios. I mean, I think commercial auto is about 40% of the loss within those
portfolios. And I guess, ﬁrst of all, what is the kind of tail and the speed of getting likely
improvement in commercial auto? I'm assuming, there's not that short tail of the auto
liability.
And of the other 60% of loss is being generated in this portfolio. Is it property? Is it
liability business? What is the tail and the speed of improvement on that we should think
about for those books? Thanks.

A - Kristof Terryn

{BIO 17664174 <GO>}

Hi, Andrew. Maybe let me start with the organization and governance part of the work
stream. I mean, really, two pieces within that. I mean, one is we looked at the overall set
up. And as part of that, we actually are driving a reduction of the number of people that
we have sitting in the global layer. And we announced a number there, I mean a reduction
of 200 positions. I mean, the basic principle is that we want to put accountability back in
the frontline, put it within the market. And I actually don't believe that the size of the
organization that we had at the top was commensurate with what needed to be done.
And that does not mean that we're not, at the same time, strengthening the control
environment.
I think what actually – if you go back to the governance on what has happened, I think it is
more around the right focus and the right strategic tiering. And I think in some areas, we
have just pushed growth over proﬁtability, and that's an area where we need to intervene.
I think, actually making things simpler at the top and with a smaller team, I think that
actually we'd be much more focused on a holistic picture of what needs to be done and
understanding the trade-oﬀs that need to be made between growth and proﬁtability.

FINAL

I mean, I don't think this is a fundamental issue when it comes to technical excellence. The
information is there. The KPIs are there. I mean, we are doing a full review on what some
of the leading indicators are that we can better assess some of the portfolios that are
trending away from us but, by and large, I mean we didn't ﬁnd any major gaps in the
control framework. It's much more around having the right accountability in the right
place and having the right focus in terms of what we're trying to accomplish in making the
trade oﬀs.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

So the information was there. It just wasn't linking strongly enough to the front line. Is that
a good summary?

A - Kristof Terryn

{BIO 17664174 <GO>}

So, I think there's a little bit of that. And then I think on the large losses, we have probably
been somewhat slow in recognizing what was a trend and not a one-oﬀ. So that's an area
and that is an area where we've done a deeper dive and we've made some of the points
around reducing our exposure, being careful where we actually allocate capital. We're
having to looking at what retentions are we willing to take on standalone risks, but also
through relationship. So these are all things that we're looking at. But I would say, by and
large, this is not an issue of not having the right information.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And this governance review has happened across all the units of GI?

A - Kristof Terryn

{BIO 17664174 <GO>}

That is correct. Yeah.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay. And on the tail of the business you need to improve?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Andrew, why don't I take that? I mean, if you look at GI overall, there are expectations of
the improvement we expect to see for the plan. The largest single theme is actually large
loss. I mean, I think it's over one-third of the improvement that we expect to achieve.
Some of that will come from commercial auto, but the vast bulk of it comes from property.
So the points that Kristof made at the beginning around how we approach underwriting,
risk acceptance accumulation, I mean, these are actually expected to have a much larger,
and obviously a much more immediate impact on performance.
I mean, beyond – I mean, just the issues that we have in the U.S. and Canada, which is
obviously where the main focus is, the team are working hard to be set up for January 1
renewals in a number of European markets on some of the retail lines. So we also expect
to have a signiﬁcant impact. I mean even though commercial auto stands out as one of
Page 9 of 25



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG

Date: 2015-11-05

the major challenges, it does have a longer tail line which means it takes longer to eﬀect
the change but it isn't going to be the key source of the overall underwriting
improvement.

Q - Andrew J. Ritchie

{BIO 18731996 <GO>}

Okay. Great. Thank you.

The next question is from Vinit Malhotra from Mediobanca. Please go ahead.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Hi there. Good afternoon. So actually, my question has sort of been answered, so I will still
put it just out there. The link between reserve issues and expenses, we have seen expense
cuts – and Kristof, you just mentioned the fact that control was not a problem. But is it –
this is the same problem that happened or similar problem happened in the German
Meine Allianz lines where the people who were watching the claims were not there
because of cost cuts. So if you could just reassure, I mean, once again, I apologize for
repeating the question but this has been a problem, and even in the reserve – reserves
are not part of this review, but we still do feel it surprise us. So if you could just clarify and
repeat, reiterate that the people who watch these reserves are being carefully – or that
process is complete. That's my ﬁrst question.
And second question is just on the – back on this NAC, could you just also reassure us that
the NAC also does a lot of the car dealers in America. And could you just reassure us that
the portfolio there is sort of okay and doesn't need any further reserving action? Thank
you.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

I'll start on the ﬁrst one and Kristof will take the second one. So on the reserving side of
things, I mean, if you look at the way the group's allocated resources, reserving is actually
one of the areas where we invested fairly signiﬁcantly last couple of years. We have an
ongoing program to improve the consistency of the reserving process globally. And while
it wasn't completely untouched by some of the eﬃciency eﬀorts, we've had last year and
this year, I mean the impact of that has been very modest on reserving.
I mean, I mentioned in the introduction to the call that, I mean, I think – I mean, we feel
comfortable that we have a good reserving process. I think some of the steps that we've
announced around, I mean trying to focus a bit more on the large loss side of things. So I
think if we're not so deep in the tail and not looking to accept quite so much volatility, it
make some of the – I mean, some of the decisions that you have to make about whether
something is bad luck, good luck is much more easy to deal with. So from a expense cut
perspective and a eﬃciency perspective, I don't see that that's had any impact on the
reserving process. And if anything, we're looking to obviously further strengthen the
reserving process.

Thank you, George. Thank you.

FINAL

A - Kristof Terryn

{BIO 17664174 <GO>}

So just to reiterate on the ﬁrst question on governance, I don't think this has anything to
do with lack of transparency. Again, I think it is around having the right focus, the right
strategic focus, making the right trade-oﬀs between growth and proﬁtability and
intervening more quickly. I think on the large loss side, I mean there, I think it is a trend
we're well aware of and we're taking the actions to address it.
And then on your second question around the impact on direct markets, I think some of
the strengthening in the U.S. order book was direct markets, but that is a much smaller
part of the overall strengthening that we did in Q3.

Q - Vinit Malhotra

{BIO 16184491 <GO>}

All right. Thank you, Kristof.

Operator
The next question is from Thomas Seidl from C. Bernstein. Please go ahead.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

Yeah. Thank you. Two questions. The ﬁrst is on the P&C target. I think you acknowledge
now that the baseline is 1 percentage point higher, but you're still conﬁdent that you can
improve 2 percentage point to 3 percentage point. You also say that rate changes are 1
percentage to 2 percentages sort of claims inﬂation level plus you say because of lower
volumes expense ratio is not improving. And expense ratio, if I remember correctly, after
H1, was the main driver of the 2-percentage-point to 3-percentage-point improvement in
the past. So, those two factors fall away.
So, how do you want to achieve the 2% to 3% if you want to do this with 16% of the
portfolio? That would mean roughly a 15% improvement of underlying margin with this
business, how realistic is this? It's my ﬁrst question.
Second question is capital. I wonder a little bit about the considerations you had on the
$3 billion excess capital in September. The stock price was at a very low level compared
to recent history. So what kept you from buying back then? Is it that you mainly expect to
deploy into organic and inorganic growth or what other thoughts have driven this
decision?

A - Kristof Terryn

{BIO 17664174 <GO>}

Yeah, let me take the ﬁrst question. So, on the eﬃciency side, as you know, initially we
targeted $200 million of savings in 2016. That number will be higher and is likely to
exceed $300 million in 2016. The reason that it won't have the impact as anticipated on
the eﬃciency, on the expense ratio is because, as we stated before, we're likely to see a
Page 11 of 25

FINAL

modest top line decrease. And the targets we set for local business units are very much
on an absolute expense basis, because I want to make sure that the focus, really, is on
proﬁtability and not volume.
On the second part of your ﬁrst question, we're not just tackling the 16% of premiums that
are in those 15 underperforming portfolios. I mean, we are taking actions across the
board. And while rate may be diﬃcult in this environment, a lot of the combined ratio
improvement, loss ratio improvement will actually come from lift, which is the
improvement on a loss ratio because of growing disproportionately the better tiers and
taking some very signiﬁcant and tough actions on the bottom tiers of the portfolio. So,
even with a low-rate increase assumption, I think that 2 points to 3 points improvement in
combined ratio is still an achievable target for 2016.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

But this is now, if I – to be absolutely sure here, this is now exclusively coming from the
loss ratio improvement. The expense ratio you should expect to stay ﬂat.

A - Kristof Terryn

{BIO 17664174 <GO>}

I think the majority will come from the loss ratio, I mean, the expense ratio will probably
be roughly ﬂat or marginally improving.

Thomas, on your second question on the capital side of it. Obviously, we're in a fortunate
position from a balance sheet perspective that we have a very strong capital position, and
we still estimate that we will have $3 billion available to us to deploy through the end of
2016. What you've heard from us today is that we'll resolve how that will be done with the
full year results in February and we'll give clarity to investors as to how we'll do it.
I mean, I guess if you look back, as we entered September, I mean, I guess, our intentions
were clearer at that point that we had intended to apply it inorganically. I guess today, it's
less clear exactly how that would be done. And I mean, we'll look at it as we go through
the year-end. The most important thing for us is value. So, given the choices that would
be available to us where do we the highest possible return for the beneﬁt of the
shareholders and that would drive the allocations in the end.

Q - Thomas Seidl

{BIO 17755912 <GO>}

The next question is from Nick Holmes, Société Générale. Please go ahead.

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 21515144 <GO>}

Hi there. Thank you very much. Two questions. The ﬁrst is coming back, sorry, yet again on
the expense ratio. I just wondered, I'm curious that you are not increasing the $1 billion
cost reduction target. I mean, I think you said you'd take the $200 million next year up to
$300 million. Why not take the $1 billion up because clearly top line is going to be under
pressure?

Bloomberg Transcript

And then second question is coming back on the $3 billion of capital and M&A activity,
would you be able – do you feel that you can make a bold statement like you would rule
out a major M&A transaction or is that like RSA was or is that something that you don't
want to say at this stage? And could you elaborate more on the sort of bolt-ons that you
might be contemplating? Thank you very much.

A - Martin Senn

{BIO 3241585 <GO>}

Hi, Nick. Let me comment ﬁrst with the issue on our eﬃciency program. The plan remains
to drive eﬃciency and cost savings through the organization of $1 billion-plus. That's got
to be more than $1 billion by the end of 2018.
With the review we have taken in GI, we have also stated that we look to accelerate and
reprioritize some of those investments or as well, let's say the initiatives. I think we have
shown with the comments from Kristof that this is happening, particularly as well with
regards to some of the head count reductions.
The other initiatives are ongoing with regards to continuous streamlining of the
organization. And with that, we want to deliver ﬁrst on these targets before we add
traditional cost savings program on top of it. I think that's the key priority. With regards to
the M&A, I hand over for that to George.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Hi, Nick. It's George. So I think we've actually made that bold statement already. I mean I
think that's really what happened in September. I mean, given the challenges we faced in
GI, we made it clear that that's the number one priority for us. So, for me, next time round
when they open up the possibility, we would execute a major acquisition. I mean, that

Page 13 of 25

FINAL

would be really odd. So I mean, I think this September was a statement of intent from us
around what the number one priority would be.
I mean as regards how we may deploy it between bolt-ons and capital return, I mean,
again – I won't go into that in depth today, but other than to say, I mean, value is the key
driver for us. If I look at the transactions that take place in the market today, you've seen
some recently, it strikes me they take place at levels that are above that, which would give
us the indicated return that we believe we would need for deployment of the capital. It
doesn't mean it's impossible but we're certainly very well aware of what the current
clearing prices are. It's diﬃcult to make things work at those levels. We continue to look
for opportunities to deploy capital for the beneﬁt of shareholders but value is the number
one driver.

A - Martin Senn

{BIO 3241585 <GO>}

Just to add to that, Nick, obviously, given what we just have said with regards to the
initiatives in General Insurance, it is somewhat unlikely that we will deploy signiﬁcant
capital in organic investment, and given as well the outcome on the discussion we had on
RSA. Inorganic opportunities are going to be likely to be bolt-on in nature as you're
striving, and we will not deviate from that in the past, but got to understand that we were
not sort of in a position to talk more in to that than where we stand at this point.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Nick Holmes

{BIO 21515144 <GO>}

Thank you very much for that. Can I just follow up? Just with another angle on this, which
is that, with the bolt-ons, I think with the RSA acquisition, you said that the timing was not
right. The GI business was not in the right condition. Now, with bolt-ons, is the GI review
making it more or less likely that you might make bolt-ons? But bolt-ons like this could
actually help you in some ways and I just wondered if you had any thoughts on that.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Maybe the one ﬁrst comment I'd make, Nick. I think when we spend ﬁve minutes
discussing bolt-on acquisitions, we leave people with the impression we have a giant list
of bolt-on acquisitions that were just waiting to use the $3 billion on. I don't want to leave
people with the impression that that would be the case.
I think when we consider adding to the portfolio that we have, I mean, it has to follow the
strategic direction we set in the past. So we'd have to strengthen distinctive positions that
the company has. It has to meet the ﬁnancial hurdles. There's a number of signiﬁcant
challenges that we would apply to the use of capital in any inorganic form.

Q - Nick Holmes

Q - Michael I. Huttner

{BIO 21417183 <GO>}

FINAL

Fantastic. I'm going to ask the same questions. Sorry. I really apologize for that. But good
for you for having – saying you're going to cut premium volume. There's one
inconsistency which is that you're saying the $3 billion gross, then deals, then return
money even though your language at the moment is more value, which I take to mean
return money.
And then on the non-life side, you're saying the problem was we didn't focus enough on
proﬁt and we focused too much on growth. So I detect there an inconsistency. And I want
to be really, really sure that the message internally is indeed proﬁt, not growth. There's a
mix to that which I'm wondering about.
And then the other thing which is really for George Quinn because you're much better at
this than I'll ever be. But you said or somebody said that the cost of capital for the
decision to allocate capital is partly dependent on the share price. So, let's assume that as
you pay your lovely [17%] dividend the share price slides as it normally does after
December. Let's assume the share price now is $300. At $300, would you imply the same
discipline which you're talking about at the moment which is really to kind of really brush
aside deals is the feeling I am getting and focus more on value which I take to mean
capital return? Or is $300 the level at where you think, oh, things look better now, cost of
capital is down, investors love us, we can go out and spend a bit of money. Thank you.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Thank you for your question. On the ﬁrst one, I guess, maybe we separate a bit. I mean,
what's happening operationally and the imperative we have that Kristof has talked about
rates to improve, what's taking place at the front line. There's no one there where we said
to them we've got some money we like you to spend. And they're all under a clear
instruction from Kristof and the GI leadership that the priority is proﬁt.
On the second topic, I mean, I guess, and you would understand this even better than I
would, I mean, that – I mean, basing the hurdle rates on the opportunity posed by your
own stock means that that's always a dynamic process. I mean, I think I wouldn't react and
we tried not to react to short-term changes in the share price. So if it goes signiﬁcantly up,
I don't think we'd automatically assume that the cost of capital has signiﬁcantly fallen.
And in fact I think if you go back to the, I mean, the last two investor presentations we've
given, I mean, we could debate what the cost of capital was when we gave those
presentations, but we set a threshold of 10%. And I think that, I mean, generally, in most
cases, I mean, even if the cost of capital appeared lower, I mean, you'd have to be very,
very careful about deciding you wanted to deploy capital at levels lower than that. But
having said all of that, I mean, obviously, it's our aim to try and drive value overall for
shareholders. I mean, if we see the share price rise to the kind of levels that we've
discussed and hopefully it follows the improvements that we've made, I mean, then that
decision would be a luxury problem for us, to be frank.

The next question is from Andrew Broadﬁeld from Barclays. Please go ahead.

Q - Andy D. Broadﬁeld

{BIO 7273415 <GO>}

Yeah. Hi. Good afternoon. Two questions, please. I think you've said that you are setting
sort of absolute cost levels of targets for the divisions within the GI. Could you just explain
what the basis for those targets is, whether it's sort of arbitrary x percent cuts or whether
it's more fundamental in terms of what's the competitive cost base for that line of
business?
The second question is just on the slide six, which shows the underperforming portfolios.
My question is, this is as at year-to-date. I'm always a little anxious for companies where
there's been a radical management change that there is – or within a business unit that
there is a sort of overreaction on near-term problems which perhaps look slightly diﬀerent
over longer term, and you end up just sort of chasing the last trade, if you like.

Bloomberg Transcript

What do those charts look like? Are they similar? Have you looked at them on a 3-year, 5year, 10-year view? And if so, and as a sort of follow-up to that, you mentioned that you'd
identiﬁed that Zurich had been slow to recognize some of the large loss trends. I just
wondered whether you could just articulate what those trends were or whether they were
simply within certain business units?

A - Kristof Terryn

{BIO 17664174 <GO>}

Okay. So, let me take those two questions, Andrew. So, on how we set the cost targets –
and let me make a distinction between 2016 and then the longer-term objective that
we're trying to accomplish.
I mean, so for 2016, we have set some absolute cost targets. I mean, these were a
combination of some of the initiatives that are already underway. Yeah. I mean, whether
that is lean, some of the centralization of the functions. And a combination then as well on
the assumptions we made on volume and the required resources for that.
So where in smaller part of the portfolio, we exited lines. I mean, that clearly has an impact
on the resources that are required and some of those actions we have taken immediately.
So, that's how I would categorize 2016. So it was a detailed assessment of what is
required, what are the initiatives that are already underway to make this business more
eﬃcient.
Now, on your point around the longer term on eﬃciency, I mean, it is clear that for us to
be competitive in this industry in the longer term, we need to continue to focus on
eﬃciency. We do look at where we stack up competitively. And that is also how we set the
strategic long-term target of achieving at least $1 billion of cost savings by the end of

Page 16 of 25



Company Name: Zurich Insurance Group AG
Company Ticker: ZURN SW Equity
Date: 2015-11-05

FINAL

2018. As you know, GI is the largest part of that. I mean, that should get us to a
competitive cost position.
So that's on the ﬁrst question. On your second question on page six, on the portfolios in
the short term versus the longer term, if you would actually look at previous years, I mean
some of the portfolios that are in the red buckets would've been underperforming, not to
the same extent, and depending on the year, I mean, 2014 was actually in hindsight for
some of these portfolios a relatively benign year in terms of large losses. So it is important
to take a long term view.
What we have seen, though, is a signiﬁcant deterioration in 2016 that has accelerated in
the ﬁrst half, and then going into Q3. When we talk about some of the things that we were
late to spot, I think in particularly that those are the large loss piece. I mean that is one
where I think we have been too slow to react. That is a key focus area. I think with the
actions again that we're taking, some of the volatility, some of the exposure to large losses
should absolutely come down. And I think that is the right thing, short term, but also
longer term.

Q - Andy D. Broadﬁeld

{BIO 7273415 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

Okay. Just on that last point, Kristof, I guess I don't feel, you said that 2014 perhaps some
of these had been benign for these and said that it accelerated in 2015 and got worse.
That feels like a very short time period to me making a decision and it doesn't sound like
a trend to me for a business that has a multi-year pattern.
So I guess, and also on the large loss points you're making, I mean, are you able to
articulate more fundamentally what those trends were, whether it's from lines of, very
speciﬁcally trends within the line of business that you just don't you can overcome or
trends in terms of your lack of your capabilities or scale or technological capabilities or
digital capabilities? It's just not clear to me that, you say they're trends but I'm not sure I
totally understand what those trends are given that they're not coming from long-term
trends in the business.

A - Kristof Terryn

{BIO 17664174 <GO>}

First of all in the views that we said that we took, I mean, we've taken a 3-year, 5-year and
10-year view on some of these portfolios. And when we look at the volatility and the
returns that they were generating, I think it is the right strategy going forward to reduce
the exposure and reduce the volatility.
When you look at the trend in large losses, I think there are a number of factors that are
playing here. I mean, there is the interconnectivity of risks. There is the aggregation across
diﬀerent lines of business that plays a role here and that is where some of the
fundamental analyses we are doing in terms of the large losses, some of the events that
we've seen should give us the right tools going forward to reduce that volatility.

Q - Andy D. Broadﬁeld

{BIO 7273415 <GO>}

The next question is from Sami Taipalus, Berenberg Bank. Please go ahead.

FINAL

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Hi, guys. Just to keep you on slide six to begin with. Obviously that 143% is not a great
number, but to be honest I don't think that 94% is a great number either, I mean, 94% is a
decent combined ratio for a lot of your peers in a normal year. But this is for the portfolio
excluding all the bad stuﬀ in what is actually quite a nice favorable weather year. So I'm
wondering what makes you think that you don't actually need to improve the rest of the
portfolio by quite a bit as well because it seems like quite a lot of the actions are focused
on the kind of orange bits that you've highlighted there. That's the ﬁrst question. And
then the second question is on reserves, could you just tell us a little bit more about this
reserve increase in construction liability, what it relates to, whether it's an industry issue
and maybe what underwriting years it comes from as well? Thank you.

A - Kristof Terryn

{BIO 17664174 <GO>}

Bloomberg Transcript

And so, Sami, let me take the ﬁrst question. I'll let George comment on the reserves. So,
just to make it very clear, the underwriting review that we did was very broad. I mean, it's
covered all portfolios and we have speciﬁc actions across all of our portfolios, because
you're absolutely right. Yeah. We're not going to get to the required combined ratio by
just addressing the 15 portfolios. The reason we've highlighted the 15 portfolios is that
some of the tougher actions we're taking where we're exiting lines of business, where
we're willing to see very signiﬁcant drops in retention, I mean, will clearly be focused on
those 15 underperforming portfolios.
But for the other US$17.7 billion NEP with the 94% combined, you're absolutely right, that
combined does need to improve. And that will again be a combination of looking where
do we need some rates. Tiering is something that we apply across the entire portfolio and
the extent of the actions that we take will probably be a little bit more moderate there
than on the underperforming portfolios. But by and large the underwriting review
covered the entire book, because clearly our combined ratio is not where it needs to be.

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Okay, is the philosophy the same in the other portfolios as well of kind of prioritizing
margins over volume there?

A - Kristof Terryn

{BIO 17664174 <GO>}

Yes. In general – I mean, you can absolutely make that statement. I mean, across the book
margin is the top priority over volume and that does not mean that some parts of our
book will not continue to grow, because we see continued good proﬁtability in parts of
our book. But as part of the rest of GI that US$17.7 billion, there will be parts of that book
as well that will see some shrinkage and will require some rate as well.

FINAL

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Sami, on the second part of your question on this sub-portfolio of construction liability, it's
not a particularly large product line for us; it's less than $200 million of earned premium.
But it's been signiﬁcantly impacted particularly in the 2012 and 2013 years for claims from
those two periods.
The preliminary announcement that we made in September had already contemplated an
increase. Again, as I mentioned earlier, I mean, given the outcome that we had for the
quarter, we also felt that we should take a more prudent view in this part of the overall
portfolio. We are market leader in this relatively small segment. The claims are quite
lumpy so they tend to be quite large in nature, so it does pose some reserving
challenges. But given what we've done, we feel we're in an appropriate position for
reserves for this line of business.

Q - Sami Taipalus

{BIO 17452234 <GO>}

Do you think it's fair to say that your kind of conﬁdence level on those reserves is quite a
bit higher than what it is on average across the whole book?

Bloomberg Transcript

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

I mean, it varies from area to area. In fact if I looked across the book, the areas that would
typically cause you more concern typically are like APH, A&E, workers comp, those types
of things. But these have all performed within our expectations. With the things we've
dealt with, obviously the steps we've taken here improves the conﬁdence we have in this
particular line, and in fact that's also true for what we've done in commercial auto in the
third quarter.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Hi, guys. Ralph Hebgen from KBW. I've got three things. One is back to the reserve
increase in the construction line I'm afraid. I would just like to understand perhaps better
your thinking of why you needed to increase these reserves following a proﬁt warning in
September where you knew you had to strengthen reserves but in other lines of business.
So in other words, I'd just like to explore what is behind your reserving philosophy now?
Is that particular reserve increase which we have known about now a sign of increased
prudence or is it a sign of heightened understanding of what your claims experience is
like and therefore was made necessary by developments which you became aware of

only after September 21? That was the ﬁrst question. The second question relates to cash
targets. You conﬁrmed again today that you stick by your target of more than $3.5 billion
of remitted cash in 2015. That number of course is now after sort of $800 million proﬁt
warning. I am guessing there's an underlying operating remittance of about $2 billion. So
I'm just wondering where does all this cash come from?
Well, that's really the question. What speciﬁc items are there that you are conﬁdent must
emerge before the year is out which support this level of cash to this order of magnitude?
And ﬁnally, just a numbers question. Would you be able to give us more insight into the
split between prior years and current years on the various reserve increases which you
have conducted? Thank you very much.

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Okay. That's cool. Perfect.

Bloomberg Transcript

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

... break down the numbers. So on the other two. So, on reserving, I guess I've tried to say,
I mean as carefully but as clearly as I can today that – I mean, essentially the way the
process has worked for us, I mean, we've reviewed the reserving position, I think we
mentioned already that we had the beneﬁt of the reserving process, actually running in
the few days prior to the September 21st announcement.
We reviewed all of the areas that we felt were relevant and we came to various
conclusions. And arriving at the number that we publicized in September, we allowed for
what would be a normal month of September for nat cat. As we've now closed the
quarter, we don't have a normal month, for the month of September, it's much lower. In
fact, I think it's – I think from what we had assumed, it's close to zero impact.
At the same time, we've looked again across the portfolio and we've decided to increase
the prudence that we have around this particular topic. I mean, it was one of the things
that was – actually in the estimate that we had in September but we have increased it.
Overall, as I mentioned earlier, the two items oﬀset and we end up back – almost exactly
the same position that we had led investors to expect.
Now, again I think I said in the intro to the call that I think I was well aware when we made
that decision that would trigger additional questions. But of the choices that were in front
of us, the one that we opted for seemed like the best one for me then. And to be honest,
it still seems like the best one to me today.
On the cash, the cash, well, I was going to say it's not very complicated; it's always a bit
complicated. So for 2015 I guess the good news is that the drivers of what drives cash for
Page 20 of 25

FINAL

this year are largely in the bag already. So it's cash remittance that we've had from
subsidiaries during the year. And the challenge of what's happened at the end of the year
is more likely going to aﬀect dividend ﬂows in 2016.
But the reason that you see the conﬁdence, I mean, not only around cash for this year but
also conﬁdence that we can continue to achieve the $10 billion that we talked about at
Q2, which of course exceeds the target level by about $1 billion. I mean that's driven by a
number of things. I mean the very basic thing it's driven by is when we gave the $10 billion
number we had an expectation that we'd be well above the $10 billion number. And even
if I knock oﬀ the after-tax proﬁt warning, it brings me down to a level where we're still
conﬁdent we can deliver the more than $10 billion.
I mean, practically what drove that higher number? One of the things that would certainly
drive it is Farmers. I think as everyone is well aware, we've had a program led by Jeﬀ and
the team to discuss with the key stakeholders a reduction in the capitalization of Farmers
Re. I'd say that the team have executed that extremely well and over the course of the
next 12 months to 18 months, as we've said previously, we expect to extract the vast
majority of the capital in Farmers Re.

Bloomberg Transcript

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Can I just follow up on that, on the cash, I mean, it's still the case that you have about
operating cash ﬂow of $2 billion now for 2015, which means that we have $1.5 billion at
least in speciﬁc items topping that up. But where does this come from? Is this already
some of the Farmers extraction not only from Farmers Re but also from the ﬂoating rate
note included in the solvency of the exchanges? Are you making more progress in the
extraction of that not quite $1 billion?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

So we're making exactly the progress that we have planned for. So, again, we said, I think
in the early part of this year, that we expected to extract all or almost all of that over the
next 18 months. And I guess I'm trying to signal as much as I can that our conﬁdence is
very high given the stage of completion that we're at with the various key stakeholders.
On top, I mean, it's not just Farmers. We also have, I mean, the GL team have been doing
good work. You see what we've done earlier this year around the annuity transaction, of
course, that helped. It's a one-oﬀ. We sold an asset manager in the UK, that again, helped.
And in fact, I mean, GL also has a target to reduce utilization of capital in some areas over
the course of the next 18 months. So, a combination of all of these things, I mean, more
than oﬀset the short-term weakness in the operating performance because of the proﬁt
warning this year.

Q - Ralph Hebgen

{BIO 6297020 <GO>}

Okay. And just one follow-up on the heightened prudence relating to your reserving
decision. Can we expect that this heightened prudence in reserving philosophy will also
aﬀect other areas of the business as you go forward, and as you conduct your regular
reserve reviews?

I guess all I could really do is repeat what I said at the introduction to the call. And I guess
as everyone knows by now, there are no absolute guarantees in reserving. I mean, these
are based on judgments of individuals looking at the facts before them. In this particular
quarter, we've taken the position to be more prudent around this particular line. We do
not anticipate that we'll make further changes in what's been a very consistent reserving
process.

Bloomberg Transcript

Yeah. Hello. Back in 2003, I think under Jim Schiro we had a presentation which
introduced The Zurich Way and one of the notions was driven by losses of the World
Trade Center where you had I think 12 contiguous buildings, in other words concentration
of risks. And we were assured in that presentation that under The Zurich Way, there'd be
no such concentration of risks ever again.
So I just wondered if you could talk about Tianjin? Surely that was a huge concentration of
risk. You've talked about volatility of risk but that seemed to be high concentration. You've
had losses way larger than any other insurer or reinsurer in that region. So what has
actually happened? You talk about governance issues. Did The Zurich Way book gradually
get torn up page by page? I mean what has actually happened?

A - Kristof Terryn

{BIO 17664174 <GO>}

Let me take that question, Mark. So, no, The Zurich Way book is still very much there, and
it's still what our underwriters use and The Zurich Way of underwriting is still very much
how we drive underwriting excellence.
When we look at concentration of risks, I think where we have been particularly strong is
when it comes to managing the aggregations of our property portfolio. I think the
interplay between business interruption and property risks, cargo, etcetera, I think that is
where I want to do a deeper dive and understand whether we have the right
accumulation management across all the diﬀerent lines of business in place. Now that
being said, we are one of the biggest players in the OEM space and you would have
expected that we would have had a disproportionate share of the Tianjin loss.

Q - Mark David Cathcart

{BIO 19783252 <GO>}

But it was still – wouldn't you argue too large a risk to take given the resultant loss?

FINAL

Well, this goes back to my comment on our large losses and the increase of large loss
frequency across the portfolio. When I look at the proﬁtability and, again, going back to
all the diﬀerent historical views, I mean, I don't think we're getting the right returns on
some of the large loss exposures that we're having.
So I would say more in aggregate across the portfolios, and this is particularly a global
corporate issue. We're not seeing the right returns on the large loss exposures that we're
writing. So the strategic review of looking at retentions, accumulation of retentions,
reductions of lines and use of reinsurance, I think, is the right answer to that issue.

Q - Mark David Cathcart

{BIO 19783252 <GO>}

So, you weren't unduly concerned by the concentration of risk in Tianjin?

A - Kristof Terryn

{BIO 17664174 <GO>}

Look, I mean, I think the fact that we had a disproportionate share was to be expected. I
mean, I do want to understand whether we can further improve our accumulation
management across diﬀerent lines of business. I think that is a fair point.

But you can say that since The Zurich Way was in store, there's been no lowering of
underwriting standards within the Zurich Group that's been adhered to?

A - Kristof Terryn

{BIO 17664174 <GO>}

That, I can absolutely say yes.

Q - Mark David Cathcart

{BIO 19783252 <GO>}

Yeah. So, what's the governance issue then?

A - Kristof Terryn

{BIO 17664174 <GO>}

I think it goes back to more how we strategically looked at the portfolio and how we were
pushing growth, not always at the right levels of proﬁtability. So, for me, this is much more
around how we steer the business, how we set priorities and being realistic about what
we can achieve in what is a softening market environment.

Q - Mark David Cathcart

{BIO 19783252 <GO>}

Okay. Thank you. Thank you.

FINAL

Good afternoon, guys. Just a couple of questions. Firstly, just going back to slide six,
could you give some ﬂavor in terms of how the 15 underperforming portfolios are split
between the diﬀerent regions in terms of international markets, Europe, et cetera or U.S.?
Secondly, also the other operating business line this year is running lower than expected.
How should we think of this in 2016? And also could you give the growth exposure to
Tianjin for you guys as well? Thanks.

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

Hey, Dhruv it's George. So on the ﬁrst one, can I ask you to again go back to IR and they
can help you with.

Q - Dhruv Gahlaut

{BIO 16209870 <GO>}

Sure.

On the OOB side of things, I mean, if you look at the traditional pattern that we exhibit,
the costs in OOB tend to be weighted to the second half of the year. I think from what I've
seen of the analyst estimates, certainly in prior periods, people understand that and
estimate it I think pretty well. I mean, OOB, we said earlier in the year that I mean I think
we were expecting something in excess of $900 million. I mean we're going to be lower
than that this year and that's partly driven by what we'd started to do in response to the
eﬃciency program that we announced back in May. But we've also had a number of
beneﬁts that I guess we couldn't claim complete ownership of, so we have lower
ﬁnancing costs in there and our hedging program has also generated in the year to-date
about a $75 million gain. So you need to back that out from OOB's performance. But I
mean that's clearly an area where we're going to target to drive further eﬃciency into
2016.

Q - Dhruv Gahlaut

{BIO 16209870 <GO>}

So what do you think the running would be if I could just follow up on that? What do you
think the running run rate would be going forward?

A - George Quinn

{BIO 15159240 <GO>}

The only reason I am hesitant is – in fact, I have a meeting with all of my corporate center
colleagues on Monday when we are going to discuss that particular number for next year.
So I expect us to bring it down but I don't have a precise ﬁgure I could guide you to yet.
That discussion is about to take place.

Q - Dhruv Gahlaut

{BIO 16209870 <GO>}

Okay.
